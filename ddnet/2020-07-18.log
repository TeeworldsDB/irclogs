07:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^ I think same happens for checkpoints
07:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> but not 100% sure
07:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> ninja skips tiles
07:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i think it can skip all cept kill and blocks
08:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> That behaviour is known and used in many maps
08:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'm quite sure it is more bugged than it was before, but will test it when I'm back home
08:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its not bugged
08:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Its kinda straight
08:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> you can skip any unsolid tile except kill and only 1 block wide
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> lol since when? You cannot skip multiple stoppers using ninja anymore? Doesnt that break maps?
09:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> I guess nothing of the behaviour is changed if i read this correctly
09:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mind> Hey, I found some inconsisten naming schemes within the editor. In the tooltip it states "Flip brush horizontal" and the button at the top uses X/X. When you use this option the tile will be flipped in horizontal DIRECTION. But when you turn Info on, it will be asigned with a V (for vertical), stating the LINE it was mirorred on. Imo you should decide for one of the two options instead of using both, since it's confusing.
09:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/733954591808421918/screenshot_2020-07-18_09-42-16.png
10:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @ChillerDragon no, stoppers still can be skipped no matter how much
10:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> but tiles that have a gameoption on them only one tile wide as always

14:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust protects you from things u dont even know
14:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> careful, you might wake people up 😛
14:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
14:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lets not wake learath :justatest:
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hswzps/readable_function_composition/
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look this
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can compose functions
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kinda cool
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, closures are no longer voldemort types? ^^
14:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like `#![feature(type_alias_impl_trait)]`
14:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it used to be the case that closures have a type that cannot be named
14:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but this seems to fix that
14:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
14:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but alas, it's not stable yet
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> cloudflare makes monopoly
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> then we get unstable services
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut where did you get the coala skins from? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1218
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not sure, from the forum maybe
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and the santa skins
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok
18:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think too
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Am woken up
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If size of vector doesnt change no need to invalidate iterators, if you are a dimwit that can't read the documentation for the container you use, I guess the rust compiler will save you from your idiocy
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let me look at the second beautiful example of the rust compiler showing off how it's smarter than the programmer
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah the second one is indeed cute, if you haven't heard of shared_ptr or atomics
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I sure.the marketing method of antagonizing their potential users and calling people who do perfectly sane things idiots in blogposts will help a lot with the growth
19:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> s/I/I'm/
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did you actually read the post
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `If any of these constraints is broken, the compiler rejects the code. There’s no need for std::shared_ptr just to defensively make sure that the memory isn’t freed under your feet.`
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is the point
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> "just to" that is the point to using shared_ptr
19:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur so mad i find it funny
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not mad, I'm just interested in why everyone is so interested in taking random claims as is without any exposition
19:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly, you could code in brainfuck for all I care
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust is coming to the linux tree
19:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw
19:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That,'s great to hear, it can mature in the driver tree for a while
19:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-languages-now-rust-project-looks-for-a-way-into-the-linux-kernel/
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "If building Rustic interfaces within the kernel requires some additional language features, we should see what enhancements to the language would best serve those requirements,"
19:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats great
19:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the good thing about a community driven and evolving language
19:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's the most clickbait summary I've seen but yeah. I read about it on the mailing list
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and actually the title is incorrect
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux wants to pull rust, rust never tried to push it
19:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be nice to see if rusts community will try to evolve the language so it fits well into the kernel code
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ARM also donated to rust
20:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to make arm toolchain tier 1
20:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> How much support from rust is needed anyway? LLVM is doing the assembling
20:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/raw-bin/rfcs/blob/promote-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-to-tier-1/text/0000-promote-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-to-tier1.md
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think rust just neeeded this
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "All necessary supporting infrastructure, including dedicated hardware, to build and run the Rust compiler and compiler tests reliably must be available openly."
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to make it a tier 1
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thus the donation helped
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they donated this https://www.packet.com/cloud/servers/c2-large-arm/
20:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah so corporate support kinda deal
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly I'd be surprised if rust had trouble compiling to any llvm target
20:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I wonder how arm is doing in server hw these days. Their fixed width ISA and thumb mode could actually give nice benefits
20:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what do you think about ECS in game engines
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see it works like treating the ECS as a database, you query components from a entity you have
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if its worth this overhead
20:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it helps organize things tho
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also the systems help with threading i guess
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I don't have a preference really. I think with how bad compilers are with devirtualization ECS might have better performance than inheritence approaches
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine tw with ecs
20:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's how I would have coded it probably
20:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> me too
20:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> after discovering ecs
20:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But I don't have a strong preference, inheritance can also look cute
20:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks to this https://amethyst.rs/ i learnt how it works
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually, systems would make the code cleaner in tw, you wouldnt need 100 points to other components (e.g the client)
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> points -> pointers
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is our failure honestly
20:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually generated a map of pointers between classes and was looking to eliminate some links to make the hierarchy more pyramidlike
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Than got distracted with massive ddos so worked on network code
20:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/342454474117218334/731609702017925200/3x.gif
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddos kiddos
20:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im surprised the tournament went rly well
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://learath2.info/kek.png
20:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what means red?
20:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly been a long time since I generated it, don't quite remember
20:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the cool thing about rust is that you can do it without shared ptr and the compiler will yell at you when you break some invariant so that it is no longer allowed
20:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. the rust code doesn't contain the unneeded atomic reference counting, but will not break when one modifies it
20:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can achieve minimum cost in both languages, rust just seems to make it easier to minimize it, which is nice
20:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and it is sufficient to locally understand the code when one changes it

20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> matching with tuples
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rly cool
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I know matching with tuples
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hp6guz/what_feature_of_rust_is_used_very_often_by/
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> interesting thread
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> indeed useful, but that is a fizzbuzz
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the opposite of interesting
20:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
20:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that implementation is nice tho
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not IMO
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> too indirect

20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check out rocket if you like this
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i already use rocket
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it will also come to stable
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah nice
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 1.45 rlsed
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you like it?
20:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I never wrote a project in that framework
20:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love the request guards
20:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt use it much tho, no ideas
20:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rocket looked nice
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my bad rust code

20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd probably use go for most of that kind of work, it looks far more suitable
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> go is nice
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i feel it kinda lacks a mature and good framework
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont feel satisfied
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rocker makes it a joy
20:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt find that in go
20:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, that's why I've been waiting on looking at go
20:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It honestly looks like the only language where concurrency is a first class feature of the language
20:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://pastebin.com/Dr0bdj9n
20:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look how many times i check err != nil

20:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a bit sad
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I'm a huge fan of the old pattern

20:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exception pattern seems nice but losing locality in your errors makes them very hard to actually handle, hence everyone else and their mothers suggest you die on most exceptions
20:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> skin authors
20:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now we need to find at least Whis, Ravie, Moby Dog, perhaps Miper

20:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Ravie is here, at least
20:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Moby Dog I can probably reach
20:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so whis is the most problematic
20:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> just trace the ddos ips :troll:
20:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not sure who whis is, tbf. The name is roughly familiar but the whis here seems to be associated with vali, which I don't remember whis being a ddosing dickweed
20:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whis made lot of skins

20:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
20:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> new list
20:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also need Zerodin for Kobra 4 and TyxpekCZ for Goo!, although these are probably more replaceable
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The maps we probably dont even need to ship, I guess it makes it easier to launch a server
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yall should ship with a tutorial to mapping map
20:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> or a map with some info on how to work with a server
20:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> looks like CGC is super class
20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would be good to have a map, doesn't have to be Kobra 4
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a ddnet map, preferably
20:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Konsti let us CC0 all his maps, if only he didnt only make brutals
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have a solo map and a brutal map
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the solo map is kinda good but not easy for a noob

21:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
21:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> how about "gold mine" (<BµmM>) https://ddnet.tw/maps/Gold-32-Mine  or "seasons" (Knight :3) https://ddnet.tw/maps/Seasons
21:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have contact info of the latter?
21:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> no
21:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I made a moderate and a novice map but no rls :feelsbadman:
21:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if you can contact hi_leute_gll
21:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he probs can direct you
21:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to knight
21:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe not

21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> whether you use retard, nigger, shit, fuck or what ever isn't relevant
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
21:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> heinrich said the n word

21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> reacting to urself
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And the discordcops will shut us down, stop this risky speech
21:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> It already happened in ZDF
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> discord moderators also are nationalists
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 u must have a hard time playing dota 2
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a insult shithole
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i include myself tho
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lots of mothers fucked
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I wonder how used are whis' skins
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> literally 90% of skins are made by whis
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Even mine
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki there's a mute functions for people abusing the chat
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ᶰ°Konͧsti this whis in this sv is troll right
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its Whis
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> atlas by whis
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> also beast by his
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> atlas is gone
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> not
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> atlas was doubled
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> several people are typing
21:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> One been deleted
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if valve would license us atlas
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 some companies grant you the permission to use some stuff tho
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://odinlaw.com/how-to-add-easter-eggs-to-your-game-legally/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20concept%20of%20Easter,more%20likely%20an%20acceptable%20reference.
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> some quite popular ones were by whis
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Overall, the concept of Easter eggs are legal. But it can be easy to infringe on copyright or trademarks depending on how an Easter egg is implemented.
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If a developer has its own creation and its own design that mimics an existing mechanic or reference in another game, it’s more likely an acceptable reference. If it references the developer’s own prior works, it’s even more likely acceptable.
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If a developer extracts an exact model of an asset in another game or clearly recreates its existing design, the developer may be infringing on copyrights of the original creator. Developers cannot and should not copy and paste another’s work. Period.
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can the skin be considered a easter egg?
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably not
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not just some one-off animation somewhere in the client
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i build easter eggs in any of my maps
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is a map
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with a anime image
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Theres a map with Osama bin laden image lmfao
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Tunak tunak tun
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ddnet.tw/mappreview/?map=Ghoul
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> so
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> delete ghoul :troll:
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> main priority: find a way to contact whis
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> did he play as =whis= maybe?
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is this server's CuBe =CuBe=, anyone know htis?
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @Whis we need the hugest Designer
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Im friends with Whis
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :feelsamazingman:
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @CuBe are you =CuBe=? was whis in your clan, do you have contact info?
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> yes its cube
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @heinrich5991 @Whis is real Whis xD
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please stop that… :/
21:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ?
21:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Hes is Definitely real
21:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unless you actually believe that the whis in this server made the skins that are shipped in ddnet client, please take your offtopic stuff somewhere else
21:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> dude
21:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Im not trolling
21:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, sorry
21:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was assuming you were
21:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Im friends with Whis and this guy is the real Whis, at least he is having the design skills
21:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> since when does your whis play?
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Whis wasnt playing for a long time
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> its probably the real whis
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i think heinrich doesnt believe it because he assumes the "new" Whis would be a ddoser and racist :feelsbadman:
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> thats true too
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> but is the real one tho xd maybe he didnt behave like that in the old times
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe he just grew to be a racist ddoser? People change in odd ways
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I wonder why im friends with him
21:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :konstitroll:
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> @heinrich5991 AFAIK, `Knight :3` and `hi_leute_gll` are no longer active at all, so there's probably no way to contact them.
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Unless @Melio knows anything more...
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> 
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> And by the way, why do you need it for? All skins & maps are going to get licensed finally?
22:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at least the ones we ship with the client
22:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm in favor of licensing the rest of the maps as well, but the priority is on the stuff we ship with the client
23:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> 👍
23:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Bixes is alive
23:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> how to officially give cc0
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ?
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ᶰ°Konͧsti okay, we can make it official now if you want
23:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> allow me to clarify the difference between CC-BY and CC0 quickly
23:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> CC0 means that anyone can take your map and create a new version of it without crediting you
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> CC-BY means that anyone can create a new map out of yours but has to credit you
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> personally, I'd probably go for CC-BY for my maps, but you're ofc free to choose
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> ok in this case i give CC-BY
23:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> `DuMoH` is also known under the nick `locr1d` if that helps. Either he is the author of https://ddnet.tw/skins/index.php?search=DuMoH or knows who created it
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> honestly the client skins couls use some cleaning up, can delete all the ugly unfitting ones
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> honestly the client skins could use some cleaning up, can delete all the ugly unfitting ones
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> dude heinrich
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> why are u again bringing this up
23:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> oh and by the way miper has been posting on teeworlds forum a bit not long ago
23:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> check #admin @jao
23:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because of steam launch
23:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> what has konsti have to do with steam launch
23:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> im against license but i think giving CC-BY is the same thing were doing tight now
23:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nothing, @ᶰ°Konͧsti wanted to do it by himself
23:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> so how is it related to #admin
23:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> licensing maps and included custom mapres seems like a good idea but sadly I don't think most people would care
23:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that is not, I thought you were referring to the rest
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> big discussion incoming
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> xd
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah @heinrich5991 why are you trying to license maps? did you torture Konsti in a CIA blacksite to let us license his maps?
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> how can u be so persistent and annoying about it
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i just want to pretend myself from doing Aoe move "IM RAGING DELET MY MAPS"
23:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean it is a well known fact that all mappers do indeed hate licensing, they are all hasedic
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think anyone who put enough effort into his maps would like to have some control over how it gets used
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> jao could just add rule "by publishing your map to testing section you give all rights about it do DDNet" xd
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> discussion was finished last time, now he comes again and creates issues about it
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I only created an issue about the skins
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then only for konsti so that we remember it
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> because steam wouldn't release the client with the copyrighted skins
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I explicitly said "Incomplete list, only if the author contacts us for now."
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> i dont care about skins
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you know turns out, corporations care about licensing
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> honestly, who would have thought
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> why are you so against licensing maps? the only downside I see is that people simply wouldn't care and do whatever they want anyway
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I certainly didn't spend like 4 hours trying to argue that having licenses to things we publish is better than not having it
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Maybe it happens that DDNet becomes popular on Some way and we get problems with licenses? xd
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Welf> imagine maptesting when you have to check if any of the parts might be stolen from one of like 1k+ maps
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u dont have
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Welf it's not our responsibility if people infringe other peoples licenses
23:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> man u dont have to license our maps for steam
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> or are u going to restrict steam clients to ddnet servers
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> so there is no way people can end up on unlicensed maps
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah yeah whatever, licenses are the work of devil
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> good that u agree
23:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll go have a sip of holy water to cleanse my tongue of this evil
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> i dont get it
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> we had this discussion already
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> and u still start it another time
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, you said it's annoying to mappers, we said we'll make it simple, you said we can't
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> discussion had
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> there is nothing simple about licenses
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Beef between two admins 😂
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> LETS GO
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> idc but if u gonna go for it i give it
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> u dont even know what u opted into
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> what im saying
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you sure Konsti, god forbid, we might do unthinkable things to your map, like releasing it without credit
23:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i said at last
23:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> no one knows what licenses you want to make mappers accept unless u are a lawyer
23:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> CC-BY
23:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then we can't even not give credit 😦
23:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly want to die every time you say this
23:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> > unless u are a lawyer
23:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> u want to believe everything is that easy
23:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i think credit is important, changing to the maps might be ok
23:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> why is there a 1000 line faq about the license then
23:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I see myself raging when heinrich changes physics and my maps wont work anymore
23:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because people might ask questions, god forbid
23:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> With CC-BY u can fix it without me Saying f4
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Apparently you don't and you can't possibly understand the implications of CC-BY without having a law degree
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> facts
23:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> xd
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are not a lawyer either, how are you so confident?
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Welf> i am somewhat of a lawyer myself
23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> because there is a reason why lawyers exist
23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's absolutely batshit insane to think one can't understand anything without having a degree in it. Especially when the entire point is for this to be approachable for the layperson
23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if law was so easy there wouldnt be need for lawyers
23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> im jao
23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What do you need? For me to hire a lawyer?
23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> change my mind
23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> You are Konsti
23:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Changed your mind
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> i will trust a lawyer
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fine I'll get one, which fucking country do you want one in and the fuck do you want him to say?
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Welf> Maybe "Trafalgar Law" is a lawyer
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> but i wont trust heinrich
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> especially since hes kinda hypocritical
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Maybe "Welf" is a lawyer
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lmao
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whatever, heinrich = devil. Country? What do you need verified?
23:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> jao is the best testing Admin
23:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Heinrich is not devil :(
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Welf> i trust heinrich
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> there are some maps with copyrighted images from other games btw, for example that mario map
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly can't believe how you can delude yourself into thinking the dozens of actual lawyers that write these licenses don't know shit about copyright law and are just tricking everyone that uses these licenses
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ye exaclty
23:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> i think u cant even legally license maps
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if they contain tilesets or other maps
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like it's all fun and games, a bunch of lawyers sitting around in a room giggling at how they are fucking all the artists over
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> I wouldn't mind licensing all custom tilesets in my maps in a way that people have to state if they made changes
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> unless the other tilesets or maps have a compatible license
23:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is the endgame? Just waiting until enough people use the license so they can activate their trap card "loophole" and stealing everyones art?
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Which part of the
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Adding licenses, especially if the map/skin creator decides himelf, is not harmful at all, yet not having it might be problem in the unknown yet events in future
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> you don't get? Even Konsti got it without problems (no offence & notroll)
23:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> konsti didnt get anything
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> he just did it because heinrich said it
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, konsti got scammed by me and heinrich
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I didn't say he should license his maps
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that is wrong @jao
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> u could have told him anything
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> even if that's true, it's not your business nor your reponsibility to say that he decided for license randomly
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> big yeet, I'll sell his maps on the somalian black market with this license
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> he did it because u talked about it
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> but he didnt collect info about what he was doing
23:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Welf> konsti got Paid for saying all this
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> ofc he decided for it randomly
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> if heinrich told him another license he would have accepted it too
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ravie> konsti is clearly too stupid to understand how a basic license works and is just saying things
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Soreu> Well, just to add some logs to the fire: I already decided how my map & skin should be licensed. And so, I want to see those licenses added.
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> He was looking to do it with CC0, heinrich told him the options, he chose CC-BY instead
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> heinrich told him the cc0 too
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> but obv I was DMing him in the background to make our case look better
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> last time
23:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeet
