04:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I feel like I'm always busy
04:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and I kept sleeping through weekends

05:01 < bridge> <Ewan> the worst
07:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> good morning european gang

08:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> ‚òï
08:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> with a coffee
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> sweet
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i made some cold brew
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> it's nice
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> all the ones u buy in a bottle at the store have a weird aftertaste
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> mine does not. tastes like coffee
08:21 < bridge> <Ewan> i consider this a win
08:52 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> üçµ
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> what does this mean
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> cold coffee?
09:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not knowledgeable
09:12 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs brewed by long exposure to the grounds at a lower temperature
09:12 < bridge> <Ewan> as opposed to a short exposure at high temp
09:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @ryozuki are you a coffee addict
09:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
09:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i take 2-3 a day
09:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wdym take
09:31 < bridge> <TsFreddie> like you take your coffee like a pill or smth
09:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> drink
09:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
09:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> mimimimi
09:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also 2 or 3 sounds a lot actually
09:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> for me at least
09:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> weak
09:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
09:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> truth tho
09:32 < bridge> <TsFreddie> true tho
09:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> why r u chatting
09:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should be working
09:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
09:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't want to
09:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> hired a new guy and I was taking him around and introducing him to the team and project
09:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm already tired
09:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
10:03 < bridge> <Ewan> weird i don‚Äôt remember any of this
10:09 < bridge> <ar1gin> does 6-7 cups of tea a day count as addiction? :pepeW:
11:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I was wondering how you would drink tees until I realised that I read it wrong
11:35 < bridge> <deen> Yes: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032723010820 (/s)
11:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think Milk tea here is referring boba milk tea which is just a sugary drink. Given it is conducted in China and the authors are primarily Chinese.
11:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> 6-7 bobas per day would be an explosive amount of sugar intake :kek:
11:42 < bridge> <learath2> I don't have boba very often but whenever I do it's always half sugar
11:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> i always read boba as booba
11:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont drink any sugary drinks
11:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> coke zero too
11:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:46 < bridge> <learath2> Good reason to drink boba
11:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> well maybe some has little sugar but u know
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> coffee without sugar too
11:47 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, it‚Äôs pretty rare for me too
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> u know its so easy to drink them
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> and they have as much calories as a full meal
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i saw some insta story
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> like 700 cals
11:48 < bridge> <learath2> Sometimes I‚Äôll get this urge to have one of those extremely sugary starbucks drinks, but other than that not really
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> a big mcdonalds drink somewhere in america
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> the only time i went to starbucks was on japan
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz i didnt know where to breakfast
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i went to the starbucks at shibuya
11:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> where u have a view
11:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> of the whole street
11:49 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, yep it‚Äôs a cool view
11:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> all seats separated by walls
11:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> pretty japanese
11:50 < bridge> <learath2> I had a drink in starbucks japan that was completely baffling. It was like just cream with a bit of sugar and ice
11:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> omg
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 does clang not support mtune
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://bugs.gentoo.org/915464
11:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok it isnt that
11:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
11:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think firefox is trying to use clang 17
11:56 < bridge> <learath2> It should, the command line interface is usually not different
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> OH
11:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> its trying to use clang 17 from usr local
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> which i installed cuz mlir
11:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
12:25 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I'd just drink diet pepsi
12:46 < bridge> <TsFreddie> you can probably tell your local starbucks to make you exactly that if you know what's in it?
12:48 < bridge> <learath2> Why would I, it wasn't enjoyable at all üòÑ
12:49 < bridge> <learath2> Just a cup full of sweetened cream sold as a Frappuccino
13:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 did u finish uni yet
13:12 < bridge> <learath2> One more exam, neverending uni :pepeW:
13:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd

13:47 < bridge> <chairn> i think 5 is the lower bound for too many coffees üòÑ
13:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest:
13:50 < bridge> <chairn> are you looking for internship üòõ ?
13:51 < bridge> <chairn> are you interested in fault injection ?
13:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> fortran still lives, it's in the backend of numpy, for example. but I agree that at least cobol (maybe also fortran, not sure) is viewed as obsolete
13:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> @chairn do internships pay well?
13:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> its sad but the world will probs not pay what learath initially deserves
13:57 < bridge> <chairn> no, we're public service, so the bare legal minimum
13:57 < bridge> <chairn> so 550‚Ç¨/month i think
13:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn
13:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats low
13:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 just find a company showing off ur github and contributions to ddnet, tell thjem to ask u C questions
13:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u get a well paid job xd
13:58 < bridge> <chairn> and it needs to be at least 8 weeks, otherwise it's unpaid
13:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> well in spain its 3-4 months
13:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> and unpaid
13:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> unless u reach a agreement which is usually not case
13:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u have to do it
13:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> well im not talking about uni internships
13:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk how they do those there
13:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> but probs the same ngl
14:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ozu laser, mindustry, probably others I forget. but still up there
14:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> osu client is open source
14:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> not the server tho iirc
14:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> @chairn is there a big disparity among ur students
14:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> in what u feel what they know
14:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> like, did u find someone that clearly knows way more than others
14:01 < bridge> <chairn> obviously yes
14:02 < bridge> <chairn> especially in M2 where we got different origins of students, including international ones
14:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> any ddnet player? xd
14:05 < bridge> <chairn> how would i know üòÑ ?
14:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> could they know ur discord handle here
14:06 < bridge> <chairn> i should buy a ddnet shirt maybe
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> and if they chatted here they would know?
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:06 < bridge> <chairn> discord is banned on uni network
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> damn
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh ddnet used to sell em
14:06 < bridge> <chairn> i know, but i never bought one
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://ddnet.myspreadshop.de/
14:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> here
14:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean maybe u get bullied a bit
14:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> but xd
14:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> @_voxeldoesart when design a nice teeshirt
14:09 < bridge> <chairn> why would i ?
14:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> just joking
14:25 < bridge> <cyberFighter> what was the price
14:55 < bridge> <kaaylooon> 100%
14:55 < bridge> <kaaylooon> highest concurrent players

15:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> how can vscode know ur cmake is there?
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> tryu to understand whats asking for
15:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> i found it funny u have this in ur bio https://whyasking.me/
15:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> u should apply it
15:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur problem is not a ddnet specific one btw
15:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> but ill tell u
15:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> u have to add a config in vscode pointing to the cmake binary
15:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> path
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Bad CMake executable: "". Check to make sure it is installed or the value of the "cmake.cmakePath" setting contains the correct path
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:26 < bridge> <kaaylooon> cuz nothing there works
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> it does
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u dont even need to google
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> u just need to read
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> which most ppl dont
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> they see a error and cry
15:26 < bridge> <kaaylooon> ok, ty
15:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> @kaaylooon add this to ur bio http://www.readthefuckingmanual.com/

15:28 < bridge> <kaaylooon> cringe
15:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> real
15:32 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Who likes reading first :cluless:
15:32 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> I read only after 20 installed packages and when it still doesn't work
15:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:36 < bridge> <chairn> exactly, all my students do the same...
15:37 < bridge> <chairn> that's why i put a prerequisite in all my classes:
15:37 < bridge> <chairn> -know reading
15:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD

16:34 < bridge> <deen> We don't really sell them. I just set up the designs on spreadshirt, but they earn all the money
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/warp-drives-best-hope-dies/
16:44 < bridge> <learath2> I was thinking job, but if it's interesting enough, sure
16:46 < bridge> <learath2> Like hardware fault injection (glitching) or in the more general systems sense of it? I was curious about the former but not something I ever really explored beyond idle research
16:46 < bridge> <learath2> no idea, it's been 5 years since
16:47 < bridge> <deen> Are you interested in working with complex Rust code? üòÑ (Not sure if we are currently hiring developers though)
16:48 < bridge> <learath2> I'm fairly sure my level of Rust is not adequate for being hired for any Rust job, though I learn quick üòÑ
16:56 < bridge> <learath2> This feature ended up being not used when we managed to recover the saves from a log
16:56 < bridge> <learath2> Maybe we can just remove it tbf
17:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can see u cursing rust at work xdd
17:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.phoronix.com/news/GNOME-MR-Drop-X11-Session
17:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks
17:15 < bridge> <zwelf2> Ye, I'm all for removing. It just bothered me that it was broken xD
17:15 < bridge> <zwelf2> Ye, I'm also for removing. It just bothered me that it was broken xD
17:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 is it bad that openrc uses pidfiles?
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> a systemd user told me this
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:17 < bridge> <learath2> What is wrong with pidfiles in your opinion? The only issue is that there is a possible race, but what's the worst that could happen?
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> they say they are less robust
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> and that they are recicled
17:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> less robust to supervise
17:18 < bridge> <learath2> Ofc it's less rebust, the fix is not to replace the entire init system and the core of your system with a blackbox
17:19 < bridge> <learath2> Sorry, completely transparent box that is filled to the brim with code that only 2 people can read so it's effectively black*
17:21 < bridge> <learath2> `runit`'s approach to it is the proper way IMO
17:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> does  gentoo use runit
17:22 < bridge> <learath2> No, but you can experiment with it if you want to, I did set up a system with it once following the wiki
17:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> lfs?
17:22 < bridge> <learath2> (Same approach Windows uses btw, having a service supervisor)
17:23 < bridge> <learath2> No in gentoo https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Runit, you can have it run under openrc
17:24 < bridge> <yekrm> In which directory is this database located? :owo:
17:24 < bridge> <yekrm> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1160960919401148518/image.png?ex=6536901c&is=65241b1c&hm=201b4f8176cf2d2eb88cbbdce5c81d2ae099bdf7188da6ad8dc9336090a2dd17&
17:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> find a sqlite file
17:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> is this a server log or a client log
17:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:25 < bridge> <learath2> The supervisor uses a named pipe instead of a pidfile and signals, avoiding the issues with the pidfiles
17:26 < bridge> <learath2> I'm not sure but it should be in one of the below:
17:26 < bridge> <learath2> a) Next to `DDNet-Server` executable
17:26 < bridge> <learath2> b) Config directory
17:26 < bridge> <learath2> c) Data directory
17:30 < bridge> <yekrm> a)
17:30 < bridge> <yekrm> If I change the ddnet-server, will the database be deleted too?
17:33 < bridge> <robyt3> If it's in the same folder as `DDNet-Server`, the you could lose the database when you reinstall/update
17:33 < bridge> <robyt3> Check if you have another `sqlite` file in your config dir
17:33 < bridge> <robyt3> If you don't, move the database to the config dir
17:34 < bridge> <robyt3> If you have a file in both locations, then decide which to keep and delete the other
17:37 < bridge> <yekrm> - I can't find the sqlite file
17:37 < bridge> <yekrm> - Database works fine
17:37 < bridge> <yekrm> - If I update the server to a recent version of Github it still works and loads the database
17:38 < bridge> <yekrm> :kek:  idk
17:39 < bridge> <zwelf2> For me the database is at `~/.local/share/ddnet/ddnet-server.sqlite`.
17:40 < bridge> <zwelf2> The `$USERDIR`
17:41 < bridge> <robyt3> $configdir
17:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Unless you are using an older version, the database should be in the config dir
17:41 < bridge> <yekrm> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1160965250418487419/image.png?ex=65369425&is=65241f25&hm=c45e1a9634e756554adcd787df1f0c6e3c1a4e6ae54224e510297ab0b3f55ffe&
17:41 < bridge> <yekrm> Thx
17:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Because we don't want to write any files to the binary dir, which would cause issues on Windows
18:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> a problem with pidfiles seems to be that they're not guaranteed by the OS
18:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they can get out of sync, there are races
18:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> whatever API systemd uses to know the processes of a service is probably more appropriate(?)
18:27 < bridge> <learath2> Cgroups
18:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups. yes, looks like the correct API for process management
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> Which openrc also creates nowadays, though no one bothered using them in `start-stop-daemon` yet, presumably since problems of pidfile races are rare enough
18:42 < bridge> <reitw> systemd rip
18:42 < bridge> <reitw> debian 12 decided to be full systemd
18:51 < bridge> <reitw> (rip crond, /etc/network/interfaces , syslogd etc... on a default install
19:04 < bridge> <Ewan> rip
19:43 < bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 do you remember why we wanted curl-multi? ü§î
19:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> request sharing sockets IIRC
19:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not doing one OS thread per request is a nice side effect
20:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> reached a dead end?
20:06 < bridge> <learath2> Having trouble deciding what to do, so I guess the opposite of a dead end
20:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> curl multi finished? üòõ
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> No as in I have like 3-4 ways I can imagine curl multi being done and I can't decide on any of them
20:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
20:09 < bridge> <learath2> I think I'll just go back to the one in #5902 for now and call it a day
20:09 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5902
20:09 < bridge> <learath2> #5092 *
20:09 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5092
20:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> does one of them address the "I want to do something after the HTTP request finished" problem?
20:10 < bridge> <robyt3> I'd love to have a better job system in general
20:10 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, but it's also like dozens of hours of work writing a nice implementation of futures which won't be liked anyway due to the templates needed to get something like that to work
20:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I see
20:11 < bridge> <learath2> I started sketching one out with futures promises and executors similar to but simpler than folly's
20:12 < bridge> <learath2> I guess I can also make it happen with 5092 but in a non-generic just wait on the http job in a new CJob kinda way
20:14 < bridge> <learath2> but it's kinda obvious even looking at the rough sketch of it that something like this is a lot of work

21:24 < Brezzel> Just a quick question, is it possible to bug through tp. Without triggering tp ?
21:44 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
22:04 < bridge> <skystrife.> yes with tp gun + jetpack(or autoclicker) + tune down gun fire delay + 2 tees with nocol you can bug through all the tele you want. (easier to do with dummy copy but jetpack allows you to do it 2p).  very specific conditions so it wont ever just come up in a map, but you can map a part that does this
