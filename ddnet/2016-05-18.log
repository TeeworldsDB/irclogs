22:03 <@deen> Lots of fun about syscalls in x86-64 VMs: "Instead, for 64-bit PV guests, both guest kernel and guest user-space need to run in ring 3, each with their own address space. Every time a guest process needs to make a system call, it has to bounce up into Xen, which will context-switch to the guest kernel. This not only takes more time for each system call, but requires flushing one of the key CPU caches, called 
22:03 <@deen> a TLB. Frequent flushing of the TLB causes all execution to run more slowly for some time afterwards, as the TLB is filled up again."
22:35 <@heinrich5991> "translation lookaside buffer" :)
22:43 < sikusoccer> anyone here?
