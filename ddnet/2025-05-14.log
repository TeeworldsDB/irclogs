01:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> (no I'm just kidding I trust there are plenty more Windows users who are misguided when it comes to privacy)
01:54 < bridge> <Ewan> it showed embedded when i sent it, but looking back, you‚Äôre right
07:26 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Morning static dispatch enjoyers and others
07:27 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
07:27 < bridge> <Ewan> where are the dynamic dispatch haters
07:46 < bridge> <zhn> i still have xd, only with ddnet though
08:22 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Has anyone thought about adding a captcha before joining a server to fix these spam messages? xd
08:56 < bridge> <f1z3r.> what should I do if I'm not looking for a server?
08:57 < bridge> <f1z3r.> I have a good Internet connection, though.

09:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> It ded
09:20 < bridge> <Assa> do you mean you don't find any servers in the server browser? :thonk:
09:21 < bridge> <noctua5283> @essigautomat hei i have same problems after steam-update i cant refresh any servers ohter ppl have same problems
09:22 < bridge> <Assa> can you check this in browser? https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json
09:23 < bridge> <Assa> you should see "servers:" and then like a few thousand entries
09:23 < bridge> <noctua5283> i can see all servers, but we cant refresh it
09:24 < bridge> <Assa> oh
09:24 < bridge> <noctua5283> browsser sayss on server are 20ppl but thhere is nobody
09:24 < bridge> <noctua5283> ohter server says there are 20 ppl but server is full
09:24 < bridge> <Assa> I can reproduce this üíÄ
09:25 < bridge> <Assa> does this only happen with 19.2? I am sure this should happen to all clients
09:26 < bridge> <noctua5283> i installed today new update after that it wass sstuck at browserlist
09:27 < bridge> <noctua5283> I have already uninstalled it and re-downloaded it from Steam and from the homepage, both without success.
09:28 < bridge> <Assa> the list the masterserver sends seems to be static, matador and melon also pointed this out
09:29 < bridge> <Assa> so this is not a client issue, you can't fix this on your own. The only thing you can do is add your favourite servers to your favourits and check them manually
09:32 < bridge> <noctua5283> hmm ok
09:55 < bridge> <f1z3r.> yes
09:57 < bridge> <Assa> @f1z3r. at least you should be able to pull the old / not updating list
10:17 < bridge> <f1z3r.> no, I can't look at it, I'm getting a list of servers from the master server, it takes 30 minutes to load.
10:18 < bridge> <Assa> Then you have an internet issue on your site ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10:37 < bridge> <f1z3r.> Bro, no, I have a good Internet connection.
10:38 < bridge> <Assa> if you need 30 minutes to load this list from the browser, then there is some kind of connection issue
10:38 < bridge> <oxyzo.> others have this issue too
10:39 < bridge> <Assa> be mroe specific? The list not loading at all or getting the list, that is not updating?
10:40 < bridge> <Assa> if "others" are like all player from russia, it's still a connection issue
13:21 < ChillerDragon> thanks @heinrich5591

13:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did he leave the discord?
13:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> no
13:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did the bridge pining break then? .-. @milkeeycat
13:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it worked now

14:11 < bridge> <remakepower> hm
14:14 < bridge> <remakepower> I thought we should perhaps add a support for extra resource files which can contain a lot of sound in it at now.
14:26 < bridge> <remakepower> I have been to MMOTEE 2.0 server, and they add some weapon sounds into map. With the power of ```Sv_MapSound```, it quite amazing. But when I opened editor and loaded current map, a lot of map sounds were annoying. Also, that meant that when you enter a new map, you will download the assets of the same map sounds again. Although they are same. If we can add a extra file, it will be more convenient for both of developers and players. And more, w

15:38 < bridge> <kebscs> i think very old issues should get closed in favor of new ones instead
15:39 < bridge> <kebscs> noones scrolling back 5000 issues
15:39 < bridge> <kebscs> noones scrolling back 5000 issues to find them
15:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> It's to preserve history and a good thing imo
15:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> E.g discussions, possibly linked prs etc
15:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> Discussions, possibly linked prs etc
15:49 < bridge> <kebscs> yes new issue can have the old one linked
15:49 < bridge> <kebscs> i mean that with 700 open issues its not possible to find one thats relevant
15:49 < bridge> <kebscs> most are outdated or insufficient info anyway
15:49 < bridge> <kebscs> most are outdated or have insufficient info anyway
15:50 < bridge> <Assa> technically, before opening an issue, you should check if it exists already. It is possible to find relevant ones with a good keyword search
15:50 < bridge> <Assa> you can still cross link issues, that are possibly related, but also describe why your issue is different
15:52 < bridge> <kebscs> by not opening a new issue you dont bring attention to it, and its unknown if that issue is still relevant
15:52 < bridge> <kebscs> and as dev im not searching those 700 find something to code
15:52 < bridge> <kebscs> and as dev im not searching those 700 to find something to code
15:52 < bridge> <Assa> I don't even bring attention to issues, that are new ...
15:53 < bridge> <Assa> and when I do a PR to an issue I wrote a month ago, I get told "this was not discussed"
15:54 < bridge> <Assa> as a dev, you can just check for labels* if done properly. I am fully aware, that not every issue is labled properly, but there are issues with accepting-patches tags
15:55 < bridge> <kebscs> most issues arent labeled
15:55 < bridge> <kebscs> only 10 out of 700 have accepting patches
16:04 < bridge> <Assa> @kebscs any opinion on #10196 ? This would be very simple to implement but needs discussion
16:04 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/10196
16:16 < bridge> <pioooooo> F3 cuz why not
16:19 < bridge> <kebscs> i tried this and its not so simple
16:21 < bridge> <kebscs> most layers dont have color if you base on that, so it looks wrong. you would need to add saving these colors to map file or smth like that
16:21 < bridge> <kebscs> 
16:21 < bridge> <kebscs> text becomes unreadable, you need to contrast its color or add an outline, which looks bad because the textbox is small
16:22 < bridge> <kebscs> also you would need to change how selected layer looks like, like an outline, but theres no space for it
16:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can limit the brightness for the contrast thing
16:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can also just use black or white works for all colors ive tried its "good enough"
16:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can also just use black or white (text) works for all colors ive tried its "good enough"
16:26 < bridge> <Assa> ^ my exact thoughts
16:27 < bridge> <kebscs> if you can make it work then it would be nice
16:27 < bridge> <kebscs> these were just the limitations when i tried it
16:27 < bridge> <Assa> also getting color from a quad layer: first quad color or white
16:27 < bridge> <Assa> getting color for a group: idk, think of something cool, multiplying layers in the group or just by ID
16:27 < bridge> <Assa> also getting color from a quad layer: first quad color or white
16:27 < bridge> <Assa> getting color for a group: idk, think of something cool, multiplying layer colors in the group or just by ID
16:29 < bridge> <Assa> I can also tell you when to use white or black text: calculate grayness and check for threshold, I think it's very good, that this is a very open task where you could do a lot
17:46 < bridge> <robyt3> I think we'd accept patches for most bug-issues with the filter `is:issue state:open label:bug no:assignee -label:incomplete  -label:fix-changes-physics -label:to-reproduce -label:antibot -label:"3rd party"  -label:needs-discussion  -label:meta-discussion -label:macOS -label:Windows -label:Linux -label:steam`, but it's tedious to go through all old issues and update the labels as well.

18:21 < bridge> <Assa> I must admit, the color is sometimes not very promising, as, for a quad for example, the contents may have other colors then the corners

18:21 < bridge> <Assa> (I love this feature anyways xD)
18:36 < bridge> <kebscs> White is default color
18:37 < bridge> <kebscs> So it's white on white
18:37 < bridge> <kebscs> Bit unreadable
19:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why would you color the navigation like that?
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Looks completely shit tbh
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you want to display the layer color, display it inside a small box or smth
19:26 < bridge> <louis> why not let users just choose the color ngl
19:26 < bridge> <louis> out of a preset of like 16 common colors
19:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> material design when?
19:49 < bridge> <robyt3> Turns out the main loop isn't necessary and it's also what was breaking the console rendering for some reason ü´†
20:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i was always under the impression that emscripten had no main loop
20:18 < bridge> <robyt3> Emscripten has https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/emscripten.h.html#c.emscripten_set_main_loop which sets a callback that runs one iteration of the main loop
20:19 < bridge> <robyt3> This seems to be the recommended approach because it allows the browser to render at the pace that it wants
20:20 < bridge> <robyt3> Otherwise SDL does some unholy stack unwinding with ASYNCIFY to call back into Emscripten code in the browsers' main thread when swapping the current frame
20:21 < bridge> <robyt3> But apparently that works better anyway, as otherwise the console rendering and behavior breaks
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah when was this added
20:25 < bridge> <Ewan> im working off 6 yr old info
20:37 < bridge> <robyt3> Should already be older than that AFAICT, for example https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/1875
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> Neat
