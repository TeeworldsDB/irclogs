00:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Alternative would be to make no jump display and only show how many jumps you have in total, and not show how many of them you have used up.
00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Alternative would be to make no jump display and only show how many jumps you have in total, and not show how many of them you have used up. This information is already sent in CNetObj_DDNetCharacter.
00:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that sounds like the easiest solution for now
05:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <watercolours> ddnet doesnt launch after updating to 15.9.1

07:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> your file explorer doesn't support PIE executable.
07:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> - You can either use nightly https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-nightly-linux_x86_64.tar.xz
07:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> - or just start it from terminal for now, next version will fix it
08:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> Is it possible to make a server vote execute a script?
09:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just try it out xd
10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> I tried doing exec script.bat it didn't really work
10:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> is there some way to do it without editing the server code?
10:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Only way I could think of is external tools monitoring the logs if a vote was called
10:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> exec only executes teeworlds Config files
10:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah you mean a system script, thought a tw script xD
10:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the script could connect to the server and execute on vote
10:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (on a specific vote)
10:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> hmm
10:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> but then I need to launch the script and the server?
10:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> maybe I just try to edit the server code
10:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> .bat scripts :monkalaugh:
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> maybe I'll just try to edit the server code
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tater> Idk jupstar said "just try it" I was just testing
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> If effort or complexity is holding you back from editing the code give it a try it‚Äôs not hard

11:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> first is icon font, so also resolution indepentent
11:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Looks nice
11:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> Both of them
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd the 2nd is the current
11:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> First is better
11:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> one like this (static) is even better
11:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> https://media.tenor.com/images/8654397bdc3b7f6bd2551a813d21ad43/tenor.gif
11:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
11:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Not Keks i like it
11:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Not Keks what's the vulkan status? Should we wait  for it for ddnet 16?
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd say its ready for a experimental merge
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just needs windows libs
11:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I wanted to release it, but also wanted to get the tutorial join code in
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> windows libs I need to build?
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i'd download them, wait i wrote everything in the pr
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ok
11:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4687#issuecomment-1036242347
11:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if we dont add the glslangvalidator, we (for now) dont allow building with VS in the CI, bcs it needs the vulkan SDK
11:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno if you want to add executables inside the ddnet-libs, would be kinda strange probs üòÑ
11:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> a bit strange, but they are kind of tools that we need to build, so could argue that it's ok
11:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok, it should also be in the SDK
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Not Keks the sdk vulkan-1.lib is only for x86-64?
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> not sure how .lib files work
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah possible, we only build vulkan support for 64bit anyway
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ok
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> then I'll remove the x86 files
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> seems kind of weird to mix 32bit with modern tech anyway üòÑ
12:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and always makes problems ^^
12:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btw no idea what exactly you have to add for macos, but in worst case we can also disable it for now (moltenvk or smth)
12:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> it didn't add performance there for now, right?
12:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I think disabling is fine, it's only 1% of players and still requires another translation layer
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the problem was that we couldnt even test it
12:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs the FPS were capped
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> right
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> still not fixed: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/issues/1407
12:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Gaming on macOS is such a niche anyway, it's fine to focus on Windows and Linux
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sdl2 will probably remove old mouse mode
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah üòÑ
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> which we are still using?
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no but there is a option
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we dont use it, but have an option for it
12:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to enable it
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, if they do remove that we might have some trouble as iirc there are a few good players that use it
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bad for them xd
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Might have to just stop updating sdl2
12:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye bad f or them xd
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im against not updating
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they can get used to it
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Old mouse mode look shit anyway:pepeH:
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Clearly the only solution is for us to fork sdl2 and maintain it ourselves üòÑ
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah we cannot do that, there are potential security problems
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They can but they won't, Konsti sticks to ddnet 9 ffs
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then just ignore him
12:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah sdl2 and opengl and soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è vulkan, that always make problem for us xD
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> VK atleast gives them bigger numbers, which is always better
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> konsti will find a  way to say vulkan sucks
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> You can always ask around how many people are actually using that setting
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> konsti is on linux
12:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think he will  be fine üòÑ
12:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to spend like an hour fixing some small issues yesterday, instead I spent an hour trying to get it compiling on macOS again :/
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> on vm it works quite ez
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> since macos has a packet manager xd
12:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm considering just reinstalling macOS at this point rather than trying massage cmake into working properly with my dual sdk environment and give up on testing the official release sdk level
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (the worst package manager ever designed, but yeah it does atleast have one)
12:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ^^
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you hear windows also got one btw?
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> windows store or what xd
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think there is conan, some python packet manager, and cross plattform
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its used by a few projects
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> winget
12:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its annoying, but it works xd
12:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's for actual applications even. You can do `winget install spotify` and it just works üòõ
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice ^^
12:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They still use the same normal underlying installer, so it's not perfect, can't track files and which package they belong to, but it's still an improvement imo
12:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> pylint looks into ddnet-libs
12:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can somebody help xd
12:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> sure, I'll add an exclude
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> #4747 is the one you want to include in ddnet16?
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4747
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldrun> what about [chocolatey]("https://chocolatey.org")?
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldrun> what about [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Haven't actually used it. Only heard of it
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldrun> packages are not up to date, i have the impression
13:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it any good in your experience? Does it differ from winget as in maybe actually managing the filesystem fallout of the installers?
13:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldrun> Didn't use it, since it's not a comparison to eg `pacman` where you have all thepackages. It just does not cover enough and is not maintained with up to date packages. But I didn't really use it. Seems to work for some people. I just go on ddnet.tw download the folder and start the exe out of it ^^
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i used choco
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but only to install python
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and nodejs
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldrun> it has teeworlds i think, but not ddnet
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> winget is on windows 11 right
13:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i refuse to use a OS that puts ads in a file browser
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-accidentally-reveals-ads-may-be-coming-to-the-windows-11-file-explorer/
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> All these options seem to lack what I like about most linux pkg managers. They don't manage the filesystem, they don't provide a coherent set (they don't bother with dependencies at all), and they don't bother with updates being shipped through that channel at all
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i only use windows for gaming anyway
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows filesystem sux anyway
13:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are mostly cli interfaces to download and run an installer
14:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <coldrun> Windows can be fun, at least I am trying this out atm: https://github.com/Awesome-Windows/Awesome#productivity
14:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> some msvc specialist here?
14:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the CI outputs very useful information:
14:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> `Error copying file "D:/a/ddnet/ddnet/release/data/shader/vulkan/prim.frag.spv" to "pack_DDNet-15.9.1-win64_zip/DDNet-15.9.1-win64/data/shader/vulkan/prim.frag.spv".`
14:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no info why it happens or anything, and linux also works xd
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe bcs it wants backslashes xd
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> D:\\
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah yes, "Error" is my favourite
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you give me any more details about it? No, just "Error"
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats the point
14:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont get anything xd
14:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know, not your fault, it's windows just being useless
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> guess i have to switch to windows xd
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ci is just too slow
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> source file not found xd
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> could have added that information xd
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yes
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> who ever changed how tune zones are predicted 
16:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> i hate you
16:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they are predicted in first place now xd
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> bad
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> you should explain why
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> else the developer who did it doesnt know what u want
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> but why do i have to see what happens in the tuned area if im not in it ?
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> doesnt that make sense? XD
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just bcs u arent in, doesnt mean the entity isnt in it
16:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Sorah> ye i know  =P well its not that important anyway  it only ruined a little thing for me thats all
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok^^
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> font awesome even has a rust icon xd
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/954801006498160730/unknown.png
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why wouldnt it
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt it have python cpp etc
19:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cpp not
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess cuz cpp doesnt have a oficial logo
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg
19:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think its oficial
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Logo endorsed by Standard C++"
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> iso sounds pretty official to me xd
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm well
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its just endorsed
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by a standard
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> python has the python foundation
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust has the rust foundation
19:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> defs impresive how much shit they have xD
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> could almost make a game just with all these logos
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> C++ has wg21 and ISO üòõ
