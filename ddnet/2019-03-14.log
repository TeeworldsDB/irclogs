16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <triki> If i use vpn, all good
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if it works with vpn but not without it is not a ddos problem on ddnet side
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> i guess he meant
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> the ddos protection thing
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> or isn't this a thing?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it is
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum I only know d,g,e&q
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> damn i fell for the old strg+shift+q trick
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sad> does anyone know how to change the resolution of teeworlds 0.7.2 under macos/linux? It always resets to the default max. resolution (see https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/921) even if I change it to something different. It does not matter if I do that in teeworlds or by overwriting the parameters in the settings.cfg (the one accessed through the directory in $USERDIR  <message clipped>
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sad> any suggestions?
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Sad did u ask on tw discord
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try disabling fullscreen and borderless window
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and try another window manager
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it might be that TW is requesting a small window but the WM is providing it a larger window and then TW uses that
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for example in a tiling WM set TW to be floating
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sad> thank you
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sad> disabling fullscreen and borderless window didnt work - now on to trying a new WM
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what wm do you use btw?
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sad> a TWM called magnet on top of the default osx
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ha, tiling!
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I guessed right
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sad> true but even when its not running, the same problem occurs :/
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sad> "The fullscreen resolution on mac osx is restricted to the desktop resolution. There used to be a bug in sdl when using sth else - i think the game freezes when tabbing out and then back in. Dunno if that's fixed yet." -oy

19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sad> I'll try this one soon then
