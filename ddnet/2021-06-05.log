07:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> @Jupstar âœª how hard would it be to make picture in picture for dummy :justatest:
10:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie I'd guess extremely given our graphicw stack but @Jupstar âœª would know better
10:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> :justatest: that's what i have thought, but i'm just hoping the master can give me some light
10:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> does any arch user here has an easy way to run the proper clang format version for ddnet codebase?
10:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> chillderdragon: get the package `clang-format-static-bin` from the AUR, use `/opt/clang-format-static/clang-format-11` (I think you need to do `-i <files>`)
10:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> chillerdragon: ah, `clang-format-10` instead of 11 i think
11:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/47d63317aac0c84f540f379686925a17af6fadbf/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L1369
11:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> why are we checking four directions for GameTile, but only three directions for Front?
12:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> chillerdragon
12:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> a
12:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> chillerdraogn:
12:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> chillerdragon:
12:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon
12:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> how do i tag a matrix user
12:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> clickable like dotqw here
12:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <dotqw> i get pinged, mb u just need to type username
12:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I know, but you name was clickable when chiller pinged you

12:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Patiga\:  yea i found that too and thought it might be useful but the py script will use the clang-format then i guess
14:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> You mean like a split screen!?
14:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> or that
14:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Split screen should be ok
14:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> What else did you mean?
14:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> picture in picture, a small window in the corner showing dummies view
14:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Ah yeah
14:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I think that's not too hard
14:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> U can abuse glviewport and just render the scene twice
14:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i thought about smth like that just for a teammate instead of dummy ðŸ˜„
14:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @TsFreddie
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/850720104386789406/test.mp4
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it still doesnt render from dummy view
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> bruh
14:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i guess this is about what u want
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i can upload the code and u can mess around with all the bugs when changing g_Config.m_ClDummy xD
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs i dunno why it just resets the value to my main for no reason xD
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ðŸ‘€ is it possible to get rid of hud in PiP tho
15:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well yeah, u probs need to code a bit
15:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> like a client state Client()->IsPiP();
15:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or u just completly ignore most components
15:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u just need player, particles etc
15:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no UI and stuff
15:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> also  i think the hud needs to be on top of PiP too.
15:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/commit/fdbde176f67696bcb210ae7d23701029d0dd950f
15:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> good luck ðŸ˜›
15:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> OMG HOW NICE
15:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i was thinking about trying to add split screen to my client but did not think it was feasable for me
15:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> is it coming to ddnet client? o.O
15:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Patiga\:  ah nice nvm the script also checks the clang-format-10 binary very nice
15:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yay local style checks
15:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probs not abusable and thus nobody noticed? i cant read that code, but looks wrong yeah xd
15:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, probs not, as its not really useful to see ur dummy xd
15:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but u can always open an issue and see what other devs say
15:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> probably not many maps are using death tile in front layer.
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but in theory it might give a smaller hitbox
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as the tee is a circle isnt it
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> ye
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then i'd open an issue for sure
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> like it'll have a smaller hitbox on one side
15:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
16:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @TsFreddie
16:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/850737766777356338/unknown.png
16:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd
16:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> lol
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> Oh I tried to reproduce in the top left corner
19:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://blog.cloudflare.com/quic-version-1-is-live-on-cloudflare/
19:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> QUIC and HTTP/3
19:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (HTTP/3 uses QUIC)
19:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > For instance, it could work great for online games. You don't have to choose between the low dev cost of TCP and the low latency of UDP. Just use the streams for control and datagrams for real-time communications, all inside the same tunnel.
19:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cool
19:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw cloudflare uses rust for this :greenthing:
19:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heinrich has been wanting to make teeworlds QUIC for a while now ðŸ˜›
19:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i guess tw wouldnt profit from that retransmission, would it?, if its too late to the party it could also be dropped
19:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> quic for 2d quake game 2021
19:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> being IPv6-ready would be even more impressive than using QUIC as the transport protocol ðŸ™‚

19:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
19:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hope its true
19:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > It was reported this week that an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft had paid zero corporation tax on $315bn (Â£222bn) profit last year because it was resident in Bermuda for tax purposes.
19:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats just m$$
19:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Firstly, the G7 want a global minimum tax rate so as to avoid a "race to the bottom" where countries can undercut each other with low tax rates.
19:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
19:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Secondly, the rules will aim to make companies pay tax in the countries where they are selling their products or services, rather than wherever they end up declaring their profits.
23:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> @Jupstar âœª i had the same bug from #bugs when i was mwssing around with negative mouse distance settings https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/757720336274948198/822199016665776189
23:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> im typing here cuz im muted
23:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> usually it happened when cursor was outside my screen and then teleported fast to some other place i believe
