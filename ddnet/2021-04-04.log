16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Surprised they paid the guy
17:36 <+ChillerDragon> oh thats a nice end
17:36 <+ChillerDragon> it was the guy with his blog right?
17:37 <@deen> yes
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1617557814.png
17:37 <+ChillerDragon> omg trash site
17:47 <@deen> welcome to the internet
17:47 <@deen> you must be new here
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> People like you almost make me wish we just lived in an orvellian dystopia...
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They let you opt out of tracking and you are annoyed
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If even us computer people can't appreciate the freedoms gdpr gave us, might aswell give up all our privacy right now
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> well to be fair this site is not really gdpr compliant since opting out of everything is hidden behind many more clicks than opting in (if i recall the gdpr stuff correctly)
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> > It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/ 7-3
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> not surprising considering he's talking behind irc...
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga definitely, but I'll take a step in the correct direction
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its badly done
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should have a clear no button
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 btw even opting out they still track u
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> heck they prob dont even know that simply by using google fonts link they can alreayd track u
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, I'll give them a call so they can revert it to the default track without asking behaviour
19:29 <+ChillerDragon> there are less annoying cookie banners like the github one
19:29 <+ChillerDragon> one that lets you use the site without having to bother with cookies 
19:29 <+ChillerDragon> its just not very estetic
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> deen: you are right i do not browse the internet :) i stay in my bubble of sites that are not annoying me
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> im sure your isp still have ftp server for it's users
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 they probably paid him cuz he is fame through is nice blog and now they want to motivate an army of devs to do the same. And if they do not make enough noise nobody will notice they stay unpaid. And then rockstar goes stonks on volunteer contributions while staying closed src.
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> also fair :)
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 https://secret.club/2021/04/03/runescape-heuristics.html
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tldr send network packets and dont use the mouse
22:21 <+ChillerDragon> good read thanks for sharing @Ryozuki
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> any single command to return old scoreboard with no time
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ?
