16:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> weird. i've seen two reviews on steam asking for refund, and i have one contacted me for refund.
16:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> correction: the one contacted me was asking me about why he can't get a refund, not that he expected me to refund him.
16:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> i told him the game is free and he just left.
16:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> i'm confused
16:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sounds like they are the confused ones
16:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> we don't distribute steam key anywhere right? like you haven't generated any (if that is even doable for free game)
16:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :kek:
16:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have distributed 5 keys per reviewer when inviting them to review DDNet
16:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but only 2-3 even used them
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I want my money back !
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Sounds like a stonks strategy asking for refund on free software \:D
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and the rest makes big cash now xd
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> original unused ddnet steam key - 10k$
16:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> imagine being scammed into buying free games on tiktok.
16:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> were they?
16:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> not ours. but i remember it beong a thing
17:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ts懒散> being*
17:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> internet should be USK 25
