00:10 < Henningstone> Is there a way in the ddnet client's code how to determine whether I have crossed the start line of a race?
00:43 <@heinrich5991> you can check whether you have a race timer
00:44 < necropotame> Henningstone, check if the warm-up timer is negative
00:44 < Henningstone> that would require the latest commits I suppose?
00:45 < Henningstone> (@heinrich)
00:45 < Henningstone> necropotame: this is only the case on the latest ddnet server, right? Or also on old ones?
00:47 < necropotame> The warm-up timer is clamped on all clients, except recent DDNet client, where the negative part is used to send the racetime
00:47 < necropotame> To be compke
00:47 < necropotame> To be complete, you should check also if the game object has the FaceTime Flag
00:47 < Henningstone> I was talking about whether checking for a negative warmup timer would also work on, let's say, DDNet 9.x servers
00:48 < necropotame> (or maybe you just have to check this flag indeed)
00:48 < necropotame> No
00:49 < Henningstone> hmm how unfortunate, since there are still so many out-of-date servers online that'd be quite unreliable then... But thanks anyway!
00:50 < necropotame> That's the downside of trying to have moving freeze :)
00:50 < Henningstone> if you ask me this shouldn't have gone into official ddnet, but whatever...
00:55 <@heinrich5991> why? :)
00:57 < Henningstone> because of the massive inconveniences for players aswell as developers that have been introduced by these rather big changes
00:57 <@heinrich5991> the timer has moved in the internal representation
00:58 <@heinrich5991> that's maybe a hassle for devs, but not for players
00:58 <@heinrich5991> Henningstone: it seems the ddnet client checks whether it has hit start tiles to determine when to start the autorecorded race demo
01:01 < Henningstone> The race demo recorder does this check, but the result isn't being saved anywhere and I was too lazy now to do that and it would have been hacky anyway...
01:02 < Henningstone> Somewhen I'm gonna get necros commits and then I can use the new system anyway

18:18 <@deen> Ryozuki: mistakes in map release
18:19 <@deen> IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'maps/run_inTheHell.msgpack'
18:19 <@deen> and you forgot to add the map file so the first line in releases is wrong
18:25 <@heinrich5991> deen: hmh wrote something about cleaning up the maps
18:25 <@heinrich5991> maybe he's the one responsible? ^^
18:35 < Ryozuki> deen, https://ddnet.tw/releases/ ? i think i didn't released that
18:35 <@deen> ok
18:36 <@deen> skype is broken for me, so someone inform HMH
18:37 < Ryozuki> told him
19:43 < Fin> Good morning. Is there someone who can tell me how to just print the dns servers ip in my linux shell? Rechereche isn't working for me :(
19:44 < laxadedi> Fin: cat /etc/resolv.conf
19:45 < Fin> ah thanks laxadedi, I think the rest is possible with grep and cut
19:58 < Fin> cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | cut -c 12-26 this solution :D
20:06 <@deen> Fin: not a generic solution, there can be spaces, etc
22:34 < CookieMichal> Hello, does anyone have solution files for VS15 for ddnet? 
22:34  * CookieMichal slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
22:34 < Ryozuki> You can actually use visual studio 2017
22:34 < Ryozuki> it has support for cmake
22:35 < Ryozuki> so you load vs2017
22:35 < Ryozuki> then file -> open folder
22:35 < Ryozuki> and then open ddnet folder
22:36 < Henningstone> can't cmake create files for VS 2015, too?
22:36 < CookieMichal> Thanks, will try
22:37 < Ryozuki> for building yes
22:37 < Ryozuki> but for developing vs2017 is way better
22:37 < Ryozuki> CookieMichal, check this https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/12/20/cmake-support-in-visual-studio-2017-whats-new-in-the-rc-update/
22:38 < CookieMichal> Heard about it, just didn't think of
22:38 < CookieMichal> updating vs
22:38 < Ryozuki> so, you actually don't need a solution
22:38 < Ryozuki> just open the ddnet folder
22:41 < Ryozuki> http://image.prntscr.com/image/8ff034b39a0c4299b9316a9793ffaeb4.png
22:41 < Ryozuki> :)
22:43 < CookieMichal> nice :)
22:43 < CookieMichal> thanks for help :)
22:58 < necropotame> There is any reasons for keeping bam?
22:59 < Henningstone> yes there is!
22:59 <@deen> necropotame: everyone who compiles tw has bam already, but not necessarily cmake
22:59 <@deen> only reason i can think of
23:00 < necropotame> Henningstone?
23:00 < Henningstone> I still prefer bam for teeworlds because it's more handy in a way
23:01 < Henningstone> and it just simply works
23:01 < necropotame> Well, it's not really an argument
23:02 < Henningstone> the argument is a personal preference, nothing more
23:02 < Henningstone> but that should somehow count, too
23:02 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: no macos support in cmake yet :)
23:02 <@heinrich5991> Henningstone: you can use ninja as a generator. it seems similar to bam
23:02 < necropotame> Ah, this is an argument ^^
23:04 < necropotame> heinrich5991, did you test the TeeUniverse map that I gave you?
23:04 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:05 < necropotame> Ok. (Just to know if I need to send it again :) )
