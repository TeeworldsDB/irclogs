01:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> Lol. I been on ESR for a long time for reasons like this
01:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> what's ESR
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> Everytime they make an update my user chrome.css breaks :(
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> Extended support release
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ahhhh
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i use the normal release but maybe ill try dev firefox
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> honestly they added a lot of what used to be dev-only to normal firefox
01:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so i havent needed it
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> Ur on arch right
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> U can be a cool kid and use surf
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> nop
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> win10 :(
01:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> Ooo
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i will definitely switch if i never have to touch an adobe product again
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> which is maybe never
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> I'm glad I switched back to osx Im too dumb for wsl
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> O ya I forgot to send u that
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i use XD at work
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> Do u still need ?
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so i cant just switch easily
01:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean i could use a windows emulator
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but that sounds nasty
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> I meant the ps crack
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> Oo idk that
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> also there are DirectX games that i play with shitty wine performance
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> crying
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> :(
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ever heard of gocco of war
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> My friend says ps runs great in wine
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> Naw wassat
01:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> https://store.steampowered.com/app/346730/GOCCO_OF_WAR/
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it looks lame
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and like maplestory 3
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> but it's not
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> one of my favorite games to just fuck around in
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> people say on linux it's fine but it never worked for me
01:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> i could barely even get the steam app to work on linux
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> and steam is a REQUIREMENT for networking in that game
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> Damn crazy
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> What's the name of the thing everyone uses for games on linux
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ill dm you instead of here but if it's on sale you guys should get it
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it's not worth 20
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> uhh proton i think?
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> Ya I think so
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <tela> And oki
02:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <PopCorn181> Have you ever thought of adding a /rewind for /practice?
02:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Way too much data to save
08:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like living on the edge
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/mvn0rb/opening_a_website_with_special_characters_makes/
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mom im famous
12:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> nice
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://www.dealabs.com/bons-plans/certification-gitlab-learn-gratuite-2138418?utm_campaign=2021-04-22&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> French but the certification is in english (translate the website)
13:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> free instead of 650$
16:00 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> eww lofi Ryozuki
18:18 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> Does one know what is running on this ip or who owns it? 37.59.55.192 is it a master server?
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i'm not sure if people will be able to tell just by an ip
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> if its some ip thats pinging ur server every so often it might be one of those status.tw crawlers
18:22 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> its spamming my client not server xd
18:24 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> lmao 13x37 is still a thing?
18:25 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> 37.59.55.192:9408 it says Blockworlds by 13x37 in /info :D
18:31 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i guess its a meme isnt it @ReiTW?
18:35 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ah cool now i know why it was spamming me :D its renaming the server in the browser looks kinda cool
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <becc> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/834846863332343828/Screenshot_20210422_194244_com.android.chrome.png
19:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <becc> What is it used for?
19:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <becc> (data files -> _data_sizes which only exist in version 4)
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @stnwtr it's the size of the data after decompression
19:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what are you building? üôÇ
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <becc> So it's not containing important map data, right?
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <becc> Just want to play around with maps and teeworlsd in general :d
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, you kinda need it if you want to decompress the data
20:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but for the game at the end, you don't need it
20:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <becc> Is this the only difference between 3 and 4?
20:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <becc> And whats new in vanilla 0.7.x Datafiles?
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they still use version 4 @stnwtr
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://zellij.dev/news/beta/
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <becc> Oh, my fault
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <becc> I loaded the map which came with ddnet-client using teeworlds 0.7
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> looks nice

23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/834898881099071508/Screenshot_20210423-050913__01.jpg
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> did a thing:kek:
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie I did the same thing üòõ
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ü§ù
23:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> much much better idea but you need to figure out a nice way to do shallow CoW copies of gameworlds or people can lag the game by switching teams
23:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Why do I need to copy gameworlds tho
23:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't you want distinct gameworlds per team?
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> But I just cached gamecontroller's onentity calls and planned to construct new gameworld across multiple frames
23:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> If a team is created
23:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> multiple frames -> multiple ticks
23:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> So basically I don't need them to be synced, so I just create new ones from scratch instead of trying to make a identical one with team 0
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I wanted to allow each team to have a different game mode even. :justatest:
23:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> making ddnet src mode-agnostic is a plus imo
23:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm multiple ticks would work
23:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Also teehistorian and demobuilder is probably straight up broken with this many gamecontrollers kekw
23:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> But I'd like it to be playable first at least
