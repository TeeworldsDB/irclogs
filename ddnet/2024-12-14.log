06:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ddnet.org is officially banned by tencent
06:10 < bridge> <tsfreddie> rip
06:31 < bridge> <totar> does it say why?
07:49 < bridge> <tsfreddie> no
09:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> They're going to make their own game about Kirby with gun
09:12 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> pew pew
09:17 < bridge> <Solly> Yayyyyyyy );
11:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> :cat_woah:  go such an easy lang, @learath2 i now understand what you meant with quick and messy :kek:

11:47 < bridge> <learath2> It looks like C, but it has the development speed of Python
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but why does the compiler not give me any feedback during compiling xd
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that is just such a weird design
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you just sit there and wait without knowing what's happening
12:19 < bridge> <learath2> The go compiler? Yeah, I wish I could make it verbose somehow
12:19 < bridge> <learath2> Noooo, it was a good run
12:21 < bridge> <tsfreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848>
12:23 < bridge> <patiga> aw
12:23 < bridge> <patiga> ia there a way to figure out why?
12:27 < bridge> <learath2> Too much traffic, no web loicense?
12:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> shows taiwan too
12:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> doesn't really matter tho
12:47 < bridge> <tsfreddie> tencent blocks pretty much everything
12:48 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it's just harder for people to click on ddnet links in their apps
12:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @learath2 im also yoinking rust's `impl` blocks
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what about master servers?
12:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> tencent is not china btw
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but do they provide internet access?
12:53 < bridge> <tsfreddie> no
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so you can simply not open the url
12:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> in their apps
12:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> you can copy them to a browser
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and they work with a deny list?
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or are all urls blocked by default
12:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> deny list
12:54 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it works with reports i think so we got reported
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so there was a employee of tencent that actively blocked it? wtf xD
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah k
12:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> could be automatic tho
12:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it was fine until someone pasted ddnet.org/status
12:55 < bridge> <tsfreddie> which have the taiwan keyword in it
13:09 < bridge> <learath2> I knew we should be using Chinese Taipei
14:38 < bridge> <pioooooo> Taipei is a city of Taiwan
14:39 < bridge> <pioooooo> But not Taiwan
14:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> so why does tencent impact ddnet? do they host the firewall or what's the impact?
15:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no they just block the url in their own apps
15:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> so it's preventing the "spreading" of ddnet but nit exactly the direct access.
15:14 < bridge> <reitw> what a shit company tencent
15:38 < bridge> <learath2> Chinese Taipei is the term used by some international organizations for the entirety of the island to keep glorious China happy
16:23 < bridge> <tsfreddie> it doesn't really, just annoying to share map info and server info directly in the chat.

16:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> have we figured this out?
16:27 < bridge> <tsfreddie> i've seen the first one twice i think.
16:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 144Hz? Looks more like 1Hz :troll:
17:39 < bridge> <r1ger_r1> guys urgently!!! what is name of this map???
17:39 < bridge> <r1ger_r1> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1317531337338654811/image.png?ex=675f062d&is=675db4ad&hm=92a7e01c854ec6da1e80913494f4fb2e090277193b8d27326e2812f510c0e121&
17:39 < bridge> <r1ger_r1> pls
17:41 < bridge> <bumm.> Tutorial
17:41 < bridge> <r1ger_r1> are u shur?
17:42 < bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~Activate Windows~~
17:42 < bridge> <bumm.> Yes, wrong channel btw better ask in #questions next time
17:52 < bridge> <r1ger_r1> sorry
18:09 < bridge> <woidless> Can I slow down the timer speed in ddnet
18:11 < bridge> <pathos3005> Are you talking about the DDNet server tick rate?
18:15 < bridge> <pathos3005> ChillerDragon Give me mod also on the solo save server pls, bots not getting kicked, actual players getting kicked
18:25 < bridge> <woidless> I want to slow down the timer that starts when you touch the start and ends when you touch the finish
18:25 < bridge> <woidless> Which is also on top of the screens in the middle when you are on the server
18:26 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> why would you want that?
18:27 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> To match with slowdown tunes I guess
18:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> So you know how long you would've taken in real time
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> You can't in an easy way, time is counted in ticks and ticks happen 50 timea a second
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> You can't in an easy way, time is counted in ticks and ticks happen 50 times a second
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> You can maybe fake it by sending fake values for the rount timer
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> You can maybe fake it by sending fake values for the round timer
18:31 < bridge> <learath2> You'll have to experiment a lot. This isn't something that someone has already figured out. Maybe you can beg ChillerDragon to figure it out for you
18:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Should be relatively easy ™️
18:53 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, as long as the round timer isn't wired up to any other logic it will be simple-ish
19:06 < bridge> <triki> guys can u say me how i can add to pool /map in maps folder C:\Users\rust-\AppData\Roaming\DDNet\maps on my own server?
19:32 < bridge> <robyt3> Add entries for the maps to the `record_maps` table in the sqlite database `ddnet-server.sqlite`  in the config directory
20:08 < bridge> <pioooooo> new to know for me;;;
20:09 < bridge> <learath2> It started after the Nagoya Resolution. When China objected to Republic of China competing in the olympics they eventually reached a compromise where they would be allowed to compete under the name Chinese Taipei
20:20 < bridge> <pioooooo> Politics
20:36 < bridge> <triki> can u plz write shord guide cus idk for what i need start this
20:38 < bridge> <triki> can u plz write shorе guide cus idk for what i need start this
21:33 < bridge> <robyt3> Install sqlite (https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) then use `sqlite3 ddnet-server.sqlite` in a terminal to open the database. Use `INSERT INTO` to add the entries to the `record_race` table. For example `INSERT INTO record_maps (Map, Server, Mapper, Points, Stars) VALUES('map name', 'none', 'mapper', 0, 0);`
21:34 < bridge> <zwelf2> Also if you want ddnet maps:

21:38 < bridge> <triki> ok i did it and with C:\Users\rust-\AppData\Roaming\DDNet\maps its work fine
21:38 < bridge> <triki> but with C:\Users\rust-\AppData\Roaming\DDNet\maps\types\novice\maps its didnt work(
21:38 < bridge> <triki> idk how to correct add to parth here `add_path $USERDIR/maps` in storage.cfg
21:38 < bridge> <triki> ok i did it and with `C:\Users\rust-\AppData\Roaming\DDNet\maps` its work fine
21:38 < bridge> <triki> but with `C:\Users\rust-\AppData\Roaming\DDNet\maps\types\novice\maps` its didnt work(
21:38 < bridge> <triki> idk how to correct add to parth here `add_path $USERDIR/maps` in storage.cfg
21:39 < bridge> <triki> can u plz write short guide cus idk for what i need start this
21:54 < bridge> <robyt3> Try adding this to your `storage.cfg`:
21:54 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
21:54 < bridge> <robyt3> add_path C:/path/to/the/ddnet-maps/types/solo
21:55 < bridge> <robyt3> add_path C:/path/to/the/ddnet-maps/types/novice
21:55 < bridge> <robyt3> add_path C:/path/to/the/ddnet-maps/types/moderate
21:55 < bridge> <robyt3> ...
21:55 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
21:58 < bridge> <triki> zzzzz its stupid  but it works not actual go to folder with maps. thanks
22:08 < bridge> <triki> zzzzz its stupid  but it works, its weird cus not actual go to folder with maps. thanks
22:09 < bridge> <triki> i find smth interesting
