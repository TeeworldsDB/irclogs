16:54 <@deen> Yay, ddnet.tw works again with fritzbox 7390 on wifi, update out today
16:55 <@deen> anyone know any google employees who would like to vouch for Nim so we get selected for GSoC? Want to be a mentor at least, if I never was a student :P
16:58 < laxa> I know at least one google employee
16:58 < laxa> I have him on facebook
16:58 < laxa> he did same school as me, and he is working in USA now
16:59 < laxa> wait deen, I'll find for you his github profile, then maybe you can contact him
17:00 < laxa> https://github.com/bombela
17:17 <@deen> You tell him that Nim is great and to come on our irc channel and vouch for us :P
17:23 <@EastByte> great plan :)
17:24 <@deen> haha
17:24 <@EastByte> deen: do you think nim will play an important role in the future?
17:24 <@deen> important role for what or whom?
17:24 <@EastByte> general development
17:24 <@EastByte> too general?
17:24 <@deen> it has the potential to, i believe
17:24 <@deen> but i don't know how it will develop
17:25 <@EastByte> I hope it will
17:25 <@deen> why?
17:25 <@EastByte> because it's really fun to write in and I need a reason to continue using it instead of other langs
17:26 <@deen> get people excited about the language, improve it, become a gsoc student for nim
17:26 <@deen> I posted another nim blogpost yesterday, funnily I'm menitioned in it^^
17:27 <@EastByte> never heard of gsoc before (google summer of code?)
17:27 <@deen> s/blogpost/article
17:27 <@deen> yes
17:27 <@EastByte> :)
17:27 <@deen> basically you program on a specific part of the project
17:27 <@deen> and get 5500 $ from google in return
17:27 <@EastByte> :D

17:30 <@deen> also, the nim mentor from last year is a student this year, haha
17:30 <@deen> (nim didn't get accepted last year anyway)
17:35 <@deen> the ideas weren't bad i think: https://github.com/Araq/Nim/wiki/GSoC-2014-Ideas
17:36 <@deen> fun stuff like a code generator for opencl
17:39 <@EastByte> quite a few

22:26 < eeeee> never done gsoc as my uni had too many exams in the summer
22:26 < eeeee> but sounds like teh shit
22:38 <@deen> i always felt like doing other stuff in the summer
22:39 < eeeee> like what?
22:40 <@deen> bicycling and sitting at the lake all day instead of going to university
22:41 <@deen> I didn't go to any classes at all in some summer semesters, haha
22:45 < eeeee> nice
22:47 < eeeee> i actually had to study a bit because the classes were pretty hardcore, and in russia if you don't pass the exams and get kicked out of university you'd likely get drafted into the army
