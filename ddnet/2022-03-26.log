00:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> does anyone know the max offsets for eyes when moving cursor and stuff
00:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> or maybe just point me in the right direction, maybe link to actual tw code on github
04:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Arenâ€™t the eyes always at the same offset? Or do you mean the cursor offset to the tee? There is a Config I think default is 400
05:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> imagine you *could* change the eye offset
05:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> so that when you set it to 0 they'd all be staring into your souls

06:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lol
07:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> they are not in 0.6
11:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wait heinrich connected
11:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> damn
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wow firefox's performance really sucks compared to chrome
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tested back in time 3 on the map renderer, chrome runs really smooth and firefox completly dies xd
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> on chrome it runs smoother than the one of ddnet.tw too,
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that always rebuilds all buffers when zooming, and since back in time 3 is huge, that costs alot of time
12:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadge
12:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> even brave is lacking a bit compared to chrome
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new record?
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pog

17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Not Keks demo converted into mp4 are also like the screenshot taken ingame, completely aside
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957314039673937920/deepdrag_2022-03-26_17-20-27.demo.mp4
17:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> screen flickers doesn't appear in the video though
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but with intel it works right?
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (screenshot or viedeo rednering) doesnt matter, same code
17:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> what do you mean intel?
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u tried an intel yesterday
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> this is nvidia gpu, win 7
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yesterday evening was same pc, nvidia gpu
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i know this is ur gt 740m
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> it is
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u said u have an intel didnt u
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> on work laptop yes, but vulkan crashes
17:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> no adequate device found
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> this is the issue i posted on github
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> its also an old laptop ^^
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah ok
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the problem is really i dunno what i can do to test if this is a code bug
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the only other person with screenshot problems was someone with intel hd 630
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and the trashy intel hd 550 tablet worked without problems xd
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont really have any other intel device and no old nvidia gpu
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> gtx 760 worked without problems
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats the oldest i got
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> is there a list of hardware stats from steam?
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> to me it kinda looks like a weird alignment issue
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that a pixel is always skipped or smth xd
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> RGB vs RGBA maybe
17:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but RGB is really unlikely
17:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what processor u know likes 3 byte alignments xd
17:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there are stats of used hardware yes, but i dunno if ddnet has such stats
17:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> 8-bit processors don't care ðŸ˜„
17:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean gpu can also read 1 byte alignment, thats not the problem
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its more about performance
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> reading 3 bytes, means 3 times 1 byte
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or "overread" by 1 byte and do checks
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> no, you read 4 bytes and mask
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but thats still slow, u need to know the offset
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> requires additional computing
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> or you do 2+1 or 1+2
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and GPU cores are slow
17:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> cant get full log, it doesn't appear in the logfile, only console window
17:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/957317243836968980/message.txt
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah i doubt its ffmpeg
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well gtx 760 is also kepler, it has a newer driver tho
17:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and i only tested on win10, tho this probs unrelated since its inside the driver
17:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Chairn flashy screen u said?
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2-Vulkan/issues/62
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2-Vulkan/issues/1
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> seems like dota2 also had issues with nvidia kepler in particular
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> maybe win10 has a newer driver inbuilt which fixes it
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that would explain why GPUInfo.org lists gt740m with newer drivers
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah no flash, i used the wrong word
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> its shaky
17:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> The cursor offset
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Alexander> Also 400 what
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh ok, honestly no idea what we can do to test, live linux USB stick?
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u install win10 xdd
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or gotta live with that, since not reproducable
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i'll live with that
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> does virtualbox supports gpu virtualization?
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont think any has vulkan support if thats u question
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but there are vm with gpu acceleration
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> vmware has like opengl 4.6 or smth
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> qemu > anything else
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but qemu's gpu acceleration also sucks xd
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> qemu has various video drivers
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah tested most of them
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i bet google with stadia has nice support, when release google?
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyway qemu is open source
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its instantly a better option
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah i also use it most of the time xdd
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use qemu to test ryo-os
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with a serial port in qemu
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can print stuff on the host
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> QEMU is not a full virtualization i think, like it performs DBT before running on the host
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> qemu can use kvm
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my guess is that if the host and guest cpu arch match it can use it
18:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk im no expert
