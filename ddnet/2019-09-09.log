07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> my ddnet had a bug where i pasted a thing with a linebreak
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and the next message i tried to send was on the next line down in chat
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> idk if its fixed in newest version

08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe related @noby
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yo, I have a vector of a struct that contains two vars. how can I sort the vector based on one of the vars' value inside of them?
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (the one var inside is an int)
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I have tried my best for the last couple hours, but i cant do it correctly. some tries have each entry twice, some have entries missing, I found nothing that helped me on the internet :(
