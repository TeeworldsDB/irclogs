07:55 < bridge> <Ewan> morning :feelsbadman:
08:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ‚òï
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u know why microcontrollers like arduino and others use USB-B and mini USB-B so much?
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> or its that they are older models
11:07 < bridge> <learath2> I would guess a combination of designs being old and microcontrollers not needing the fancy features of usbc
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit/
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is a new rust embedded book
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> the previous one used a F3 which i have
11:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> time to buy a microbit
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw im sad about the raspberry state
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> its like its no longer a cheap option
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> its out of stock everywhere
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> and min 70‚Ç¨
11:08 < bridge> <learath2> Probably also costs more to have a usb type c port now that I think about it
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got a aquarium and wanted to tinker a bit with a PH sensor
11:09 < bridge> <learath2> Damn. I remember getting mine for like 25-30‚Ç¨
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah same
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont have it anymore
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i think RPI is now scalped
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> or idk
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw do u buy electronics? and where do u buy them?
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> the best local store here is https://www.mouser.es/
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> its cheaper if u buy in bulk often tho
11:12 < bridge> <_vozdyx> Can I write to this channel?
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont ask me why i got so many resistors
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1166665659506233364/1972e818-84b8-470d-8afb-41974b011533.png?ex=654b5110&is=6538dc10&hm=470fdd51b44f52eb93c90e8e7c32db11c87aed88bda28ba32f4e79a22a64a097&
11:12 < bridge> <learath2> I don't. I very rarely do electronics so I bought like an assorted resistor set, a couple dozen caps of different values and a handful of leds like a decade ago
11:13 < bridge> <learath2> So I just mess around with those and the one arduino nano I have lying around üòÑ
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got a arduino uno and 2 boards
11:13 < bridge> <_vozdyx> guys?
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> @_vozdyx ofc u can
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> but if its to get help for a bot then not
11:13 < bridge> <_vozdyx> thk :brownbear:
11:14 < bridge> <learath2> Oh I also have a box full of old cmos logic gates from back when I made a couple things like an ALU
11:14 < bridge> <_vozdyx> Not really, that‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs all about, just communication)
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got this saved and just found it
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i forgot what exactly everything is
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> the thing on top left is a temperature sensor
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> for water
11:15 < bridge> <_vozdyx> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1166666311187845190/IMG_20231025_161442.jpg?ex=654b51ac&is=6538dcac&hm=232fa14bf394edc41e0a604f807ffa967a24de200be35e2ff2dc02dd06485438&
11:15 < bridge> <_vozdyx> Do you even think about selling this or not?
11:16 < bridge> <learath2> Oh also a couple dozen zener diodes are nice to have for when you need a reference for sensors
11:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is this?
11:16 < bridge> <learath2> How is that development related? üòÑ
11:16 < bridge> <learath2> Tis a vape
11:16 < bridge> <_vozdyx> this electronic cigarette
11:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> @_vozdyx u can chat here but it has to be somewhat tech related
11:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:17 < bridge> <_vozdyx> Health development)
11:17 < bridge> <_vozdyx> for Game?
11:17 < bridge> <_vozdyx> Can I write suggestions for improvement here?
11:18 < bridge> <_vozdyx> Well, if so, do you have an idea
11:19 < bridge> <teero777> it was hard to resist making a pun
11:19 < bridge> <teero777> it is hard to resist making a pun
11:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
11:19 < bridge> <_vozdyx> Make a vote so that it doesn‚Äôt happen that if there are not enough votes to exclude a player from the game, but there are more votes for than against, then the player is excluded from the game. Also make a system so that if there are false votes, the player will be punished or it will be written ‚Äúyou cannot kick a player for such a reason‚Äù
11:20 < bridge> <_vozdyx> good?)
11:20 < bridge> <teero777> "no reason given"
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh it has a radio receiver
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> annd a mic
11:21 < bridge> <_vozdyx> yes
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> speaker and temp too
11:21 < bridge> <_vozdyx> To write, you need to write a reason to start dubbing.
11:22 < bridge> <_vozdyx> and it will be good
11:25 < bridge> <teero777> @ryozuki whatcha doin?
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> nothing rn just looking at stuff to do some embedded rust
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i also want to look if i can make something to continuously gather data (temp, ph) from my 100l aquarium xd
11:26 < bridge> <teero777> RyoOS?!?
11:26 < bridge> <teero777> nice
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> no this is os-less
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal
12:23 < bridge> <kekomonter> Looks like resistors pillow :gigachad:
14:25 < bridge> <syrexmain> Hi guys, help me pls to get full access to the cheat, just need 3 installations https://cheatlab.org/
14:26 < bridge> <kekomonter> :kek:
14:27 < bridge> <kekomonter> @Discord Mod ^^^
16:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 ur alter ego account? xdd
16:20 < bridge> <furo321> It's robyt4
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rob1t
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> robyt alt?
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> he wouldnt miss a newline at end of line
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> he wouldnt miss a newline at end of file
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> intentional miss
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
16:54 < bridge> <Ewan> troll review
17:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u need dis for w√∂rk?
17:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> no xd
17:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i think it can be nice for benchmarks
17:26 < bridge> <louis> whats newline for
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's the posix way
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or unix
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or whatever
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but every line has to end with a new line
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nowadays it's not required, but it's still nice to select all code at once without jumping around with the cursor
17:28 < bridge> <louis> ok i see
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks i knew i saw a video
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wow
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u know that u watched a video
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
17:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 3 years ago
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
17:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> good brain
17:32 < bridge> <Ewan> ive never seen a video before
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it makes no sense anyway
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i never seen a "i see" before
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> only latin speaking ppl get this joke
17:33 < bridge> <Ewan> too bad
17:44 < bridge> <learath2> How?
17:45 < bridge> <learath2> I could see it being useful for some population sim, but benchmarks is a curious use
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> nono its just computationally intensive or smth i guess
17:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> a coworker used it to bench the language xd
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok just forget what i said
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:51 < bridge> <learath2> Ohh, ok as a benchmark. It doesn't seem particularly grueling, but I can see it being used
