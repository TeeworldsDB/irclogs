00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen do you have a Script or maybe even a single query to unreleased a map? That also removes all times and points from MySQL database?
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Im 'corneum how long until you can let a computer drive your car do you can play racing games in the gained free time
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Im 'corneum how long until you can let a computer drive your car so you can play racing games in the gained free time
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 have a minute?
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 voice?
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2297
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2297/files#diff-71fce8fdaae8d92953b0e82717dbc3a0R1225 brace style
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's already merged, and I'm considering reworking most of it, brace style doesn't really matter, does it? ðŸ˜›
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 would you come to clan-nut.de to merge the voicechats?
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uh, don't really have ts here
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 would you come to <known ts server> to merge the voicechats?
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh actually do
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, editing on discord won't be too helpful
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> haha ye the brace style annoyed me as well
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whoever finds me a clean-ish way to abstract out argument parsing from CConsole gets a cup of coffee
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon don't think so. I don't like deleting released maps
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> the prediction margin graphs are now absoulutely useless. i have mega laggs but the line stays straight
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen yea me neither i just accidentally messed up one map and would like to reset it
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Jao knows well how to delete ranks
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @ScReeNy you know well how to be cringy:kek:
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> theres nothing "cringy" here
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thanks @fokkonaut

17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> also here pls
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats what people mostly read and what gets previewed by github
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ask @deen
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh u have no permissions for that?
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i do not understand github permissions
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 can you take a look at a commit for me?
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Learath2/teeworlds/commit/5956b96ef2b185e6b0ec8361f4d95007a364b33f ^^
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wasnt it Command *s* Manager?
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well, you usually omit the plural in that case
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you think this looks cleaner? I didn't finish it, but it'll also work for the serverside, reducing the code duplication
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dk
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thanks for the feedback
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> didnt really review yet
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I like it
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 1 quick thing I wasn't sure about, do you think I should expose SCommand? The functions accessing it's internals via index look a little dirty to me
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dont you think you should make a cpp file too?
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably, this was quicker for testing around
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should split the implementation so oy doesn't chomp my head off
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 expose it I guess, const pointer
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd call it `CComand` though, I think
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 Yeah, it'd also need getters so it'd be more of a class then a struct
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is buf[0] = '\0'; faster than mem zeroing it?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I actually have no idea ðŸ˜›
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd guess memzeroing the entire thing would be better, but that's not safe with non PODs
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think mem zeroing might be easier for debugging
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can recognize a 0 value faster
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or idk
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats PODs
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.pods.com/
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Plain old Data
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess this wont have a vtable so it should be fine. Tbh I'm not much of a C++ person so Im not always familiar with the intricacies
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure its unsafe to memzero if it does have a vtable
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i bed POD is safe to memzero
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bet*
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not entirely sure tbh if you go the language lawyer way
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but in practice, yes
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 it wouldn't need getters as long as you only have arrays
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how? Make the members public?
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess if I never hand out a non const pointer it should be safe
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and return const references
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 ?
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ?
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 ?
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Const references to what?
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just what you said about const pointers
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just said references accidentally
