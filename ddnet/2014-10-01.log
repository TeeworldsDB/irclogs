16:56 < EastByte> deen: you already read the thread about the ingame record feature I guess?
16:57 <@deen> i read it
16:57 < EastByte> I will till him that we aren't sure whether it will be added okay?
16:57 <@deen> yeah
17:08 < Maple> oh and
17:08 < Maple> i did a record
17:08 < Maple> but i dont have the demo
17:08 < Maple> so is it possible to get it through the server record thigny
17:08 <@deen> we don't have a server record thingy
17:08 < EastByte> there was a test :D
18:15 < laxa> Maple: to ensure best chances to have a demo of a run.
18:15 < laxa> You should either use the autorecord demo OR the ddrace demo record, not both of them.
18:15 < laxa> If you use one and find bugs about it, report it here or on gituhub.
18:44 < laxa> deen: solo team doesn't work.
18:46 <@deen> laxa: show me
18:46 < laxa> come on ddnet.tw:8313

21:06 < Maple> but i know i have a reason to be mad at them
21:06 < Maple> xD
21:07 < Maple> well its gonna build competition
21:07 < Maple> which might be fun
21:07 < Maple> or destructive
21:07 <@deen> fun for laxa to reupload a single map 10 times :P
21:07 <@deen> map video*
21:07 < laxa> Yeah xD
21:09 < laxa> Ok, annotation added on the old video.

21:18 < Maple> naughty deen
21:19 <@deen> and not a single spam post since i added the questions at registration
21:20 <@deen> the captchas were way easier for the spammers
21:22 < Maple> oh i remember why im mad
21:22 <@deen> Just when I said it: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=473&p=3913

21:22 < Maple> they beat my time by cheating on koule 5
21:23 < Maple> rofl
21:23 < Maple> how to kill religion

21:23 <@deen> Aaaah, i updated the forum today
21:23 <@deen> and my questions disappeared!
21:25 <@deen> Better!
21:25 <@deen> Spammers never know the answer for "What does TW stand for?"

21:31 < laxa> this is so : wtf
21:34 < Maple> like if anyone who played video games didnt know about it
21:36 < Maple> oh please santa, motivate me to do my homework, ill be a good boy

22:30 <@deen> getting ddosed right now
22:30 < laxa> I'll add to the plugin
22:31 < laxa> yeah I know, honky came to annoy me about that

22:35 <@deen> EastByte: i just have to stop reloading the status page and I'm fine^^
22:35 < EastByte> okay
22:51 < laxa> should be working correctly and announce FRA down
23:01 < heinrich5991> deen: what is cheating?
23:01 < heinrich5991> (in ddrace, I mean)
23:01 <@deen> heinrich5991: in what context?
23:02 < heinrich5991> [21:22:55] <Maple> they beat my time by cheating on koule 5
23:02 <@deen> I guess they found a shortcut
23:02 <@deen> in the map
23:02 < heinrich5991> ah ok
23:02 < heinrich5991> cheating sounds like doing something illegitemately
23:03 <@deen> sometimes map shortcuts are too severe, so they have to be fixed and ranks removed
23:03 < heinrich5991> aha
23:03 < heinrich5991> and I guess you do this by hand?
23:03 <@deen> yes
23:03 < heinrich5991> "ranks removed"
23:04 < heinrich5991> ok
23:04 <@deen> when the start line is skippable, you can always do 1 second times
23:21 < pause> laxa: youporn team wtf ?
23:21 < pause> which game ? Where can i apply ?
23:21 < laxa> true story bro !
23:21 < laxa> they already chosed their team, it's gonna be dota 2 or LoL team
23:21 < laxa> it'll be announced in a few weeks
23:21 < pause> they chose but they don't know which game oO
23:21 < pause> sounds weird
23:22 < pause> or maybe their strategy is to send naked girls to distract enemy team
23:22 < laxa> I don't think that sponsorship will give them any nature advantage xD
23:23 < pause> Well that's the only reason to apply, duh
23:23 < laxa> Money ?
23:26 < pause> Well, why not
