13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can you edit the laser doors so you can put a delay on the length tile and you arent limited to 3,6 and 9 tile wide lasers
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> rotating doors would be cool to ðŸ¤”
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Meh what nobo implemented vote_mute and no vote_unmute.
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
19:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Was probably someone who dislikes democracy and votes.
20:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> :GWfroggyZoomeyes:
22:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> muteip doesn't work through fifo
22:14 <@heinrich5991> fifo is a completely thread-unsafe thing that should be burned with fire IIRC
22:58 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: the bridge still doesn't work :D
22:59 <+Learath2> but yes, I remember the same thing
22:59 <@heinrich5991> still = again I guess
23:01 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: nah, we blocked it because of the stupid irc spam
23:01 <@heinrich5991> did we?
23:01 <@heinrich5991> I think I reactivated it a couple of times since then
23:01 <+Learath2> jao did
23:01 <+Learath2> did you? :P
23:01 <+Learath2> it's currently blocked
23:02 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: did you have a plan to migrate the ddnet client to using the 0.6.5 connection protocol?
23:02 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:03 <@heinrich5991> but I seem to have exactly 0 time for teeworlds/ddnet right now, so I can't implement it
23:03 <@heinrich5991> http masters would have higher priority anyway
23:03 <+Learath2> will you have time to do it or do you have an outline for it? I tried to dig a bit but couldn't really see a clean way to fit it in
23:03 <@heinrich5991> depending on how compatible you want to be:
23:04 <@heinrich5991> 1) send 0.6.5 connect, after two seconds also send a ddnet connect, keep supporting the ddnet protocol for the time being
23:04 <@heinrich5991> 2) send 0.6.5 connect, after two seconds also send a vanilla connect, don't keep supporting the ddnet protocol
23:05 <@heinrich5991> 3) only send 0.6.5 connect, breaking compatibility with mods based on ddnet prior to my fix
23:05 <@heinrich5991> also who wrote that damn code to ignore all non-vanilla non-ddnet connects? :(
23:34 <+Learath2> also who wrote this entire thing tbh
23:34 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: did you ever notice that Feed in network_conn has an unused parameter and probably most of the code is dead? :D
23:36 <@heinrich5991> no, I did not
23:36 <@heinrich5991> you mean the SecurityToken, right?
23:36 <@heinrich5991> sounds bad, I hope it's checked at another level
23:38 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: no, it's only used in the CONNECT case
23:38 <+Learath2> SecurityToken is only ever the default argumen
23:38 <+Learath2> t
23:39 <+Learath2> I couldn't get the debug message under m_SecurityToken = SecurityToken with any client I could think of either
23:39 <+Learath2> so I concluded it's dead :P
23:41 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:41 <@heinrich5991> kay
23:41 <+Learath2> I couldn't figure out the flow, so I just got pissed and went for dinner instead
