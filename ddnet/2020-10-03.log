00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> Reverting https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/9b0081de5 fixes it
00:17 <+ChillerDragon> what do you mean by https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2921#issuecomment-702825017 @heinrich5991 ?
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Fireball would be nice if u open an issue or tag deen directly
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> deen = def-?
00:18 <+ChillerDragon> yes
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> Reverting https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/9b0081de5 fixes it @deen
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> @deen I've edited in a mention in a comment above - hope it
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> @deen I've edited in a mention in a comment above - I hope it's visible
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> I'll try to figure out what went wrong in that commit
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum probably it fixed the values in all other tunes following it
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, i think i know why
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Fireball thanks, RC2 should have it fixed
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> > @Fireball thanks, RC2 should have it fixed
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> @deen I've commented on the pull request - seems like there is another issue
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, indeed :/
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> oh maybe thats why + binds ignore modifiers
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> good guess ðŸ˜„
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, got to find another way to block off ctrl-shift-d then
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm, the old one doesn't work either, we just hard code ignored ctrl-shift
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe we should just hardcode ctrl-shift-d and ctrl-shift-g as ignored
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> move ctrl shift d to ctrl shift x
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> I think the problem is that we use shift (and tab) as though they are regular keys and not modifiers

01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is there a refresh skins button too? might be useful
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> since there's a refresh assets
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just open an issue
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok

01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also how do you get a cover image
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> Desert Mountains.png?
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> looks cool with the mountains ðŸ˜„
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> thanks :D
12:21 <+AlwaysLivid> Hey, is this the development chat for ddnet?
12:21 <@deen> AlwaysLivid: hi, yes
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can we dilate the speedup arrow data/editor/speedup_arrow.png
12:22 <@deen> sure, why not?
12:22 <+AlwaysLivid> (wait, is the channel bridged?)
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can u xd
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, hello
12:22 <+AlwaysLivid> hello!
12:23 <+AlwaysLivid> (presuming this is the discord)
12:23 <+AlwaysLivid> I'm currently trying to port the game to the Haiku operating system!
12:23 <@deen> Yeah, there is a bridge to discord and also to freenode#ddnet
12:23 <+AlwaysLivid> ah
12:23 <@deen> Ha, that is cool!
12:24 <@deen> Anything we can help you with? Are you an official Haiku maintainer?
12:24 <+AlwaysLivid> well i'm not a maintainer but i like contributing stuff a lot!
12:24 <+AlwaysLivid> I got SuperTuxKart running a few months back and I figured that with the current set of dependencies (emphasis on SDL2) 
12:24 <+AlwaysLivid> but long story short, well
12:24 <+AlwaysLivid> uh the x11 library dependencies are sort of giving me a hard time
12:25 <@deen> DDNet probably has quite a lot of dependencies, but we could optionally disable some stuff
12:25 <+AlwaysLivid> (they are available but we entirely avoid them for, well, the reason being that haiku is not *bsd or linux based)
12:25 <@deen> what do we use the x11 deps for? notifications?
12:26 <+AlwaysLivid> i'm really not sure, there's libnotify there as far as i can see
12:26 <+AlwaysLivid> but i'd presume it's probably related to linux window stuff :P 
12:26 <@deen> Yeah, we could just add another special case and have no notifications on haiku for now
12:28 <@deen> I guess the problem is that currently we handle everything that's not windows or mac as linux/bsd
12:28 <@deen> so Notify and X11 are pulled in
12:28 <+AlwaysLivid> hmmm
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> please put mothod for know if this switch on or off:saddo:
12:29 <+AlwaysLivid> yeah that does make sense, i'm no expert but i do normally make use of bsd-related cases in order to make stuff work on haiku
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761897698327920671/unknown.png
12:29 <+AlwaysLivid> (android can also be helpful sometimes because of cases involving a system that doesn't run x11)
12:30 <@deen> yeah, unfortuantely we removed android support a while ago
12:31 <@deen> I think in this case we still want libnotify and X11 on BSD
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dilate is destructive, right? Maybe we should keep a copy of the things we dilate
12:32 <+AlwaysLivid> not even leftover code or anything? hmm (i'm really not 100% experienced with stuff like this but i'm trying my best)
12:32 <@deen> we removed the leftover code since it was unmaintained
12:32 <@deen> I'll give you a PR to try in a few minutes, will try to special case haiku a bit
12:32 <+AlwaysLivid> nah please don't bother with it yet, i'm just asking general questions in order to gain a better understanding
12:33 <+AlwaysLivid> (i'm also having problems with libopus and am not sure if a library like that exists right now and whether i should port that as well-- it's too premature for me to tell and stuff)
12:33 <@deen> hm, ok. In that case just try removing find_package(Notify) and X11 in CMakeLists.txt, and removing the notifications code in src/engine/client/notifications.cpp
12:34 <@deen> about opus: if it's super-hard to port, it's not really essential. some maps use it for background music, not required for playing
12:34 <+AlwaysLivid> working on it, thanks!
12:34 <+AlwaysLivid> eh it'd probably be best to keep that in
12:34 <+AlwaysLivid> it's not like it's technically impossibel
12:34 <+AlwaysLivid> *impossible
12:34 <@deen> sure, would be better. but I don't know the opus code, so can't judge how hard. but i guess it should have no external dependencies at least
12:35 <@deen> and you'll also have to remove the ${X11...} and ${NOTIFY...} in CMakeLists.txt
12:35 <+AlwaysLivid> I'm working on a very non-elegant way to approach this (removing lines instead of adding if... else cases) just to get it to run
12:35 <+AlwaysLivid> yup already done
12:35 <@deen> ok, good
12:36 <@deen> yeah, that's fine I think. when you got it working you can clean it up. but no need to overengineer before you're even sure it will work
12:36 <+AlwaysLivid> so the weird thing is that opusfile actually exists but is not detected
12:36 <+AlwaysLivid> yeahhh and the if else cases shouldn't be that hard
12:36 <@deen> See cmake/FindOpusfile.cmake. We are using pkg-config to find the system lib
12:37 <+AlwaysLivid> got it
12:37 <+AlwaysLivid> okay this is probably the most productive i've ever been as far as this thing is concerned, huge thanks for your help
12:38 <@deen> Oh, and OPUSFILE_LIBRARY only searches for NAMES opusfile, maybe on Haiku you have some kind of prefix/suffix
12:38 <@deen> could just append that after "NAMES opusfile " to make it find it
12:39 <@deen> AlwaysLivid: thanks to you for trying to port DDNet to Haiku :)
12:42 <+AlwaysLivid> i just came across the game as i was browsing steam so
12:42 <+AlwaysLivid> it's like "hey here's something spontaneous for me to kill my boredom"
12:45 <+AlwaysLivid> yeah opus exists, it's just something w/ my system
12:46 <@deen> what's the filename for the opusfile shared lib? something like opusfile.so?
12:49 <+AlwaysLivid> nah the headers really actually arent in my system for some reason
12:49 <+AlwaysLivid> they should work flawlessly
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> ddmax_freeze didn't use transparancy for the curves so I draw a new one.
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761907623373045760/ddmax_freeze.png
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <mind> Imo mapres from ddnet that don't ship with the vanilla client should be in a subfolder.
13:32 <+AlwaysLivid> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/gJ24JP2vx5 deen 
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You again seem to be missing headers
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think that might be a problem with our cmake setup too
13:35 <+AlwaysLivid> the missing pnglite thing is negligible honestly
13:36 <+AlwaysLivid> anyways a very very draft tree can be found here: https://github.com/panos/ddnet
13:36 <+AlwaysLivid> it's that cmake thing that needs to be dealt with only i think
13:36 <+AlwaysLivid> not sure how to fix it so i'm asking around
13:40 <@deen> AlwaysLivid: something like this? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2986
13:40 <+AlwaysLivid> Should I try that?
13:41 <+AlwaysLivid> (P.S. My @ on GitHub is @panos)
13:42 <+AlwaysLivid> brb
13:42 <@deen> Yes, would be nice
13:45 <+AlwaysLivid> works! (i think!)
13:46 <+AlwaysLivid> OKAY IT DID IT
13:46 <+AlwaysLivid> LETS COMPILE THIS BABYYYY
13:47 <+AlwaysLivid> okay that went wrong
13:48 <+AlwaysLivid> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/FFpZ6DdprW
13:49 <+AlwaysLivid> woooooo boy
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> fix skin selector please
13:50 <@deen> does haiku support posix semaphores?
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (we could feature detect for these if we want)
13:52 <@deen> see system.h:543
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh someone cleaned up my awful execute-all script on ddnet.tw
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> thanks ðŸ˜„
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if it's a rewrite in python then heinrich did it
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> this zone even after selecting "custom colors" is working and scrollers can work or not, just random
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761918699853578250/unknown.png
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's in shell, so it's not heinrich?
13:53 <+AlwaysLivid> deen, probably
13:53 <+AlwaysLivid> i have to ask again
13:53 <+AlwaysLivid> https://github.com/haiku/haiku/blob/c62142a72bd760f999a1f05b0547107cfda9fa11/src/system/kernel/posix/xsi_semaphore.cpp
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe i don't undestand
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> AlwaysLivid double check if they support anonymous semaphores. macOS pretends it has POSIX semaphore support but it can only do named semaphores in reality
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> @deen
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761919984376479754/skin-selector-bug.mp4
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://gliderkite.github.io/posts/formicarium/
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> AlwaysLivid https://github.com/haiku/haiku/blob/5dcd02dff29b7f7302a27a7dfbe17c9c9064fd8b/src/system/libroot/posix/semaphore.cpp#L115 seems they do support POSIX semaphores completely
13:59 <+AlwaysLivid> yup i also noticed
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so you can just add haiku to CONF_FAMILY_UNIX I guess?
13:59 <+AlwaysLivid> not sure where that is so i'll just add a new case that does the same thing
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> src/base/detect.h
14:00 <+AlwaysLivid> alright that uint64 definition is now what i need to beat
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> WTF
14:01 <+AlwaysLivid> yeah that's me irl
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i swear i hate popups xD
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ??
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @gerdoe I still don't get it looks like the bars work just fine
14:09 <+AlwaysLivid> apparently DIR (from dirent.h) variables are a Linux-only thing and they're actively discouraged
14:26 <+AlwaysLivid> opened up a github issue for the time being, will check back in later https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2988
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe  @Learath2 it seems like the names are changing while moving the mouse, but I can't reproduce
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lolwtf
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe ubsan would catch it?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> tried valgrind already
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe any more hints for how to reproduce, do you click something?
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 could you check https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2978 please?
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> building
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen works for me
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @gerdoe hm, I guess the skins selector somehow extends further up in the background and stays active, but code looks correct
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 so bors r+?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i want to test too, bcs my binds didnt work when i programmed my stuff
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to take a look at the code too ðŸ˜„
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> interesting
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so ctrl+shift could be used for a absolut cursor for scoreboard for example
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in csgo e.g. u can click things in the scoreboard
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @gerdoe u got some custom skins btw? or only the ones shipped with the client
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `CListboxItem Item = UiDoListboxNextItem(&s_paSkinList[i], OldSelected == i);`
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> without the & ?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just point the to actual skin pointer
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen ^ just that u see the fix for the skin scroll bug
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> If the version in #announcements is RC2, then why does the screenshot show `15.1-rc1`:tee_thinking:
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Can the "Use current map as background" button remember previous value, or just override that setting without replacing user-specified map?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen Your skin downloader introduced a little inconsistency. When a skin is downloaded you call `LoadSkin` for that skin which adds it to the skin selector in the settings. But the `downloadedskins` folder is not loaded when the client is restarted. Not sure how to handle this best though, should all skins from the `downloadedskins` folder be loaded on startup or should downloaded skins not appear in the skin selector?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Jupstar âœª
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Currently it should download every skin every time. Bcs we don't have something to check if the skin is out dated
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Why are skins even saved to disk then?
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I dunno maybe for easy copy
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I would just add a clear download cache and load from disk first probably. Dunno what deen planned tho
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @deen  maybe like this but for  choice of entities (walls ,kill block, block (hook through ) ....etc
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761962324339851274/dd.png
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro that is intentinoal
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, the idea of storing them on disk is so that you can copy it if you like it
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> @deen ig you need my res (1600x900)
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> @Jupstar âœª several from db and shipped
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª i tried that and with your "fix" i can now suddenly reproduce the issue gerdoe had ,haha
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't understand how it's supposed to fix it
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> custom colors -> bar moving -> select skin -> try to move bar or click nearly
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761966838749593630/2.mp4
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> someone help
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i've changed my resolution and now i cant open the game
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @louis remove the resolution from settings_ddnet.cfg with a text editor
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> thanks
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Blade> Hello, I'd like to make a suggestion: An option to add maps to favourites so that you can look through them when you wanna play a good map with your friend
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Blade> and the maps will be in a tab, ordered from insane to novice
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I think the issue is in RenderHSLScrollbars
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> AH, it's ui clipping ðŸ˜„
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I can't reproduce it though
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess the clipping is a little meh
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @deen I have a complaint about bad ping on GER1. According to him he has 25ms on GER2 but 65-70ms on GER1
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 70ms is not bad ping
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @deen I have a complaint about bad ping on GER1. According to him he has 25ms on GER2 but 65-70ms on GER1
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> His ign is muhistar18, plays quite frequent ddrace aswell
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> yeah its not bad when you are playing on 70+ ping
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> when you are playing with ping 20 mostly 40 is annoying as well
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but if its unstable and jumps between 20 and 70 then thats probably worse than high ping
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, our UI clipping is only graphical
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I freakin love the assets changer, if only there was also refresh button so that it'd reload assets without the need for client restart, that'd be 15/10 rating
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Soreu isnt there a refresh button?
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761985615004172318/screenshot_2020-10-02_18-07-44.png
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its there for those assets
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> not for skins tho
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> am I fckin blind or what
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I am fckin blind lol
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> sorry :nouis:
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 15/10 then
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One off IJobs still requiring you to define a type is rather annoying
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very teeeny tiny issue
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The engine isn't even initialized by the time storage gets created
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So the integrity check needs to be in a module of it's own, but I have no idea what to call it
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Learath2Integrity
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :nouis:
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are almost as creative as me ðŸ˜„
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh nvm, the engine doesn't need to be initialized before we use the job pool
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> Is anyone already looking into why cloud animations in background are choppy?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> It looks like we're using floats to keep track of time for the animations, but float'
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> but float's precision is not sufficient to count every 1/60 of a second since 01.01.1970
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Fireball always or just in theme? Maybe we don't update the time often enough in menu?
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> In themes. Try winter theme - it should be most noticeable
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fireball> I already got a fix, will send a pull request in a few minutes.
