01:34 <+nameless-tee> deen, ok. I thought the main ddosers are kids from blocker servers, but seems it's not that simple.
11:23 <+Hamid_Jigool> hello my friends
11:23 <@deen> hi Hamid_Jigool, welcome
11:24 <+Hamid_Jigool> a problem was happend for me: 
11:24 <+Hamid_Jigool> FATAL ERROR: Could not init SqlScore
11:24 <+Hamid_Jigool> on new DDnet version Sql mod
11:24 <+Hamid_Jigool> whats this error
11:24 <+Hamid_Jigool> ?
11:25 <@deen> Not sure, HMH changed some stuff in there
11:26 <@deen> You have to set up the sql server in a different way now
11:26 <@deen> instead of sv_sql_ip "localhost"
11:27 <@deen> you need:
11:27 <@deen> add_sqlserver r teeworlds record teeworlds "password" "localhost" "3306"
11:27 <@deen> add_sqlserver w teeworlds record teeworlds "password" "localhost" "3306"
11:27 <@deen> maybe that's it
11:28 <+Hamid_Jigool> no i have back up from old version
11:28 <+Hamid_Jigool> i want run new version with old back up
11:28 <@deen> ah, then maybe the problem is that the database format changed
11:28 <@deen> new version of what?
11:28 <@deen> old backup of what?
11:29 <+Hamid_Jigool> is there any way to update database?
11:29 <+Hamid_Jigool> wait...
11:29 <+Hamid_Jigool> old version of 9.2
11:29 <+Hamid_Jigool> new
11:29 <+Hamid_Jigool> 10.2
11:29 <@deen> there should be no db format changes
11:29 <@deen> try what i told you
11:30 <+Hamid_Jigool> ok
11:44 <+Hamid_Jigool> again error
11:44 <+Hamid_Jigool> FATAL ERROR: Could not init SqlScore
11:45 <+Hamid_Jigool> maybe its for bad compile
11:45 <+Hamid_Jigool> ha?
12:00 <@deen> I would suggest opening a github issue or ddnet forum post, then i can tell HMH to look into it
12:00 <@deen> I don't know why, sorry
