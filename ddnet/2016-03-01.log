12:10 < Killur> Hello, can someone tell me how I can display a message to a player from the CCharacter class?
12:10 < Killur> I have tried:
12:10 < Killur> CGameContext *GameContext = (CGameContext *) GameServer();
12:10 < Killur> GameContext->Console()->Print(IConsole::OUTPUT_LEVEL_STANDARD, "test", "test");
12:10 < Killur> But the message gets shown in the rcon console, the player cannot see it.
12:28 <@EastByte> Killur: I guess you want to send a chat message instead?
12:41 < Killur> I'm trying to send a message in yellow
12:41 < Killur> Like when someone writes /help
12:41 < Killur> But only for this specific player
12:41 < jabba> hi all! someone can help me with server config? i remember, how in old ddrace versions when you edit current map on the server, and save it - server automaticaly reloaded map.
12:42 <@EastByte> Killur: yes, that's a chat message
12:42 <@heinrich5991> Killur: maybe something like GameContext()->SendChatTarget()
12:42 <@heinrich5991> jabba: are you logged into the rcon?
12:42 < Killur> Ok I will try it later thank
12:42 < jabba> heinrich5991: yap
12:42 <@heinrich5991> mh
12:43 < jabba> only "reload" help
12:45 < jabba> any ideas? ^^
12:47 <@EastByte> jabba: you need to be sure that the mapfile you are editing is the same that the server currently is running
12:47 <@EastByte> otherwise I don't know why it doesn't work
12:47 <@heinrich5991> jabba: the code is still present in the client
12:47 <@heinrich5991> you have to connect via 127.0.0.1 though
12:47 <@EastByte> oh?
12:47 <@heinrich5991> not 192.168.*.*
12:48 <@heinrich5991> // send rcon.. if we can
12:48 <@heinrich5991> // and if we're on localhost
12:48 < jabba> oh!!!
12:48 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/4f6e2eb11f00f1a44285f7ef541ff3d7ea6e2295
12:48 < jabba> heinrich5991: ty! i connect from 192.168*
12:49 < jabba> need from 127.0.0.1
12:49 < jabba> didnt know about that :o
12:49 <@heinrich5991> me neither :D
12:49 <@heinrich5991> I read the code ^^
12:49 < jabba> ty all!
13:55 <@deen> well, i had to add a filter like that because it's dangerous when an admin is playing on a public ddnet server and accidentally causes a reload
13:59 <@heinrich5991> ah
13:59 <@heinrich5991> that sounds bad ^^
13:59 <@heinrich5991> people's races getting randomly aborted
15:12 < FlushA> hello
16:27 < jabba> one more question
16:28 < jabba> its posible to export textures from maps?
16:28 <@heinrich5991> yes
16:28 < jabba> how? 
16:28 <@heinrich5991> but the easy way is to just "append" another map to yours
16:29 <@heinrich5991> it includes some layers and all images
16:29 < jabba> mkeyy
16:29 < jabba> heinrich5991: mhahahah~!
16:30 < jabba> its works, ty!
16:31 <@heinrich5991> np :)
16:32 < jabba> heinrich5991: maybe ddnet have textures-repo?
16:32 < jabba> ot smthn like this
16:33 <@heinrich5991> dunno
16:35 < jabba> want this http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b269/flowerchild7777777/new_gun_inaction.jpg xD
16:36 < jabba> *vietnam flashbacks*
16:36 <@heinrich5991> do you talk about the guns or about the map in the picture?
16:37 < jabba> guns :o
16:37 <@heinrich5991> that's called a game skin :)
16:38 <@heinrich5991> but I also don't know whether ddnet has a repo of game skins :/
16:38 < jabba> its not game skins .-.
16:38 < jabba> ok
16:40 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: is the source code of the skin database public?
16:41 <@EastByte> no idea
17:06 <@deen> jabba: i think some people are working on a textures database for ddnet mappers
17:07 <@deen> but nothing exists yet
17:07 < jabba> deen: ty :3
17:08 <@heinrich5991> deen: and my question? :P
17:09 <@deen> i don't think it is
17:09 <@deen> oh, i might have uploaded it here^^: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/tree/master/www/skins
17:23 < Gabeee> nice
17:23 < Gabeee> the hats are cute
17:40 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/pull/6
17:41 <@heinrich5991> untested
18:08 <@deen> heinrich5991: hm, i'm not sure if that's better
18:08 <@deen> now all the bandana brothers skins (start with 00) are mixed throughout
18:16 <@heinrich5991> mh.
18:16 <@heinrich5991> if you want them together, maybe we could sort by that column first
18:20 <@deen> i don't know what is better
