00:00 <+ChillerDragon> last time i had some flag on build and it worked just fine i just forgot what it aws
00:00 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon why does helping u make me so infuriated
00:00 <+Ryozuki> xddd
00:00 <+ChillerDragon> chill
00:01 <+Ryozuki> i cant help it
00:24 < Izanagi> wtf is this
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ddnet: suggestion:ddnet: 
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> Add an option to arrange them from highest points to lowest
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/826946314180231208/unknown.png
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> sadam
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> hussain
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> why f4:ww:
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> points =/= skill
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> ^ that's what a person without skill would say
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> that's what a person without points  would say
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> that's what a person without points  would say
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :think_bot:
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> true
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so we need quick way to know who have skills
06:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> play with him lol
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1617270539.png
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> yikers one month no CI ? :/
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> im not even using that much stuff. Did the ddnet org also reach that limit? Are you paying? doubt.
10:35 <@deen> nope, no limit reached I think
10:35 <@deen> where to see it?
10:43 <@deen> maybe because we are under an organization?
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> HI guys can you check what is wrong with the bot in discord for points this guys profile doesnt match at all
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> https://ddnet.tw/players/EsiGAMEr/
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Seems like Iran server isnt counted in the stats by the bot
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcell_HUN> I mean if you look at someoneâ€™s team finishes you can define his skill, because you can have lots of good finishes in t0 but they arenâ€™t a real achivement in my opinion because you can literally do almost nothing and still finish
11:06 <+bridge> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> Pros rate the skill of others based on their ranks.
11:06 <+bridge> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> Or not even that. Name yourself nameless tee and use default skin and join a random t0 map. Others will see within 30 seconds if your are good or not and behave different towards you. For example better players getting saved first or saved with a technique that requires some pro team skill.
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i know if you have points this not necessarily mean you have skills
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but usually if you not have points you not have skills/noob
11:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> I mean you can judge skill in about 30 seconds just seeing their movement
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> or one second in  Tab
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> points help you to  know who noobs
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> deen: idk where to see the limit i just got the mail
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> also yikes the ddnet-git aur package install gtest and then fails the build
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> can still nobody on arch reproduce the gtest error? thats so weird
11:59 <@deen> did you install gmock?
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: looks good
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/827124939789565952/screenshot-20210401121840.png
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Settings -> Billing
12:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> Looks unused
12:20 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> Is that ur private acc?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Only account I have
12:21 <+ChillerDragon> first day of the month i guess
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm also not using any of those things
12:21 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1617279685.png
12:21 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder where this storage is used
12:21 <+ChillerDragon> must be some tw repo ci
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> maybe my maps ci is disk usage intensive idk
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> thats what a person that wants to show off would say
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Marcell_HUN> @hussainx3 ye true

14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 arent you the biggest SDL fan?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for some reason, and its also happening in 15.3(in borderless window mode)
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in debug mode, windows shows the task bar when pressing the meta key on your keyboard
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and in release mode it doesnt
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> since SDL is compiled in release mode it kinda has to be smth in our code
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> really strange
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh no that sounds awful to debug
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its impossible xD
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you launch the executable the same way?
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just use  visual studio launch, but also tried just double click it
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you have console enabled in both cases?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> since 15.3.2 console isnt enabled anymore and i also didnt enable it
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I remember that causing a few issues, when visual studio attaches itâ€™s own console it creates some oddities
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as sry
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 15.4
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is our current version
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but doesnt matter
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, Iâ€™ll take a look later I guess. Sounds interesting
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok ðŸ˜„
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 we should promote more the wiki
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobody contributes :Sadge:
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :Sadge:
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should make the wiki prettier
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should have content before making it prettier
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but u are free to make a css theme
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to work on the homepage but then I remembered making the homepage pretty actually is quite annoying
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/MediaWiki:Common.css
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.factorio.com/
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this one looks nicely themed
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if thats what u mean by prettier
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well theming is one thing but I meant more the homepage structure
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> E.g. en.wikipedia.org they have a vanilla mediawiki yet the homepage looks nicely structured
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh lol
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You ruined us
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the button said "create new pr to revert this pr"
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> didnt know it creates it in ddnet xD
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this one
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/827166760708210718/unknown.png
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> all data lost? :POG: lets build ddnet 2.0
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Didnâ€™t know you had push access to the repo even
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought you were a reviewer ðŸ˜›
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah rip xD
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Inb4 jupstar force pushes over the entire history
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just a prank
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good thing git is not centrilized
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> despites the efforts for it to be
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Did we have an issue for these out of list clip bug?
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno what to search xD
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes if you mean the input not clipping properly
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I always lose it too.......
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i want to apply the fix
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> #2990
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2990
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep right as I found it ðŸ˜„
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tnu0oQrT4Y
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lmao it really works
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> restart ur discord client & go in notifications
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> Idea for a new tile : Swap tile : if u are in freeze state, it unfreeze u, else it freeze u :D
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> add mod prop-hunt
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u cant just add a mod
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u have to ask someone to code it lol
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sadly ppl would just cheat but it would be fun
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ye i got the same idea while walking around as a tile
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> feels good
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> who knows, maybe if 0.8 would have a mooving entities code and it would be possible then maybe
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> moving tiles you mean
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Danny Hpy> moving entities
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> moving entities already exist
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Danny Hpy> not every entity can be moved
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> every
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> you can do it in KOG but not on ddnet
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> flag, tee, heart, armor...
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> i always wanted them on ddnet but deen wanted to have support for vanilla clients
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> those are pickups
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> and tee is not entity
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> or pickup
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> at least i think
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> its not
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> you can use moving tiles and freeze on kog
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Danny Hpy> so KOG maps with moving entities can't be played on vanilla clients?
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ye but its not the same, and you cant make those mooving tiles follow your player
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> they arent moving entities
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> they are moving quads
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> its more of a quad that acts like a specific entities
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> you dont see them in entities unless you set entities background to the map background
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> you can see them with 1 little command i console i think
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> it was on 1 of those kog maps
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> its a map thing and there is command to enable/disable them
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> you need to then set the layer name to that specific name (like kog_mooving_tiles or something)
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> character is enitity
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> armor and heart also are children of entity
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> entity != tile that what i wanted to say
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> we can create a map good  to play prop-hunt and hide and hide names and we get the game almost
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Danny Hpy> Yeah kind off
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> we can create a map good  to play prop-hunt and hide  names and we get the game almost
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> it's ez need just Some special touches than creater
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> try to do it yourself
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> good start at programming
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i with but i can't
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> wish
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> it's looooong way to learn how make maps and learn programming too
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i don't think so
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> month for basic thing like syntax, functions, oop and so on
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> in general
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and funky time of programming and exploring tw code
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so yeah long time
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i really like programming and want learning
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but it's not good time now
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> +lessons to learn anything need english
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @ChillerDragon  how does thy typing font thing work in your client?
23:31 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> press t
23:31 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> and type
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> aaah thanks
23:32 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> works for all tiles :D
23:32 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> u can speedmap if you know the keys :D
23:33 <+bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> im not sure if i did all the rework and fine tuning only for my pr on ddnet tho. Like word jumping newlines etc cursor
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> ok it doesnt work good for me at all xd
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> the letters appear 5% of the time
23:51 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
23:51 <+ChillerDragon> maybe try different zooz
23:51 <+ChillerDragon> but ye its untested on windows
