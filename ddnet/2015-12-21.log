19:45 < ImYFU> "DDraceNetwork was an idea by Megaman with support by Delo and onionly .me' in the summer of 2013..."
19:49 < Ryozuki> but im doing the video about just fly 1 :D
19:49 < Ryozuki> so it will be included
19:49 < Ryozuki> its the evolution of skill in that map
19:49 < Ryozuki> this is only 2 parts of the map D: http://i.imgur.com/aPN15B8.png
19:50 < Ryozuki> 7 mins actually
19:50 < Ryozuki> well maybe like 3 parts
19:50 < Ryozuki> because one is too short
19:53 < ImYFU> I know what you are doing
19:54 < ImYFU> I am online on forums half a day
19:54 < ImYFU> per day
19:57 < Ryozuki> :o
20:02 <@deen> Ryozuki: his rank sucked
20:02 <@deen> Ryozuki: so the video is useless :P
20:05 < Ryozuki> hmm

20:06 < Ryozuki> well at 2011
20:06 < Ryozuki> hf sucked xd
20:07 < Ryozuki> i will leave it there just to see how it worked in 2011
20:08 < Ryozuki> who knew to do hf in 2011 was a god i think
20:11 < ImYFU> I knew it was possible
20:13 < Ryozuki> but u could do it?
20:13 < Ryozuki> :P
20:13 < ImYFU> no
20:13 < ImYFU> I can't do it now
20:13 < Ryozuki> lol xd
20:14 < Ryozuki> it's easy to learn
20:14 < ImYFU> I am not a ddracer/racer
20:14 < Ryozuki> i know
20:14 < ImYFU> this knowledge is useless 
20:14 < Ryozuki> yep
20:14 < Ryozuki> this conversation too
20:14 < ImYFU> what are you gonna expect me to do with this
20:14 < Ryozuki> :D
20:14 < Ryozuki> with what
20:14 < Ryozuki> the hf?
20:15 < ImYFU> y
20:15 < Ryozuki> fly to the moon
20:15 < Ryozuki> and it always looks nice
20:15 < Ryozuki> :s
20:15 < Ryozuki> but if u dont play ddrace
20:15 < Ryozuki> maybe its useles then
20:15 < ImYFU> yeah, to the ceiling of the ctf4_old you meant
20:15 < Ryozuki> but i do it even in openfng xd
20:16 < Ryozuki> you can
20:16 < ImYFU> ^and your team loses lot's of points
20:16 < Ryozuki> do it there
20:16 < Ryozuki> yes
20:16 < Ryozuki> but u can do it there
20:16 < ImYFU> whatever
20:16 < ImYFU> fng
20:17 < ImYFU> playing on ctf5
20:17 < ImYFU> ctf5 is not suitable for deathmatch-like gamemodes (except for grenade, it's fine because of higher movement speed)
