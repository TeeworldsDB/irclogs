15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> any admin can review the pr now ty
15:31 <@deen> I'll assume that you're talking about https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1055
15:31 <@deen> Anyone up to it?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/422763938741223425/unknown.png
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its waiting 😄
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `(int64)((float)time_freq() / (float)g_Config.m_GfxRefreshRate)` – converting to float shouldn't be neccesary
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (given that you cast back immediately)
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you want to round, you can add `g_Config.m_GfxRefreshRate/2` to `time_freq()`
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah good catch, i'll remove that fastly
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's also a `if (` which should be `if(` 😛
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what line is it
15:42 <+Mattia> i buy hosting by ovh, and My friend help me for create ts3 on vps... but the ts3 have 32 slot.. can one guys help me for have ++ slot? ( i don't know how use putty)
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah found
15:43 <@heinrich5991> Mattia: do you have a non-commercial website for the community that uses the teamspeak server?
15:43 <@heinrich5991> they seem to have a non-profit license available that gives you up to 512 slots
15:44 <+Mattia> is not commercial, but i don't know where have license and how add on putty
15:44 <@heinrich5991> do you have a website for the community that you run the ts3 server for?
15:44 <@heinrich5991> this seems to be a requirement
15:45 <+Mattia> no
15:45 <+Mattia> only ts3
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so for apache2.0 license should i add the license?
15:45 <@heinrich5991> Mattia: then it seems you can't get more than 32 slots if you don't want to pay for the teamspeak server
15:45 <@heinrich5991> see http://npl.teamspeakusa.com/ts3npl.php
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ apache2.0 license?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for the icon font
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's something separate from the current PR?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the next pr xd
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, you'd need to add that somewhere
15:47 <+Mattia> heinrich, i don't need profit. But need some slot for other clan..
15:48 <@heinrich5991> from the website I linked:
15:48 <@heinrich5991> Please apply only if you meet the following requirements and you have a need for a TeamSpeak server with more than 32 slots. Otherwise, you may download TeamSpeak's standard server software which includes 32 slots and does not require a license.
15:48 <@heinrich5991> You MUST have a verifiable, operational website on a custom domain (eg - 'www.mygroupsite.com') that demonstrates community activity.
15:49 <+Mattia> i can't with my vps ?
15:49 <+Mattia> without website?
15:50 <@heinrich5991> you can't get more than 32 slots on your teamspeak server without having a website with community activity
15:51 <+Mattia> and if i have more 32 friend -.-?
15:51 <@heinrich5991> then you have to use a different software than teamspeak3 if you don't like that I guess
15:51 <@heinrich5991> it's teamspeak3 that's making the terms, not me
15:51 <+Mattia> if i don't listen this terms?
15:52 <@heinrich5991> then you can't get more than 32 slots ^^
15:52 <@heinrich5991> the 32 slots thing is the thing where you don't need to apply anywhere
15:52 <+Mattia> but this ts ts.low-gaming.it, don't have website but have 50slot
15:52 <@heinrich5991> then ask them how they got the license
15:53 <+Mattia> with crack
15:53 <@heinrich5991> yea, I won't support that
15:53 <+Mattia> but if i want i can crack for have +23?
15:53 <+Mattia> +32?
15:53 <@heinrich5991> I have no idea
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this is ddnet dev channel u crackhead
15:53 <@heinrich5991> noby: I told them to ask in #ddnet rather than PM, it's my fault
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> o
15:54 <+Mattia> ok sorry for disorder
15:54 <+Mattia> bye :)
15:54 <@heinrich5991> bye
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 is ban by name implemented yet?
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the ip censor to mods is making me unable to deal with a troller rn
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should revert that asap
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the troll leaves when i join
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thus cant ban him
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then join with a different name I guess
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, ban by name is implemented: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1068
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ can you use the `time_get()` function to implement `time_get_milliseconds()`
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it looks like this has a bit of code duplication
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 u should enable it for moderators
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in autoexec.cfg
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> accesslevel name_ban 1
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> smnth like that
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it wasn't actually added for that
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki btw, re "it's not bugged, it is explained in my initial comment, on the rifle section:"
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when you fall down, and shoot the laser down. should it really teleport you?
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with no walls involved
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u have the tele laser enabled and it doesnt hit anti tele tiles then yes
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u could show me
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. that's different from what it said in the comment though 😛
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh nvm it is not
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looked at "teleport gun"
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @heinrich5991 time_get needs to set new game_tick
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i cannot work with the game freq
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I nuked a subnet, hopefully that stops him
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats the actual problem
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> time_freq*
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> because i don't want to overflow the variable
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ can you factor out the common parts of `time_get` and `time_get_milliseconds` into `time_get_impl` and call this function for the common parts instead?
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh ok
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what is time_get_impl
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is it stored somewhere else?
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> missread
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u mean the syltox bot guy?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I think so
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, Contina communications users can't connect to GER for now
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's prolly a VPN tho so he'll get new ips soon 😛
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ the new `time_get()` is missing a `return` at the end, `time_get_microseconds` doesn't need the extra pair of braces anymore
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah thx
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ also, `time_get_milliseconds` should probably divide by `time_freq()` on linux and mac
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> by
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `time_freq() / 1000 / 1000` ?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> something like that
16:27 <@heinrich5991> deen: are you running apt on the servers ATM?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is that better style xD
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> at the end u know the value of time freq
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ yes, basically better style
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it makes the number of constants involved smaller
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. I didn't know that these are just constants on mac and linux off the top of my head until you reminded you
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. I didn't know that these are just constants on mac and linux off the top of my head until you reminded me
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> time_get_impl() / time_freq() * 1000 * 1000
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or devied the tiem freq
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what do u prefer
16:38 <@heinrich5991> divide the time_freq
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but either is OK I guess
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks for responding to the concerns so quickly
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll take a final look, but the rest looked OK IIRC
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you moved the `Input()->NextFrame` tick so that it is now independent of the graphics rerendering. do you know why it was previously only called when a new frame was rendered?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno but its a keyboard state
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont see sense having it inside
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let me check who added that, maybe they know why it was placed inside
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ it was explicitly moved there with https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/72a6e20ba8781a6cb677364d8d9a0ce9217093e2
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like we need to understand this before we can move it back
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ürpbaböy bcs of android or something
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its synced with the renderer anyway
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the issue doesnt happen for me
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> is that mac specific?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, sounds like we should ask deen on this matter
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if we want to change it
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen ^
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 👍
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah under linux i get this
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tripple click
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then i move it back
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you should understand code before removing it 😛
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i read the sdl wiki
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and sounded like it was ok
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can use `git blame` to see which commit introduced a line of code
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but deen already says in the issue its strange
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `git blame src/engine/client/client.cpp`
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can also recommend `tig`, it has a UI that is a little bit better than that of the `git` command, then it's `tig blame src/engine/client/client.cpp`
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> github provides this too i think history
17:00 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> personally I use hg-git to get a UI I find more comprehensible 😝
17:00 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> also... ♥ hg fa  (fast-annotate)  in particular --deleted  http://m8y.org/tmp/blame1.xhtml  - check this out. is it not awesome...
17:01 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> (that's a pipe to ansi2html
17:01 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> )
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ shouldn't it be `time_get_impl() / (time_freq() / 1000 / 1000);` everywhere except for windows?
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mac seems like nanoseconds
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah im stupid xD
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then you can just ask for `CONF_FAMILY_WINDOWS` and use this expression otherwise
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but not remove the not implemented?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can remove the not implemented then
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so muhc trouble for one function 😫
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry :/
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but code duplication is bad
19:10 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #1079: Add reason to name bans (master...dd_pr_namebanreason) https://git.io/vxfro
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i'm fixing a translation for ddnet, and it seems you translate the exact same string 3 times xd
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g Spectator
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what even means "Wait before try for"
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nvm
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does that mean? 😄
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it sound weird for me
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but google translator told me the exact meaning
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😄
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't understand it
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe someone google-translated it into english? ^^
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> from your language?
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it is in the data/languages
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im translating that to catalan
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Espereu abans de provar-ho"
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I think that's wrong english 😄
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki anyway, that's only in a comment, so it isn't in game anyway
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> really?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then why it is in the translation files!!!
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 😠
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> useless work

20:21 <@heinrich5991> ?
20:22 <+F11> hello / i installed ddnet server and upload mysql base whith score...
20:22 <+F11> how base sincronized whith other server?
20:22 <+F11> sorry bad english
20:27 <+eeeee> F11: you can't sync with official ddnet servers
20:28 <+F11> ok. score will only be on my server?
20:28 <+eeeee> yes
20:29 <+F11> then what are they?
20:29 <+F11> thx for help/
20:32 <+F11> why are they uploaded to the official website?
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if u play on an official server it uses the official site
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> otherwise it doesnt
20:39 <@deen> They are uploaded just so that our data is open
20:39 <@deen> And you can analyze them and make some fun statistics
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> deen
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> unban me
20:41 <@deen> worstwish: what kind of ban? I'm probably out of the loop
20:41 <@deen> You might want to talk to administrators if you've been wrongfully banned on official DDNet servers

20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 what if someone fakes another and uses bots
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 why votes are not recorded? u might know who funvote xD
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because voting is even more private than chat?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't even see it on the actual server
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mmm
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and vote_start is not recorded because it contains the reason
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which is also user-set text
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well u usually dont put private reasons there
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most of reasons are just insults anyway
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 u know were is documented the string format? for commands? e.g `?i[distance]`
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 u know were is documented the string format(?) for commands? e.g `?i[distance]`
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I don't think there's explicit documentation
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> could you create it? 🙂
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would be nice
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i don't even know how it works :D
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> code is in `src/engine/shared/console.cpp`
