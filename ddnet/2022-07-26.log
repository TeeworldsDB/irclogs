00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dr.Funmanteddy> its worse than that. The bored apes thing is literally nazis

01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @nuborn don't we have door prediction nowadays?
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> we have all the info, but no prediction was made
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Omg, there is a server on CHN7 that has been up for 33 days
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's so long they didn't get the 16.2 update yet, the old hud shows
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 33 days doesn't seem that long, but that means that the server never was empty for 33 days straight?
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> o i don't doubt NFT community is pretty correlated with white supremacists
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> he's not that bad tbh but by the sound of it ur memeing anyway
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> indeed
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> Not yet, no, orininally i wanted se how entity ex worked for a bit before adding anything
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I'm still for replacing entitiyEx with new extended netobjects that hold all information.
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Two objects for one thing plus the fact that the client has to sort them together does not sound good to me, compared to the fact that we actually have an extended netobject system
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> I guess it would be only for lasers first, if the new pr gets pulled
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> But with the recent work on making netobjects more extendible it might be a better solution in general
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> isnt there a multeasy server at like a year or smth
02:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no way ðŸ˜„
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nfts itself are not art
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are just a link that might go down
08:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont fool urself
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> it can be other, than a picture btw and people miss that point
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> non fungible token != picture art
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReD> Mass produced, low quality art is still art. Also not all nfts are bored apes. But even then, likely bad to invest
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The think is the nft itself is no art, since its not a picture but merely a http lini
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Link
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> What the contents of that link are can change any time
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Since thats served by a server external to the blockchain
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZaTd0hDtkI
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragere> this is a very good explanation
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> there was an nft that changed when you bought it
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> from a mid piece of art to literally ðŸ’©
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> from a mid piece of art to literally ðŸ’© this emoji
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> Most nfts nowadays are referenced to images or whatever hosted on blockchain hosting sites like ipfs, so the thing about them going down or being changed isnâ€™t an issue(unless they intentionally make it that way like voxel mentioned).  I think the nft art thing is really stupid but the technology behind it is really cool, like an nft could theoretically represent ownership of anything, like the title to a car or property, or it could be
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> world was better without internet tho
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ipfs is still like torrent, if a file is not seeded its gone too btw
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw does anyone have example teehistorian data?
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> +1
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> medical records on block chain, great idea xd
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> medical records on public block chain, great idea xd
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> There are ways to make it encrypted and only give keys to those who need it, it would be really useful but shit never gets updated in governments with technological advancements anyways so it would be a long time before anything like that could come about
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> what even is the point of being able to prove ownership over your medical records?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> Itâ€™s more about ease of access, like if you go to a different hospital or one in a different country then they are able to access it, I only mentioned it bc itâ€™s just another thing that the technology behind nfts can do
12:03 <+gerdoe> yo bros did ya see c++23 feature freeze?
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what would the benefit of "putting it on a blockchain" be?
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could instead have a file, signed by your medical authority instead, that you can share with hospitals. or a link to that data hosted on government servers
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> The whole point of it is that itâ€™s not owned by any one government and is a more universal thing, itâ€™s likely the medical thing wonâ€™t come into fruition because governments like to do their own thing and not work together at that scale, but itâ€™s the same incentive for currency not being owned/backed by any government or organization and instead just backed by code
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but what's the benefit of it 'being backed by code'?
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean how would you even store medical records 'on the blockchain'
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you likely don't want to put all the data there, because it's too expensive
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you link to it
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> So from the currency perspective, if the USA(my country) is in debt they can print money, but being backed by code, no one can print bitcoin
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why are you talking about money?
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wasn't saying that cryptocurrencies make no sense
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was asking about uses for nfts
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at that point, you might just share the link instead doing stuff 'on the blockchain'
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> But the sharing of the link to it is exactly what an nft is
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can also share a link without an nft
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to my medical data
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what value-add does the nft have in that use case?
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> So itâ€™s more that everything can be done in this ecosystem -system and it is all secure
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> Like yes you can do it using another method
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you haven't yet said *any* benefit
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can also share my medical records while playing the flute
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like yes, you can do it using another method
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's more that everything can be done while playing the flute. and it's all more fun ðŸ˜‰
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> that is true, the flute is fun
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> no the flute sucks
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> The current things that exist on blockchain are typically in finances because ppl like money, there's 'banks' with loans and interest and all that, there's markets to trade things, but what's starting to be developed now since the hype from making money is starting to die down is actual infrastructure to move all types of data on blockchain
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> medical records is one thing, but the fact that we are able to securely transfer data in that way on a public blockchain is insane
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, if medical records aren't a good example, I'm also willing to listen to any other example where nfts are useful
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> I mean like I also said it could be ownership of anything, like the deed to your house, any valuable you have, there could be warehouses of items owned by people that could be freely traded without having to have physical possession of it, but that's about it for nft's specifically
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, so you say that having 'your house' on the blockchain is a value-add?
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> "The NFT doesnâ€™t convey ownership of the copyright, storage, or usage rights to the asset itself. As White explained, when someone buys an NFT, â€œTheyâ€™ve paid to have their wallet address etched into a database alongside a pointer to something. I wouldnâ€™t say they really â€˜ownâ€™ anything at all."
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> This is what an NFT is, simply, that's dumb af
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> you could take a mortgage out on your house for example in a decentralized way
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what guarantee would the holder of the nft have that it really corresponds to your house? how do you make that connection between the real and the blockchain world?
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> It's not about actually owning something like images, obviously you don't own the bored ape image, it could be attached to physical things and that would be real ownership but would have to be agreed upon by people and governments
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> it's the same thing as a long time ago when there was a physical paper to be a deed to the house and that would prove ownership, it's about the people and governing bodies agreeing that it has value
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> Also NFT's are like a really small part of the whole crypto development idk why they get so much hype
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> I mean it does have a lot of value
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but then the decentralization goes away
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> but its literally just a pointer to metadata
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the government isn't likely to say that "oh yes, there was a bug in the smart contract of all the plots in this country. now the person who hacked the contract owns all of the land of germany, that's fine"
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it's still the government ruling over which trades are fine and which are not
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we were talking about nfts because you said that they were useful
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> they are!
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but what for?
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see how the house example is a good one
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> ok how about a simpler example that doesnt require years of understanding from millions of people to agree on it working
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> have you ever played CSGO?
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I did
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> what if you could actually own the skins
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> and it's not at the mercy of the game developer whether you can sell your $100 skins
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're always at the mercy of the game developers
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they can just say that they don't accept your $100 skin if you sell it
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> you can just send it to someone else and trade like everyone else does
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> but if you get trade banned then you cant
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> if it's on the blockchain as an nft you can
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, you can't, or at least not in a useful way
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the game company says "we're not accepting the nfts currently held by @Skystrife anymore"
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you still 'own' something, but it's not of value as a skin anymore
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the game company is the ultimate arbiter of what happens in their game
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> That obviously depends on how they implement it, but you could have a game that makes it fully decentralized
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, so you get your fully decentralized game
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then I'm just gonna copy your skin and it looks just like yours
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the only difference is the author
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> That's just not how it workes
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> works
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, so you only accept nfts from a certain contract?
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> correct
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where's the decentralization?
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> I feel like you might find this really interesting
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> I do at least, but the gist of it is that it is completely community run
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> you could make an entire game or company or whatever, then have everything done in it be governed by the users
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, so we're at least very far away from it having to do anything with CS:GO, right?
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> obviously yeah but I mentioned csgo because i figured you were familiar with the skins and trading
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> everything in blockchain is still very early, so it wont be adopted for a while
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> The research behind it is really cool though imo
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see an incentive for valve to adopt it in any case
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, so you want to run a community-run game with skins as nfts
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do more skins get added over time?
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> they could be yeah
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> similar to how skins are added to this game, people submit them and they get voted on
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what happens if the skin contract has a bug? the whole game is useless?
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> that's the beauty of the DAO, there is governance and contracts can be changed based on voting
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, the contract cna be changed
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so any random person with some money could just come in, buy a bunch of governence tokens and destroy the game?
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> I mean technically not changed more a function gets directed to a different contract but yeah
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> governance tokens don't have to be bought or sold they could be given based on whatever you want like for a game maybe be given based on playtime or something
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> the options are literally limitless
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has to be something that can be verified on the blockchain
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it's pretty limited
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see how you could take playtime for example, unless you can only play on the blockchain
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> I mean yeah there has to be servers for a game to run so that has to be centralized somewhere, but you can interact and send data to the blockchain in a lot of ways
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but then it's suddenly not community-managed anymore
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the people hosting the servers can unilaterally change the game
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> ok like
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> DDnet is community run right
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really?
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> what?
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> If I want to I can come up with a feature and submit a pr and if people like it it will be in the game
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, ultimately because it will be accepted by deen
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if deen doesn't want to have a swastika as the game's logo, it's just not gonna happen
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even if the whole community is in favor of it
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> Yeah that's fair haha
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> I don't expect that to happen
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i donâ€˜t think iâ€˜m the only one with control, iâ€˜d be ok with the other admins overruling me
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you'd stop hosting the servers if it required you to do illegal things like displaying nazi signs ^^
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> What I was saying tho is that this game could have some sort of blockchain interaction if people wanted it and that could also be community managed.  I don't think it would help this game but its cool to think about
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but there is no democratic process. sometimes we call for a vote to see if something would be liked
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> more of an oligarchy I see
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Blockchain interaction? ðŸ˜•
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> I dont think it would fit this game haha
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Each hammer hit goes on the bitcoin chain, 15 minute ping
13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> lmao
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> anyway @heinrich5991 you may not think that there's much use to nft's or blockchain in general, but I think it's really cool but I wouldn't go and recommend people invest in crypto or NFTS, I would recommend at least ppl here(I assume have some sort of CS background) could invest in learning the technology because I do think at least in some way it will be used a lot in the future ðŸ˜„
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> anyway @heinrich5991 you may not think that there's much use to nft's or blockchain in general, but I think it's really cool and althrough I wouldn't go and recommend people invest in crypto or NFTS, I would recommend at least ppl here(I assume have some sort of CS background) could invest in learning the technology because I do think at least in some way it will be used a lot in the future ðŸ˜„
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think that there's not much to *nfts* in particular
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> anyway @heinrich5991 you may not think that there's much use to nft's or blockchain in general, but I think it's really cool and although I wouldn't go and recommend people invest in crypto or NFTS, I would recommend at least ppl here(I assume have some sort of CS background) could invest in learning the technology because I do think at least in some way it will be used a lot in the future ðŸ˜„
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I haven't said anything about blockchain
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> I mean you are right about that, NFT's are like 2 lines of code xD
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think I know enough about blockchains, wanna quiz me? ^^
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I want to believe that because I know enough about it that I think nfts look useless
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They are
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> I mean do you know about different blockchains and how they work or how NFT's work on them?
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I do
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, maybe I only know how ethereum's nfts work
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ultimately the world is centralized around governenrs, you can start playing with ur "decentralized" toys but when smth they dont like thats where it stops
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I guess it works similarly on other blockchains
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Goverments*
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> governments*
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> Then you should know that what I said from the start, "the underlying technology behind NFT's is really useful" because there are tons of different things in smart contracts on Ethereum for example but also others that are built off of the NFT contracts but arent just "oh I own picture now"
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> sadly that's kinda true and why it will take so long for adoption
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 'if you know anything about the subject matter, you'd have the same opinion as I do'?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> PoW = making our current climate problem even worse btw
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but there's PoS, so that's not a great argument
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> nonono I'm not saying that haha i'm saying that my point originally wasnt even that NFT's are good, but the tech behind them are
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> sadly don't have skill about blockchain, only know that irl ur in a trust system where u have to trust anybody while blockchain solves that with a proof state
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There are downsides to that iirc
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> Actually tho in the long run it could be good
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> less than actual system lol
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> PoW caused so many solar farms to be built to run the crypto farms
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> One of the biggest criticisms of PoS is that it is less secure than PoW. Because PoS does not require miners to expend energy in order to participate in the consensus process, it is possible for individuals with malicious intent to take control of the network by acquiring a large number of stake tokens.
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I took this as saying that nfts can be useful for anything. I wanted to show how I disagree with that. I didn't talk about blockchain technology in general
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> and now that things are transitioning to PoS and other securing measures those farms are being redistributed to respective government power grids
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But currentlt it runs side by side
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> that's completely fair
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> Not the most pleasant, even if you create folders, so that there are no messages, you need to create for each mod
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1001458867286323271/unknown.png

14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it also caused a coal power plant to be continued
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> That happened a lot less than solar bc its a lot more expensive in the long run
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> [citation needed]
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skystrife> true
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> Is it a good idea to create a third console to output https/game/png/datafile messages?
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'd probably be better to make the current console's output more useful

I think I need a shorter notification or output to another console, the first thing that came to mind

16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> big news
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The Ferrocene Language Specification (FLS) is a document describing the Rust language. It was created by a joint effort between Ferrous Systems and AdaCore as one of the prerequisites for qualifying Ferrocene, a Rust toolchain qualified for safety-critical environments. The FLS is compiled of existing Rust documentation, but presented with a rigorous structure in order to meet the requirements of qualification.
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The FLS is not intended to be used as the normative specification of the Rust language nor is it's meant to replace the decision-making processes of the Rust project. Any difference between the FLS and the behavior of the rustc compiler is considered an error on our part and the FLS will be updated accordingly.
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> someone knows a map that use a color envelope on a tiles layer?
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Zaiross-Gores
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> indeed! thx
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oguz> I think "wait" command should be added for console. For example after binding [bind d "+right; wait 120; emote 3"] to console, pressing "d" will go right, wait 120 milliseconds and send emote.
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> no, this would allow even more powerful dummy bind
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oguz> but, there is some legit bot clients, right?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> "legit" and "bot client" dont go in the same sentence :D
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> "legit" and "bot client" cant go in the same sentence :D
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <oguz> idk i heard from someone and saw a bot site that say its legit

23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > page) and I submit their email.
