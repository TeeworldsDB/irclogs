04:59 < bridge> <gody1604> im hosting a server but for some reason the random_map command gives me "no maps found on this server" even though there are maps and if I go to vote to change to a different map it loads it.

09:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> was about to ask a question about my code not working
09:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> then i rubber duckied myself realising that last time that fixed it
09:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and i found the issue
09:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> than you #developer channel for being my rubber ducky
09:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no it still doesnt work
09:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no it does i just didnt recompile

09:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> what failed my guy x-x
09:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> shame ):
09:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> another client to steal features from
09:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> mwuhuhuhu
09:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @gody1604: I think it needs to know about the maps in the database. So that they also show up in the /mapinfo chat command
11:03 < bridge> <chairn> rather old but still on point i guess
11:03 < bridge> <chairn> https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jun/30/give-up-github-launch/
11:05 < bridge> <Assa> I already host my own gitlab. This is an open source project, we can mirror it where-ever we want
11:05 < bridge> <Assa> good morning ^^
11:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> If we switch then pls to smth fast like gitea. GitLab is really powerful, but also a downgrade compared to github imo
11:09 < bridge> <chairn> why is that ? seems pretty equivalent to me, but im not a big user of any
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> UI is worse, the analytics are worse
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> When I hosted a gitlab instance you notice how bloated that software is.
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The runners are probably matter of getting used, but github has a lot of pre-built runners by community.
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> white design is evil
11:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Also the fact that they require a phone number to login sucks
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> gitea looks really clean. and the performance is also really nice.
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Basically a better github
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1361631114636169347/image.png?ex=67ff754b&is=67fe23cb&hm=0074455e720f59bca58e21da561e2200f8b67cd1847bc2f8ee1540e1064d303b&

11:29 < bridge> <Assa> This is not true for self hosted, even tho I use it for MFA
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> gitlab ui sux hard its hard af to find prs and issues
11:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> if i see a project there i tend to get unmotivated to contribute
11:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> pls use codeberg or a self hosted forgejo
11:30 < bridge> <Assa> on the left? I use it all das at work without issues oO?
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yeah but why should we self-host? xd
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I self hosted once, but the phone thing was on the real gitlab
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> forgejo > gitea
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> codeberg is a european non profit
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> it uses forgejo
11:32 < bridge> <Assa> True, I do it for private repos
11:33 < bridge> <Assa> on the left? I use it all day at work without issues oO?
11:36 < bridge> <Assa> Yeah gitlab official has not so great UI design ðŸ™ˆ
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yeah codeberg is sick too
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But I just noticed they have a (beta) dark design
11:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> At least smth ðŸ˜‚
11:50 < bridge> <oxyzo.> Hi developers what are you developing
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Ryo is enjoying holidays.
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I am struggeling with random stuff.
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> What r you doin?
11:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @jupeyy_keks I just made finished durak and serverside translation
11:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> :poggers2:
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Sick
11:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> what are ya struggling with?
11:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Nothing specific, just thinking about code layout
12:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> does anyone know any good C related irc channels/discord servers?
12:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> \#\#C
12:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @jxsl13: we have lerato here what do you need
12:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> trying to compile gitjub.com/marlam/msmtp on CentOS 7 (holy build box)
12:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> trying to compile github.com/marlam/msmtp on CentOS 7 (holy build box)
13:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> getting macro AM_GNU_GETTEXT not found, even tho, I compiled gettext manually
13:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> only on centos 7 I get that error, on debian based systems I'm not getting that
13:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> ```
13:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> configure.ac:46: warning: macro 'AM_GNU_GETTEXT' not found in library
13:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> configure.ac:46: error: possibly undefined macro: AM_GNU_GETTEXT
13:02 < bridge> <jxsl13>       If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
13:02 < bridge> <jxsl13>       See the Autoconf documentation.
13:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> autoreconf: error: /usr/local/bin/autoconf failed with exit status: 1
13:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> ```
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> #c in on libera
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> It is a very no bullshit no stupid questions place though, not the nicest people but the very best usually
13:18 < bridge> <learath2> Though this is not much of a C question. I haven't seen autohell in years
13:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> the autostuff is the least of my problems xD one one of many
13:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> might have found some clues, cuz I build all my external libraries and tools into /usr/local
13:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> and my final result into a different PREFIX
13:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> might be that some environment variable was set incorrectly pointing to a wrong folder and not seeing that I also included /usr/local/{lib,include}
13:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> ._.
13:23 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's generally fun building old software in old build environments
13:24 < bridge> <learath2> are you using the correct version of automake? I remember that being an issue when I last compiled something that used it
13:25 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'm building my own autoconf, if automake is part of that, don't remembrr exactly of it was
13:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> if it was
13:26 < bridge> <learath2> I think you also might need to call autogen.sh with a flag to make it find your self compiled gettext, unless you installed gettext properly
13:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> seemingly not
13:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> the weird thin is that on debian 7 and ubuntu 16.04 it works, so might have something to do with the preinstalled gettext or something along the lines on those.
13:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> thing*
13:28 < bridge> <jxsl13> but on centos 7 I also got a gettext installed, which is not found.
13:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> will see in like 40 minutes ðŸ˜„
13:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> if my attemt at a fix works
13:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> ```
13:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> autoreconf -i -I "$PREFIX/include" -I "$EXTERNAL_PREFIX/include" &&
13:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --without-msmtpd --with-tls=openssl --with-libidn --with-libgsasl --with-libsecret=no &&
13:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> make V=1 -j $CORES LIBS="-l:libgsasl.a -l:libgss.a -l:libidn.a -l:libntlm.a -ldl -lrt -lresolv" &&
13:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> make install 
13:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> ```
13:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> that's the msmtp build call
13:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> with some additional C(PP)FLAGS and LD_FLAGS
13:46 < bridge> <art0007i> anyone know how to disable this? github keeps telling me my ddnet fork has CodeQL failing from time to time
13:46 < bridge> <art0007i> 
13:46 < bridge> <art0007i> I don't want to disable all actions and I'm too scared to just delete the CodeQL workflow file
13:46 < bridge> <art0007i> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1361669046944403517/image.png?ex=67ff989f&is=67fe471f&hm=59ffa05d3e514d3709456365e569f98cea3c83078fd158318ec540ca2364ce95&
13:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> rename the workflow file to .ymlx
13:47 < bridge> <jxsl13> or something along the lines
13:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> let's se eif building and pinning my own automake helps ðŸ‘€
13:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> there is no autogen.sh, you might mean ./configure
14:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> heino is in all of the irc channels :kek:
14:29 < bridge> <always> u should steal the scoreboard things
14:30 < bridge> <art0007i> ok, but I guess if that file is modified and I merge upstream will it bring it back? I think it's fine I guess because that file isn't touched often
14:44 < bridge> <learath2> Oh, if the configure file is already created then it's not an automake version issue
14:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @art0007i wat ya doin?
14:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> interesting
14:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1361683819274436748/image.png?ex=67ffa661&is=67fe54e1&hm=6cfa893d296d001a7db448707a6c2a6ad72d73efe444e1602e2a81a3d877958f&
14:46 < bridge> <art0007i> updating my ddnet fork ig. but while im updating it i noticed that github has been emailing me about codeql stuff xd
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> wow discord shares such information with all clients? XD
14:47 < bridge> <art0007i> also yeah funny that it knows how many seconds my clock is behind???
14:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm guessing it's the message sent timestamp and message received timestamp
14:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it tells you the timestamp that the client sent the msg with
14:48 < bridge> <art0007i> well I've synced my time allegedly
14:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its not that its 8 seconds ahead, its that its x - network lag seconds ahead
14:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> *at least* 8 seconds ahead
14:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
14:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> can we merge taters input prs plz
14:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> me want to play game without dying due to packet loss
14:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I quite like time.is for checking my clock
14:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> > The difference from Time.is was +0.008 seconds (Â±0.025 seconds).
14:50 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that's probably good enough, right?
14:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> very
14:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `+0.006 seconds (Â±0.060 seconds).`
14:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk how it knows that
14:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/AM_005fGNU_005fGETTEXT.html
14:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> network latency fluctuation is what im guessing is the +-
14:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is
14:51 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I guess it does a thing similar to normal time servers, it just tries a few times
14:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to me it looks like my system clock is exactly the same
14:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do system clocks on windows and linux de's sync to the ms?
14:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> For me it's consistently giving a bit under 10ms late
14:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> For me it's consistently giving a bit under 10ms late on average
14:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats close enuf
14:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i cant tell
14:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> im on a 60hz panel = 16ms littlest delay so vsync means they switch at the same time if its 10ms
14:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> they should stay exactly the same, the big issue is that one likes to store the local time and the other likes to store the UTC time
14:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wdym
14:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the local time is derived from utc time
14:53 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> when setting the RTC
14:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the hardware rtc is in local time but that isnt used for anything
14:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (apart from remembering time after reboot)
14:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> exactly, and one system sets it to UTC+0 and the other sets it to local time
14:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> "system"?
14:54 < bridge> <always> so tootltips didnt work so i make my own
14:54 < bridge> <always> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1361686225118826697/DDNet_hUTnF8tvmn.png?ex=67ffa89e&is=67fe571e&hm=4ece1cc064f53d9aa2450da4e3b8547673c1749e19a183741bf22c0f9015b000&
14:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> operating system
14:55 < bridge> <always> not sure how im gonna make a pr out of this
14:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh thats bad
14:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so if you don't have network, you shut down one OS, open another OS, your time will be off by some hours
14:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats... annoying
14:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm not sure if it's an issue anymore but it used to be
14:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ur rtc should be in local time
14:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and also ntp will update it quite quickly anyway
14:56 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Why do you prefer this?
14:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because the rtc is dumb and old, its like setting a wall clock
14:56 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it doesnt know about time zones
14:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that's why it should be in a time zone that never changes
14:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> our software isn't necessarily dumb and old so it can handle time zones easy
14:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> os's arent dumb
14:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but the bios is
14:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and it has always been local time
14:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so it should stay that way
14:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to prevent... the issue your having
14:58 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if and when you also get a timezone param for the rtc then its fine to store in utc
14:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if and when you also get a timezone param (as a minutes offset and/or 3 digit code) for the rtc then its fine to store in utc
14:59 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you might already be able to
15:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If every OS agreed on UTC+0 there would not be any issue?
15:00 < bridge> <chairn> is there a way to use automount and have it ask for the remote server password whether in nautilus or bash when you try to access it ?
15:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's literally just a convention and I don't understand how local time is any better
15:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its too late now, so a breaking change is the only way for os's to cooportate
15:00 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> timedatectl seems to set rtc to utc
15:01 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i assume windows then does it the old way
15:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> hell yeah Arch Wiki is being based unlike you
15:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> xd
15:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> they shit so much on the Windows time handling lol
15:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8432
15:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is this ever gtting merged?
15:12 < bridge> <learath2> Looks fairly terrifying. I don't think anyone wants to be the person who broke the input handling for no reason
15:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> have it run on a single server and see if it breaks
15:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk if you can rerun teehistorian files, but is an option
15:14 < bridge> <learath2> Why even risk it? That's probably why no one seems very interested in it
15:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because its a dependency of another pr which i very mcuh care about
15:14 < bridge> <learath2> We run it on one server, it seems fine, 1 year later turns out it breaks some map that is played very little and also breaks teehistorian reproduction
15:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1361691274708783195/image.png?ex=67ffad52&is=67fe5bd2&hm=b11307990d7d999e237a522dcbf44fd728184f17d3df290bed9ca041654a21f7&
15:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is there not a teehistorian replay of every official ddnet map
15:16 < bridge> <learath2> I might take a look at it later this week but I will make 0 promises that I'll be merging it
15:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> .~.
15:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i wish u the best of luck
15:24 < bridge> <learath2> #8441 has a very uphill battle to be merged tbh, heinrich needed evidence and Tater's position on it was that other games do it
15:24 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8441
16:46 < bridge> <learath2> `2b542f3f-e8a1-42c4-b0a2-55b667cb2979.teehistorian: Teehistorian(Item(UnknownType(-14)))`
16:46 < bridge> <learath2> More teehistorian oddities
17:29 < bridge> <learath2> ```

17:29 < bridge> <learath2> ```
17:29 < bridge> <learath2> Even more, I wonder how this ever happens even
17:29 < bridge> <learath2> Has to be some sort of failed write or cosmic ray or something
18:15 < bridge> <kebscs> github copilot in vs kinda nice
18:16 < bridge> <louis> ye sometimes its rly annoying if u use autocompletion tho
18:16 < bridge> <kebscs> like a real autocompletion?
18:16 < bridge> <kebscs> seemed to be fine with tab to complete
19:12 < bridge> <Assa> can you ask Copilot to refactor a complex function (successfully)?
19:15 < bridge> <A Moderator> define "complex"
19:15 < bridge> <A Moderator> if you just blindly accept any sort of autocompletion, probably not
19:15 < bridge> <A Moderator> it did help me write a lot of pseudo code before tho
19:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its a cardinal sin that i cant play without lag on solo or /team with dummy since in theory i could just send all inputs with repeats 2 minutes later
19:17 < bridge> <always> could it be used for cheating?
19:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> replay botting can only be done well in good network conditions i pressume
19:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this would make that untrue
19:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cheaters ruin everything
19:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just like... i dont care about your good time, even if it is legit i dont keep track of it, youre just ruining the game for everyone else
19:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ):<
19:19 < bridge> <gorp_tw> bun is mad
19:21 < bridge> <always> bunbunbunbunbun
19:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yes i am mad
19:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cheaters suck
19:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> go touch grass
19:34 < bridge> <kebscs> Not sure what you mean, also just started using it
19:35 < bridge> <kebscs> But other Ai, I've used chatgpt/deepseek and you can ask him what can be reactored or what are some good practices you can apply and it should tell you
19:35 < bridge> <kebscs> I wouldn't trust ai's refactoring as a whole
19:36 < bridge> <kebscs> Taking advice, asking about parts of code that doesn't require much context is generally fine

19:44 < bridge> <robyt3> The question might at least be valid, but the answer is just that I used getters there for encapsulation. The getter can't be const because the caller of this function should call non-const function on it. Stats members are all public because caller is supposed to modify them and adding a getter and setter for every variable is not useful.
19:44 < bridge> <Assa> yeah I asked AI what to do and it's generated code was bs and it's advises not helpful
19:45 < bridge> <Assa> thought it was either an issue of missing specialization of chatgpt or that the AI was bad for this usecase in general
19:46 < bridge> <robyt3> Also, there is a getter but no setter for `std::vector<CSkinListEntry>`. If the member was public you could replace the entire variable variable.

19:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is `...Skins() = ...` not valid?
19:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (or .clear(), then add everything from your new one)
19:47 < bridge> <robyt3> I've have no idea if that's legal, but I don't think I would accept it in a review
19:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> it does appear to be legal
19:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> are all the nocases okay?
19:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and whats the point of this

19:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `x_` is not utf8
19:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and this searches the whole string
19:55 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and now X_SPEC is also a special skin
19:58 < bridge> <Assa> @robyt3 my PR is ready again, should be fine now :owo:
20:00 < bridge> <robyt3> As it should. Not all filesystems are case sensitive so`x_spec` and `X_SPEC` were already the same skin for some players.

20:00 < bridge> <kebscs> The more you ask it, the more it hallucinates
20:01 < bridge> <robyt3> It only checks if the string starts with the prefix though. But I didn't want to add another function to check for a UTF-8 prefix more efficiently.
20:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> It doesn't need to be utf8 does it?
20:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> It only checks the first part if it matches
20:15 < bridge> <robyt3> Assuming there are no other upper base X characters that map to the same lower case :justatest:
20:15 < bridge> <robyt3> But you are probably right, maybe I just did it for consistency

20:17 < bridge> <kebscs> @robyt3 could you merge #10036
20:17 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10036
20:17 < bridge> <kebscs> idk why only approved
20:19 < bridge> <robyt3> I approve and don't merge immediately to let others chime in
20:20 < bridge> <kebscs> theres not enough mainatiners, noone else chimes in
20:20 < bridge> <robyt3> But 1-2 weeks without complaints are enough for me, and it's only changing prediction so no need to share the blame :greenthing:
20:21 < bridge> <kebscs> and #1000 #9902?
20:21 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1000
20:21 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9902
20:21 < bridge> <kebscs> this are only demo's prediction
20:21 < bridge> <kebscs> and #10000 #9902?
20:21 < bridge> <kebscs> 10000, not 1000
20:24 < bridge> <kebscs> or laser door prediction
20:42 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> @alw5 lmfao
20:42 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> y'all insane
20:43 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> i was wondering that you we're joking about this

20:45 < bridge> <kebscs> why?
20:45 < bridge> <kebscs> its not bad
20:45 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> my pr's got rejected like
20:45 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> 100500 times
20:46 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> so i lost all the motivation pr in ddnet
20:46 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> well wp in fixing my code i suppose @alw5
20:47 < bridge> <always> yea
20:47 < bridge> <always> lotta fixes needed
20:48 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @stormaxd make editor prs
20:48 < bridge> <soulyvevo> 0% decline rate i swear
20:48 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> i try one
20:48 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> if reject
20:48 < bridge> <soulyvevo> +you will make me happy which is really important
20:48 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> i'll leave the ddnet

20:48 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> bet
20:49 < bridge> <always> souly happy = good day
20:50 < bridge> <soulyvevo> making me happy is one of the objectives of this game
20:50 < bridge> <soulyvevo> along with finishing the maps and getting points
22:17 < bridge> <hectavoxel> which one r u gonna try
22:18 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> there's a lot of thing in editor which is bugged hell
22:21 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> Alr matter asf question, which is the safest way to save config files?
22:21 < bridge> <StormA, Sovereign of chilling> crypt?
