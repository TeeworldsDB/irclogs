09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You wouldn't believe how much android devices contact google...
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My dads iphone is completely silent on the network when not in use. My samsung calls home like every minute
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> They even contact google to check if the device is online. When I was in China my phone always thought it had no internet, since Google servers are all blocked ðŸ˜„
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a little surprising to me that the iphone is so conservative with it's tracking
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly dont think it has much if any at all
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think that's one of the main selling points, that Apple protects your privacy
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what phone government agencies with very strict rules get
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Learath2 I have total of 108702 trackers blocked since 29.12.2019, 10:00 untill now
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^^
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I doubt it'd be acceptable to jog around langley with an s9 reporting your location every minute
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Soreu a pihole?
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 See also the secret American military bases you can easily see on Strava's heatmap
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> AdGuard set as own VPN to block ads & trackers
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen didn't that get those devices banned from military installations?

09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Blocked Ads
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Blocked trackers
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Blocked threats
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Saved data
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of setting up a pihole on my vpn
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I'm wondering whether I should look into an iphone again
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I get super-frustrated every time I try to fix something on iPhone
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No real file system for once
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It gets better after you jailbreak
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Way too locked in, can't run your own applications
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, but after jailbreak my banking apps will stop working
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only I could have a nice stock android with all tracking disabled and google pay
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As soon as you disable the boot protection thing to install vanilla android, google pay and most all banking apps just dont want to work
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, I was thinking that if Apple made an Android phone that protects your privacy, I'd probably buy it
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> My current solution is just a custom DNS server on Android
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's kinda scary how much information google collects
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be nice if all this data collection could be regulated a bit but with the average politician being a 100 yo, it's unlikely they even understand the concept
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761127741117431838/Screenshot_2020-10-01-09-29-43-725_com.adguard.android.jpg
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> all when just chilling in discord without clicking a single link, and having only Spotify without ads in the bg
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do you run the dns server on the device?
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Soreu you have a xiaomi?
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> y
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Heard those even call home all the way back to china
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 no, currently just NextDNS, so I'm not even running it myself
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I have their smart light bulb, to turn it on thru WiFi the info goes to Chinese servers first, then back to the bulb xD
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, also I'm about to board my first flight since the world went to shit :D
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I always wanted to do some smart home stuff, but it's all so proprietary
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I'm using xiaomi since it's just cheapest one with still decent features/quality
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 where are you flying? have a good trip
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm actually in the office at work for the first time today since the middle of march ðŸ™‚
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> though some Chinese kids know when I'm back home with data going all the way though their servers first xd
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was considering wiring it up myself, but it's not exactly trivial to fit a relay where a light switch used to be and the light switch
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen back to italy
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen was it actually needed that you go back in? Thought your job would be okay with you being remote
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Airports feel so dead. I can't imagine the millions of dollars they are all wasting
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Have a nice flight & chill at workplace
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I gotta start taking care of huge pile of overdue documents at my desk at work xd
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That sounds very boring, have fun :D
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not really required, but a new colleague starts today and I'm his mentor. So it's nice to meet him in person
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Most of it is fixing mistakes of other ppl and so checking every single line xd
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> indeed boring af
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Try to have fun anyway? :D
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761130717241278504/IMG_20201001_094128.jpg
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> call backup pls
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Even thinking of going thru all of it makes me wanna cry & laugh at the same time, but thankfully I'm closer to the second option
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> but for real, never every before got even half of what is laying there right now so I'm wondering what the hell has happened
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Send half i'll do them
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> so... till later ðŸ‘‹
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looks interesting. I wonder how it works with C/C++
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, let's just enable and give it a try. We use Coverity at work, I imagine this to be similar
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen well first of all I guess it couldn't figure out how to build our project :D
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> @Learath2 Hey, i know someone who
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> has his skins folder getting reset or smth ?
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> he is on steam
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> and for some reasons the skins just dont stay
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If he is replacing skins in the data folder, those get deleted with updates
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If he is only adding skins, they shouldnt get reset
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though in general all custom data should go in the config directory
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (which we'll start warning users about in the next patch)
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> he's only adding skins
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One thing I'm not sure of is how steam manages the folders, maybe it is cleaning out extras on update
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ask him when they get reset, if it's on update it could be expected
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He should add his skins to the config directory anyway
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Neben> @Learath2 alright thanks!
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > I always wanted to do some smart home stuff, but it's all so proprietary
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> the world needs an OpenWRT of the IOT that will free those proprietary devices @Learath2
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I hope someone will make an open platform compatible with most chipsets used in modern "smart" home applicances
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've bought a Wi-Fi extender from Xiaomi once just to have a better range for my drone.
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Has to ~~sell my newborn baby~~ register at their website, install application that requires ALL the permissions possible just to tell this extender a W-Fi SSID and a password of my drone. And to do that I need to use webui on chinese site. To literally login into device in my own hands.
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Next time I've bought a Xiaomi router it was the same. There were even no web ui. So chinese servers UI store my router's SSH password to provide me access. Happily there was an OpenWRT so after gaining access I was able to reflash it.
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *to reflash it to OpenWRT and I've never need Xiaomi app or account. Thanks gods, privacy is not so much eroded yet in non-Chinese world and we have alternative manufacturers which don't need 24/7 access to devices in my home for them to work.
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I'd better pay 20-30% more for non as sleeky-looking device than buy a device which will require me full access to my home network and my phone to gain access to a $10 dongle.
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> *again
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ||Sorry for mistakes. Trying my best not to edit my messages in this bridged channel||
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Am in Italy, didn't get arrested at the border
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Problem with smart home stuff is that there usually is open source software that manages them, but they all communicate over proprietary apis. So the open source manager usually ends up a jumble of reverse engineered plugins to interact witb different things
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Am in Italy, didn't get arrested at the border
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 welcome back to the ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> EU funfact: Croatia is the only member country to not have a burgundy passport
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @Pure_luck "Wi-Fi extender from Xiaomi" ðŸ˜¦
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> WiFi extender makes more problems than it actually solves
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> and Xiaomi... the only thing that's worse than Xiaomi are those unknown Chinese trash brands
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> why do people still buy these things... ðŸ˜„
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> if you want some cheap network device at home, go for TP-LINK
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> if you want something better but still quite cheap go for MikroTik or Ubiquiti
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it's really that simple
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Li N> I use TP-LINK's adapters, they work >)
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ubiquiti is pretty darn proprietary too
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Something akin to a consumer cisco
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes, but it works at least without sending all your data to chinese servers ðŸ˜„
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > WiFi extender makes more problems than it actually solves
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've used it to get more range for my Ryzen Tello drone. And it's extended range 5x.
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I don't use extenders at home. If I had a problem I'd used something like mesh for that.
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> by the way, i thought you were concerned about privacy issues - you were afraid of IME
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> that makes sense actually, but then you go and buy some Xiaomi thing
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But it's running OpenWRT now
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I mean the router
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and I use extender in the fields only
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and I use extender in the fields only, it is connected to my drone Wi-Fi AP with no internet access
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and I use the extender literally in the fields only, it is connected to my drone Wi-Fi AP with no internet access
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But I was very upset I have to install app to my phone to be able to login to my router and to reflash it.
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've used virtual android on PC for that ðŸ˜„
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> nice ðŸ˜„
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but still Xiaomi knows my phone number now and that it's connected with my router mac address
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> though they don't have any other info
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But I didn't knew that I will have to do so much extra work to reflash that damn thing.
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I just knew it's possible to install OpenWRT there.
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Next time I would use flasher for that. Much less hassle. But I didn't had one atm.
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> a hardware one
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And I didn't expected that WiFi extender to be that ~~sophisticated~~ overcomplicated.
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> what if it even doesn't have standalone SPI flash rom chip? ðŸ˜„
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Come on, it's usual electronics. It has JTAG and also usual flash memory chips.
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> One way or another it'd be easy to flash it.
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I mean it's not apple (yet).
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Well at least they don't have electronics designed for them.
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> In contrast TP-Link router I've bought later is Chinese too. But it was very regular. Only web ui and fully open for anything.
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> if they make millions of these things, it's possible that it has only that black epoxide spot inside with everything integrated in it
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Epoxide is not nice for nanometer-sized electronics that tend to be overheating.
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It'd died rather quickly.
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's ok for calculators and such.
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> everything is OK if you want to keep price as low as possible ðŸ˜„
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> But nobody will buy a router with 1 month guarantee.
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> at least 2 years are needed
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've had 2 routers that worked for 10 years.
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Both were asus.
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've fixed capacitors 4 times on each. Still working.
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> No IC degradation at all.
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 4 capacitors dying in just 10 years doesn't sound so great
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think it's not only capacitors but something else. As first 5 years they worked with no problem.
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> sometimes it's hard to get good capacitors ðŸ˜„
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So I've fixed both on 5, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10 mark.
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I only had these problems with hardware from the 2000s: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yeah I think my capacitors were getting worse.
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> aftewards no dead caps
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and manufactorer used better ones
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> they lasted 5 years which is nice
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> mine lasted 1-2 but costed me like 0.2$ each
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> also 20 minutes of labor too
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> now those routers are pretty useless anyway, right?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Yes, as I've bought a Xiaomi and TP-Link ones with better Wifi ac number
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've loved those little routeres
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> especially amber backlight on WL-500g ðŸ˜„
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> single antenna only unlike those modern monsters with 4 and more antennas ðŸ˜„
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761231317387444304/614_asus_rt-n16_wl-500gp_wl-500gx_1.png
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Exactly my 2 precious routers (top two)
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> found on the internets
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> that looks like orange, but in fact is amber
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> looked very warm ðŸ˜„
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> also I think I will reuse their enclosure for something
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/761231556320690196/a5a39587b411b72e970c9e05777eb5ce.png
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's really nicely designed and RPi fits there or even 2 of them
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> WiFi module can be replaced ðŸ˜®
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yeah!
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but I didn't bothered
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I am using wifi only for mobile
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> there are no modern WiFi cards with miniPCI (not PCIe) anyway
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think there are m2 ones
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> which could be compatible with a mechanical convertor
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but you'd better to check that
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> what are those additional wires? serial console hack? ðŸ˜„
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> that's not my photo
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but that could be GPIO pins
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> so maybe it's for serial
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> or for IOT
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> this router doesn't much different from RPi in it's core
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> same chip I believe
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> at least in RT-16
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> at least it's ARM too and have linux and plenty of GPIO
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> if you want to solder them
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> RPi has more powerful processor and much more RAM probably
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> even the oldest one
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> even not so old TP-LINKs have only 32 MB of RAM
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> you're right
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> No, modern routeres have much more power and mem
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes they do
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > It is powered by Qualcomm Atheros QCA9558 @ 720 MHz chipset, 128 MB RAM and 8 MB flash.
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> This is my current one
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's dual core I believe
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Though I've thought it has 1 GB of RAM
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> weird
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> sometimes it has even USB port, so you that little flash storage can be extended
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> sometimes it has even USB port, so that little flash storage can be extended
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Never bought a router w/o USB in my life
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Used every one with USB hard disk as a home file storage
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and one router as a video monitoring system
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it must be super slow as file server, or no?
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> it's much slower than SATA ofc
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but it doesn't makes a difference for achiving/backuping for example
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> my home network is gigabit now and it's 1/6 of maximum theoretical SATA 3.0 speed
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> which is very fast
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and dual core 720 Mhz CPU is more than enough for that
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and I use cheap old HDD's not SSD for a file storage
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> and I use cheap old HDD's not SSD for a file storage, so HDD speed is right ~1 Gbps
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> your router has USB 3.x port?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> USB 2.0 with its theoretical 480 Mbps is quite slow for gigabit network
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> you're right it doesn't
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Xiaomi one had it
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I rarely use it for anything but backups though
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> there was an Asus router with 2.5" HDD drive bay inside
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> maybe it had even native SATA
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> yeah
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've wanted that
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Also Xiaomi Pro has internal SATA I believe
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> ARM SoC with native SATA is quite rare thing, so let's hope it doesn't use some slow USB2-to-SATA converter ðŸ˜„
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> like many ARM boards out there with few exceptions
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I think I've read an in-depth review of Xiaomi router Pro and there was no convertor
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but I am aware that usually there are USB2.0 convertors inside
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pak> I think the voting system to kick/ban someone should be changed. Atleast the kick voting. Since the people are spread out quite alot in the maps, a blocker/teamkiller or troll rarely gets kicked out. Imo there should be less votes required
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> then it will be easier to abuse
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xyloae> Then fun voting will be a bigger problem :justatest:
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> @Pak you should ping moderators here, if you need help
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> if auth system were introduced it would be easy to set a weight for an authed player to 2 and also track funvoters
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> if auth system would/ introduced it would be easy to set a weight for an authed player to 2 and also track funvoters
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> authed players can force vote
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlySlime> if possible, tees that are close to the person being kicked can have 2x effect on the vote system or something.
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlySlime> i agree that a blocker/teamkiller rarely gets kicked out
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlySlime> i agree that a blocker/teamkiller rarely gets kicked out - it is a problem
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats not a bad idea
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but would it be based on distance or time bcs i think there are some maps that loop back around on themselves
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlySlime> still a new player haha, so not that experienced. but sure ðŸ˜„
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Damn, been away too long

20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> damn those bezels are small
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I researched a lot before getting them
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They did kinda cheat though, there is a "bezel" on the panel itself, pixels that are not real pixels, just black
