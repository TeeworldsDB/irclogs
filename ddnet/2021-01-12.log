00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> whats the difference in nightly build? (i still have the spikes) i felt the game more tough
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> do u get lagspikes on older clients
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> nightly build just has the new features still in development
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> yes i do
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> then it might not be a problem with the client and rather a problem with your specific computer or your internet
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Krumplee> complete reinstall couldnt solve the spike lags also. its sure now that the problem is in my pc
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i found the source of my subtly stuttering image
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i capped `cl_refresh_rate` to 300 (for my 144 hz monitor)
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i now have it at 500 and my image is smooth
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> dont think that this is how it should be though
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1921 wow i even already had an issue for this were i said that i have it at 500, apparently set it to 300 at some point o.o
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> #1921
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1921
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for smooth gameplay make it 0
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> better only cap gfx_refresh_rate
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, 0 is also the default because these slight stutterings are annoying and hard to track down
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah yeah i meant `gfx_refresh_rate`
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gfx_asyncrenderold or smth like that on?
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe ur GPU doesnt like swapping between throttling and fullspeed
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> `gfx_asyncrenderold` was on for me, though switching it off didnt seem to do much
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that should be on
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we only renamed it because the old gfx_asyncrender defaulted to 0, but setting it to 1 is better
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah true 😄
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well if you want to find the issue, the best idea is probs to monitor clock speeds temperatures etc
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can we document all the different ways of throttling and it's effects?
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> People ask me about this stuff all the time and I keep telling them I have no idea
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A framerate cap that's well above the monitor refresh rate should never ever cause stutters
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we have like 4 different settings that essentially throttle the game in some way
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I am interested in getting the game to run more smoothly on old underpowered hardware. Any specific settings that make a notable difference?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> a better pc
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> What is the problem you see
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> @YupHio check your graphic settings
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 depends heavily on what u call stutter, but stutter can also be caused by hardware even if u only have 10 fps
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @YupHio what hardware
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if it supports GL 3.3 already u can enable that
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> turn on entities
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I disagree. If the internal framerate is not synced to the monitor framerate, then you will render some frames when they are quite old, others fresh, so it will stutter
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should at most get a doubled frame every once in a while, not large stutters tho, no?
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> So, vsync on then?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, should be microstutters
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Personally I've always played with vsync, yes. But some vsync implementations add lots of delay, which is even worse.
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on windows
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> linux doesnt have vsync
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, I have a vsync setting on Linux and it does what it's supposed to
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> @YupHio show us your graphic settings
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its still not the same
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on linux its more a flush
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on windows its actually waiting
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> As an example of polling frequency way over the hz of the monitor mattering: https://youtu.be/gOQNRvJbpmk?t=537

14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> cheap 9 years old laptop with no graphics card, 6gb of slow old RAM, and a slow asf HDD
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I get minor stuttering on feature-rich maps, like that novice sunny-side map with all the moving quads and music etc
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @YupHio how many fps you get?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> let me baseline that real quick
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and try enabling OpenGL 3
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> you could try turning of texts on maps just amke sure u read  everyhting beforehand incase it explains how to do a step, you can turn it off with PageUp buton
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> turn on entities
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> turn off health and score hud
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> press "Page Up" on ur keyboard, or in ddnet settings make the overlay entities fully right or left
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Sunny Side Up map actually was 150+ FPS so that's not a good baseline, but also the server was empty which may have an effect. I tried turning on vsync but immediately noticed a slight delay when hooking stuff.
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Sounds good, I will try all that. Thanks guys
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Don't use /showall
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is no text (except the chat) that is rendered as text(except gl 1.x)
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <KaipTataPasake> i mean the backgroudn goes dark and every text (name of map on start, little words) alll of that disapeasrs
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> entities
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u mean disabling the design or what 😄
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Ok I enabled OpenGL 3.3, unchecked "Use high DPI", turned off score and healthbar in the HUD, put overlay entities slider to off, and turned off text entities.
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> 
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Now I am getting 500-800 FPS depending on the map. Night and day difference
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Also I turned off high detail
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw the slight delay with vsync is usually so very slight that it isn’t much of a disadvantage, it’s something you can get used to within a day or two
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well it makes the frames litteraly wait to e.g. 16ms per frame for 60hertz
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> + all ur other input delays = rip
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You would be surprised at how much delay your brain can just delete
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> delay is delay
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> doesnt matter if ur brain can recalculate it
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So? If you can’t perceive it it’s a non issue
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u cant predict the future
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> end of discussion
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol, I love discussing things with you, it makes me want to take a swig of bleach
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is no discussion
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its a fact
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont discuss about facts
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you know that it’s one of the greatest evolutionary advantages humans had over other competing species?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We are usually very good at predicting the future compared to fishes
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i bet any wild animal would be better in reflex based games than us
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I played quite fine at 90ms ping with vsync, it’s just a matter of getting used to. Even 200ms you can tolerate as long as your partner isn’t moving around in a stupid manner
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but u dont want to be the best, thats the difference
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fine play with screen tearing, use a crt for all I care lol
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> at 1000fps and high refresh rate monitor u almost dont see it
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 95% of people are casuals, and as a member of the homo sapiens species they possess the ability to tolerate small delays in the order of miliseconds. Most people I know prefer playing without screen tearing and don’t own high refresh rate monitors
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when somebody askes for best experience, i tell them how to get best experience
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and not how to make ur laptop stay cool
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol, ok. I’ll be triple checking your every contribution from now on for performance hogs
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> im fine with that
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This game is supposed to run on toasters, we’ve already strayed so far from that and I have a feeling you’d be okay with going even further
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i'd say the opposite
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ddnet 10 runs like shit
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @YupHio wait, what made the large difference? Was it OpenGL 3 or High DPI? or something else?
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> while 15 runs much better
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Tell that to all the people who get much worse performance like @noby (or anyone else on macOS)
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he gets better performance
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> actually its not "much" worse anymore, but its still worse
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ddnet 10 is my fav
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he just doesnt like his fans
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so caps his fps
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh sorry, I forgot we should be using 100% of the cpu and gpu for or AAA title, lol
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its not my fault macos doesnt like anything
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vulkan, opengl
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i use the same fps cap of 600 on cl refresh/gfx refresh
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> on both versions
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @noby i already told ya
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the highdpi fix really did remove 90% of the problem
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the calculation changed and its not the same
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but i still feel like version 10 is smoother
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im not talking about teh fps in the corner
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i know thats changed
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not only that
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u type cl_refresh_rate 480 on ddnet 10
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its not <480 fps
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby if you disable highdpi the curved buttons look like shit
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs it was buggy
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ofc reducing the resolution improves performance
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> learath ik but my fps is noticeably higher and it feels better to play on and it makes the fans shutoff so id gladly take those 3 advantages over slightly worse looking buttons and text
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> plus it looks fine to me anyway, wouldnt describe it as looking like shit lol
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How was it with ddnet10? Atleast on my macbook that doesn’t use 200% of my cpu and lets me render in full res
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (though I do need to patch it a bit to get it to render at full res)
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im using an external monitor rn which decreases fps but its only using 20%cpu or less and its good fps
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For the record, I can run ddnet10 without throttling even. Without throttling (and out of the box on steam) the current patch makes my mac a toaster oven
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But ofc, it’s never our fault. Every other game runs just fine, but it’s obviously not our fault
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> aslong it outputs more fps i dont see something bad
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> >= fps
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rest is just config
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really love how console games handle this, there should always be a target fps
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just rendering a bajillion fps using the entire cpu and the gpu is just an insane proposition, doing it out of the box even more so
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well depends
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> best out of box experience sounds good to me
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rest is config
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, as always, you know best. I don’t even know why I ever talk about any subject as none of you here respect my opinion as much as a doormats opinion on any subject except maybe heinrich 😛
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is no perfect default
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we talked like 2 times
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not my fault that i just think in facts these 2 times
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vsync off master race
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i have high refresh rate monitor and i can set it to 60hz with vsync
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah you just present your opinion as fact and say facts need no discussion
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so can i judge on both
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Would definitely be best if we can get good performance without 100% CPU/GPU utilization by default
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also i play this game much more
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i can also judge there more
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt use 100% on mine
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz 100% would mean using all cores i guess
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt use 100% cpu, it uses 1 core fully
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and the graphic thread as much it gets
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats how it hsould be
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> games are ur primary focus
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when u play
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my gpu doesnt even reach 100%
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs my cpu is too slow
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The burden of proof is on the one with extraordinary claims, so you need to show how you start from your claim and get to a fundamental truth. You can’t just say it’s fact without any support for it
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Immigration is bad. It’s fact
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There let’s deport every immigrant, no discussion needed it’s just fact
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i just dont care, i played this game so much, i know what i like, and if somebody wants best experience, he wants atleast what i would say is best experience or better
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a fact ppl disable vsync for any competitive game
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in csgo they also dont cap
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs they want their 300fps
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i use cl_refresh_rate 600; gfx_refresh_rate 600; gfx_vsync 0
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and it works well for me on both clients i guess
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ddnet 10 gives slightly hgiher fps
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the cap of 600 in ddnet10 is not the same in ddnet 11+
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ddnet 11-13 was fcky for me
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well u use mac
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its ur fault
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I argued that it doesn’t matter. Argumentum ad populum is just weak
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes many people do it
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no u
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its not my fault if old versions work better than new versions
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u might be able to say its my fault if no versions work correctly
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think thats true
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does that make it correct? Many people smear yoghurt on themselves in turkey as a cure to sunburns. Are they correct?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the definition of vsync means delay
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is not a belief
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> vsync is bad
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its math
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> feels shitty to play with
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Delay is bad is a belief
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?????
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think we can all agree that reducing delay is better 😄
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well before we destroy our teeworlds experience we could destroy bitcoin
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats more energy waste
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bitcoin will grow  cuz now the big holders went in
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they expect it to reach 150k
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s almost imperceivable. Do you notice the text input delay introduced by the X Server?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> people notice it
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can certainly feel the delay introduced by vsync
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i do
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u cant see it
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> specially on 3d games
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but u can feel it when u play
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on ddnet u notice the mouse delay
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i know for a fact because it feels like i accidentally toggled antiping off when i try to play after forgetting to disable vsync
15:47 <+ChillerDragon> oof almost forgot to backup etc/hosts and my ssh key any other places i could search files before wiping my harddrive? 
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> search .config/
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and most importantly
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur vimrc
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the sacred file
15:47 <+ChillerDragon> vimrc is on git :)
15:47 <+ChillerDragon> found 1 in .config/
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make sure to backup any gpg key u have
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Easy solution, back everything up, check what you needl ater
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> hmm
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> smart
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it shouldnt take much space
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> 900gb of hentai
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would ignore stuff like node_modules
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that shit is always big and so many files
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> ye
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> i think ill risk it to not backup everything cuz its mostly trash and idk where to put it
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> i should have ervything now yikes
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wipe the hdd to clear all traces of chillerbot and other malicious software
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In the endless pursuit of more and more fps we have lost our sight of the real goal. You want the screen to render a new frame every single refresh, nothing more
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> oof :robot:
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> btw i dont care about much more than 1000 fps, my gpu can do around 10k
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u will definitly forget something
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i also capped it
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but the CPU cap is killer
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> also the fact that new copies of ddnet open like 3 random blank windows behind it
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is very annoying
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> on a small screen
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i even notice it when i set it to 1000 or more
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @noby thats macos stuff
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont care
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on my linux its clean
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It’s also an sdl bug iirc
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its new ddnet stuff
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> old ddnet never does that
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I guess. But it’s definitely not our fault
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know how I know that? Because that would imply there is a mistake in something Jupstar wrote
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i could do the bisect thing if yall want
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> me to narrow down the commit that cuases the black windows to appear
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That’s a fundamental contradiction
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can try, I couldn’t reproduce it reliably, so I didn’t bother bisecting
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it happens everytime for me on new ddnet x_x
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when did i wrote sdl code? except ones
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the reason i havent bisected is because certain versions seem to not compile
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and that isnt released yet
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then please do bisect for it
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> will yall help me compile the ones that dont work
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also u cant really trigger me. I do bugs, thats normal, i just try to fix them
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im lazy to debug each error in each versin
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh yeah, you didn’t touch SDL, I guess if you do find a bug we don’t risk the universe collapsing into a blackhole
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean our sdl code
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do u mind reminding me how to bisect :pepeH:
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well first find a version it doesn’t happen in
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> seems to be fine in 12.7.2
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ill try 13x
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 13.2 fine too
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 14.0 fin
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> e
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 15.1.3 not fine
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess that’s close enough. Bisect works in logn steps
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do git bisect good 14.0
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> git bisect bad master
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> okok lemme pull
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh you might need to first do `git bisect start`
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ok i did these cmds now what
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> git bisect bad master
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> Bisecting: 882 revisions left to test after this (roughly 10 steps)
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [2a3b254b4793930a0d19efaf8494a521d6668fca] Merge #2890
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2890
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok now test this revision
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh it already updated ok
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it’s bad you do git bisect bad
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it’s good you do git bisect good
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ok its compiling
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> prepare for errors
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fingers very crossed ;P
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> make sure to do a clean compilation
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> fatal error: too many errors emitted, stopping now [-ferror-limit=]
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> remove the build folder
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> there was no build folder

16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really would love to properly get this fixed but idk who to even annoy about it

16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> uh? xd
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If that doesn’t work you need to grep for sdk in cmakecache, it might be some other sdk overlap not the exact one I have
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> id rather just download precompiled 14.5 or smth to narrow it down more broadly
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ok 14.5.1 works fine
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how do i quit the bisect and start over from that point
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah this is what happens whenever I want someone to debug anything on macOS... I seem to be the only person patient enough to debug xcode internals
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lmao
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> git bisect reset
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ok nowwhat
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `git bisect start && git bisect good 14.5 && git bisect bad master`
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh i just found
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 15.0.5 from site doesnt work
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I honestly am not sure how well you will be able to debug like this
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The version from the site links to one sdl2, you link to another sdl2
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ,_,
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> easier to just use an old version right
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For you yes, but it’s sad that we never get to find these bugs
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i narrowed down the problem is after 14.5.1 and before 15.0.5
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even I with my almost infinite patience couldn’t fix our cmakefile
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh between
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 14.5.1 and 14.7.1
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> actually
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> since .7.1 makes balck windows
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On macOS I can’t get it to link to libraries I want. It always wants to link to the bundled ones
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 14.6.2 makes the error too
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 14.5.1 doesnt
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i cant narrow it down anymore from precompiled
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On macOS two different versions of the sdks includedirs can end up in the compilation line. I even figured out why it happens. I just don’t know how to fix it. I’ve decided cmake is just very meh on macOS
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> bring back bam
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are these both precompiled?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes i went ddnet.tw/downloads
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 14.5.1 no black wndows
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also what are your gfx settings?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> deen update the build stuff and libs
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @noby https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-14.7-osx.dmg
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that is without the patch i think
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/798570008124325888/Screen_Shot_2021-01-12_at_9.11.48_AM.png
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bam is even more confused at this btw, it had 3 versions of the sdk in my linker line
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> rip lol
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @Jupstar ✪ bug
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> have u tried without ffmpeg
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that was probs the biggest change in 14.7
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Compile with the videorecorder option off
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cmake .. -DVIDEORECORDER=OFF
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> compiling doent work
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> too bad
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you paste your cmakecache somewhere?
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m sure I can fix it for you
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> have u tried gfx_opengl_major 1 in newest client @noby ?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe its the gl driver
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or sdl trying to get gl 3.x context
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and just openes alot of windows xD
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wpah wtf
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it worked thx
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice and sad :p
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no more black windows on any version
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sadly you don’t get the 3.3 benefits anymore :/
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if its SDL or the video driver
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs SDL could be fixed
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @noby what does GL 3.3 in version 14 or smth do?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could debug it if I could reliably reproduce it
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or better 12
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do in what sense
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does it also open black screens?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> gfx_opengl_major 1 no
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in ddnet 12 enable gl 3.3 in graphic settings tab
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no i have cl_svae_settings 0
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and see if u get these weird black screens
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how to do it in cfg
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wait gonna see
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gfx_opengl3 1
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ok
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no windows in 12
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> alright
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or in 15
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not even in 15 or what?
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i hope its in 15
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else its no SDL bug xd
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> gfx_opengl_major 1 fixed it for all versions
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> opengl3 made no difference
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cus it was already fixed
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in 15.x u need to use gfx_opengl_major 3; gfx_opengl_minor 3
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs we allow different gl versions now
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mean what is the diference ingame
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean for the windows
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ingame it gives more fps if ur driver isnt bad
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it lowers CPU time basically
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it wont give more fps if ur GPU is the limiting factor 😄
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> those settings on ddnet 15 actually make it better 👀
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nice
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Jupstar ✪ would it be possible to only start rendering like 3 frames before the screen is ready to accept one?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> accept what?
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a new frame, idk if you can get this info somehow
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> without vsync it will probs replace half of the buffer of ur monitor
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (or any devisor)
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it also sends chunks or smth and if u get new input it just sends that
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> offscreen it can theoretically render anything
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> double buffering is doing that basically, and the driver decides if it uses the content or not
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do we do double buffering?
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but probs the driver even does tripple buffering
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it can swap two offscreen buffers
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and has one "ready" buffer
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can we somehow know when the driver uses the new buffer?
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not in release mode atleast xD
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe there are extension for amd and nvidia dunno
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, too bad
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can disable double buffering
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and u can also always render on the main buffer directly, gut there is no garantuee the driver actually does it
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or just lets u think that u do it
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this was just an idea to reduce the unlimited frame rate we have to something sane
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> without increasing input lag
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gpu isnt the problem
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if we can't know when the driver will swap the buffers, that doesn't sound possible
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its the mouse input mostly
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the main thread is too busy and has to create all rendercalls
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is no visualisation / simulation difference
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the main thread has to create everything
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it would be possible by rewritting teeworlds
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't follow. the problem is that we get a 16ms old mouse input with something like vsync because we render the frame 16ms early, right?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> example:
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cpu renders no frame
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> goes into sleep
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but 1 nanosecond later it could have rendered the frame
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it wakes up some point
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> has todo the simulation
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> has to prepare rendercalls
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> => delay
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you might be able to use the FPS (if its stable enough) to predict when to wake up
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its probs never 100% reliable
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, not 100% reliable
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (oh and maybe to get it right, it sleeps long)
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs it had less todo in that frame without a rendercall
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if you wake up 3 frames early, it should be quite reliable, no?
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 3 frame times early
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well depends on what ur target fps is probably 😄
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm?
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> say I have a monitor with 60 or 144fps
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but there is more to it anyway, it also fetches the mouse relative state from SDL it doesnt use global mouse state
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then teeworlds would render 180fps or ~450fps
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i understand what u want
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but not 1800 or so, wasting energy, battery, etc.
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> kk
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you mean we could wake up more often to fetch mouse input but not render?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it already does it if u dont limit gfx
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or do u mean without any simulation?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just the mouse
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, just the mouse
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> could work, but i dunno if it works 😄
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in the end its more about semi state
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wait
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean like
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u are lucky to either hit the exact moment u want to draw a frame or not
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u wake up at some point u still have todo the simulation
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but that's no different with unlimited fps
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we just need to make sure we're continuously rendering frames around the point where it's important
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, let me rephrase what I want to do, it seems to me that you're not quite saying the same thing as I do
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the way "unlimited fps" helps reduce input lag is that it continuously renders new frames, so it also renders a new frame just before the graphics driver swaps the output buffer
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we're wasting a lot of renders that we basically know won't get displayed anyway, namely right after that swap, we know that there won't be any more swaps for 16ms
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so if we knew the moment of the swap, we could pause our rendering until just a couple of frame times before the next swap, rendering a couple of times until the swap comes and then pausing again
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats not true tho
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there are more swaps
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else tearing wouldnt occour
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this would, in my understanding, lead to the exact same input lag as "unlimited fps"
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tearing occurs when we render to a buffer that is swapped while we're rendering to it
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not talking about tearing or solutions to tearing
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm talking about the same setup we have for "unlimited fps" but reducing the amount of renders we do
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but for a non constant fps i already said the same as u
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> here
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that's wrong, no?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just because we gave the driver a new frame doesn't mean it will put it on the screen immediately
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well u could substrace the time it requires for the simulation part
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> a fps on simulation part basically
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there might still be time to render another frame
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it should without vsync
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it just updates the current stream to monitor
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ur hdmi cable doesnt have instant bandwidth xd
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I understand that
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I need to draw pictures, I don't think we're on the same page
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u want to swait for the swap and then start the new frame?
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but using 180fps on 60hz doesnt fix issues
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's vsync, in my understanding
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs in worst case u have 1000/180 delay
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think I really have not made myself clear enough
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 1000/180s delay would not happen in my understanding in my model
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not just doing 180fps
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i can only tell ya
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u render the full rendercalls offscreen, and as soon as u swap the buffer it is probably updating internally to the monitor stream
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so its never wasted
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> say we have a 60hz monitor
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then the monitor can only display 60 frames per second
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but that doesnt mean u dont want half images too
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that are "more" updated
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so every frame we render above that is wasted. we might not be able to eliminate that waste because we're not able to predict the future, but it's still wasted
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you're going to tell me something about input delay
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u are litteraly describing vsync xD
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think we're just not talking about the same thing
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you think about it in practical terms, with a specific algorithm in mind
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> namely vsync
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its not wasted, ever
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then you say the extra frames aren't wasted because they help reduce input latency
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they are also displayed on screen
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are they?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just "only" partially
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, thats tearing
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a 60fps monitor can display more than 60fps?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ofc there is no garantuee that absoluty none is wasted
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought tearing happens at a different level
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it can render half of the old frame and half of the new
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> in theory u could also say, ur eyes follow from top left to bottomr ight and it only updates a small potion and then u would have somthing that is more than 60hz on 60hz monitor xd

18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> anyone up 4 an ATH 0.7 rewrite?
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> - xush'
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> no api features for accessing player input this time around >.>
20:06 <+ChillerDragon> @GutZuFuss you can start by helping to update ddnet client to 0.7 :)
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> k lets go
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> where are the whitespaces i should delete
20:07 <+ChillerDragon> haha
20:07 <+ChillerDragon> the skin system is probably a nasty one 
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> Would someone mind to approve my refactoring backport from 0.7?
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3502
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Kaffeine we don't always review same-day, you'll need some patience
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we still appreciate cleanups and other contributions
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I don't force anyone 🙂
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> 
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> The ask for "0.7 refactoring" CR supposed to be in the context of "anyone up 4 an ATH 0.7 rewrite?" and "you can start by helping to update ddnet client to 0.7 🙂"
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaffeine> I consider "helping to update ddnet client to 0.7" to include "review 0.7 backports".
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Or update 0.7 to our skin system @ChillerDragon
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GutZuFusss> so no whitespaces i can remove? bummer
