08:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @kollpotato: is your code already published?
09:25 < bridge> <louis> why does the zoom level change when spectating someone?
09:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> are They zooming in and out?
09:45 < bridge> <louis> does spectating someone clone their zoom?
09:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I just spectated my dummy and it didn't zoom in, so probably ye
10:37 < bridge> <cellegenrih> wait a minute, I didn't know Quads are used with fragment shaders
10:41 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You gotta shade your fragments!
10:42 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Ohhh, embedding shaders in maps seems like a gloriously bad idea
10:50 < bridge> <louis> the new spectate zoom stuff is buggy, if i spectate myself i suddenly switch to a different zoom when i unspectate which makes no sense
10:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I never considered, that maybe this is why quads are more costly to use than tiles
10:56 < bridge> <cellegenrih> aren't there any better ways to transform a texture's 4 end points or rather use polygon shapes to visualize a texture without relying on the GPU to do it? xd
10:58 < bridge> <totar> All drawing is done on the gpu
10:59 < bridge> <totar> You can't draw textures without some kind of fragment shader
11:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> i didn't think someone would say the most obvious shit ever
11:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> what I wanted to point out originally, is that this fragment shader used for all of the Quads are determining the entirety of the transform, which should be done on the CPU anyway, letting the GPU process that shit as well
11:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> meaning, the more quads you flood into the GPU, the worse performance you get: exponentially. meaning the performance decrease will be multiplicative.
11:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> or rather, once the GPU hits a limit on how much it can handle at once, it can drop the game below 60 fps or straight up slow down everything else, only to be able to draw those quads
11:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I thought the end points of a Quad is calculated on the CPU, so that information can be cached and THEN fed into the GPU's memory when it needs it the most
11:05 < bridge> <syrinok> I agree, if you manually zoom out while watching someone, it should keep the zoom level between, it's a bit awkward / clunky having 2 different zoom states @tsfreddie
11:06 < bridge> <totar> which shader are you talking about
11:06 < bridge> <syrinok> And ya, it's a cool new feature, you get to see exactly what people are looking at, as long as they have the latest-ish version
11:06 < bridge> <cellegenrih> fragment shader, which is used by every quad
11:06 < bridge> <totar> which one
11:07 < bridge> <totar> link it
11:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I literally wrote "quad" inside the repo and found both the fragment shader and vertex shader code, which builds up to the Quads we use in the program.
11:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I don't think I need you a guide on how to find it, do I?
11:08 < bridge> <totar> there is no transformation happening in the "quad" shader
11:08 < bridge> <totar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/data/shader/quad.frag
11:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> but since someone is not that familiar with it's own ripo, it's inside data/shaders
11:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> you're welcome
11:09 < bridge> <totar> doing a texture fetch at all which is required to draw the texture is likely ~100x more expensive than moving the quad points
11:09 < bridge> <totar> but it does not do that
11:09 < bridge> <cellegenrih> even if it does it every single frame?
11:10 < bridge> <totar> but it does not do that anyway
11:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> even if it has like hundreds of them at the same time?
11:10 < bridge> <totar> they all need texture fetches as well
11:10 < bridge> <totar> also where are you talking about
11:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> only when it requires it, not whenever a new frame is up
11:10 < bridge> <totar> there is no transformation happening in the fragment shader
11:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I just don't understand how this approach is faster, while it's exponentially slower with larger uses
11:11 < bridge> <totar> the vertex shader is only run once per perfect which makes it about 10,000x cheaper than the fragment shader
11:11 < bridge> <totar> the vertex shader is only run once per vertex which makes it about 10,000x cheaper than the fragment shader
11:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> and I'm talking about the fragment shader, getting transform positions to align colors based on that value, which I think it's not cached
11:13 < bridge> <cellegenrih> regardless of this uninteresting fact, Quads are just way worse at maintaining it's performance or even exceeding a simple tile's or entity's performance in a visual test
11:14 < bridge> <totar> that's because tiles use a special render mode, you cannot use that for quads
11:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I don't wanna implement a faulty Quad system into my own map editor when I see that it performs worse, than it should be
11:14 < bridge> <eidderFsT> zoom now sync to server which also makes it harder to decide what zoom is being sent, what zoom is being used, what zoom is being sent to client for other people. they can all be different values. For example, if you spectable, and zoom out. what other people spectating you sees? If someone give me a exhaustive list of zoom behaviour across {LOCAL_ZOOM, SERVER_ZOOM, SERVER_ZOOM_SENT_TO_OTHERS} * {FREE_VIEW, SPECTATING_OTHERS, PLAYING, SPECTATING_
11:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> for now if you just manually zoom out while spectating to the same level when you are playing. it will stay like that
11:15 < bridge> <syrinok> I'm not nerd enough for that, I can only give you feedback :happy:
11:15 < bridge> <totar> I don't care about the zoom level of the tee I'm spectating it should just be the client's zoom
11:15 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Also, as long as at least 500 quads using HD textures can achieve a limit of 1/60th of a second performance, I'm more than happy to use any approach that is below this requirement
11:15 < bridge> <teero777> @totar gm I slept like ass
11:16 < bridge> <totar> gm
11:16 < bridge> <eidderFsT> the auto spec cam is to make sure the cursor don't just fly out and matches dyncam. we can remove that and just allow cursors to be out of screen for zoomed players
11:16 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you can turn it off just by zooming
11:16 < bridge> <syrinok> I personally disagree, it's good information, you can tell if someone is doing something wrong easier based on the things they can see
11:17 < bridge> <teero777> @totar did you fix your blend mode?
11:17 < bridge> <totar> no I gave up
11:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> In my own map editor, the only way I can achieve this is if I don't transform each individual end point of a mesh, but rather use a 2d rectangle shape to define a Quad and then manipulating the UV only, which in my case can be achieved without making a fragment shader
11:17 < bridge> <totar> the blend mode is not the hard part
11:17 < bridge> <louis> ᶜˡᶦᵉⁿᵗ ˢᵉᵗᵗᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒᵍᵍˡᵉˀ
11:17 < bridge> <louis> i'd prefer not to see people's terrible default zooms
11:17 < bridge> <syrinok> I just don't like how you have to manage 2 different zoom levels in the process, rather than just having an auto feature when you reset
11:17 < bridge> <eidderFsT> I can make spec zoom use client zoom automatically if auto cam is not available
11:17 < bridge> <totar> I don't want the zoom level changes unless I press the zoom binds
11:18 < bridge> <totar> it should just never change imo
11:18 < bridge> <eidderFsT> which is mostly the cases since it is not released
11:18 < bridge> <totar> it should just never change automatically imo
11:18 < bridge> <eidderFsT> actually, i'm in the middle of something else, if someone can make that change it would be great
11:19 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i think you need to remove auto spec cam. or make it a manual turn on. but we don't have cursors and idk what bind to use. client settings maybe but then it would be more confusing to turn it off and on.
11:20 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i think to solve this, we should just remove auto spec cam
11:20 < bridge> <eidderFsT> for now
11:20 < bridge> <totar> why did the zoom need to change at all
11:21 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it's the auto spec cam thing which is turned on and off by zooming or reset zoom. it tries to match what other players sees
11:21 < bridge> <eidderFsT> free view uses client zoom still
11:21 < bridge> <eidderFsT> if it doesn't then it is a bug
11:22 < bridge> <eidderFsT> although currently there is no auto spec cam so it default to a internal spec zoom variable which is indeed adjusted separately
11:22 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i can also just remove spec zoom and if you turn off auto spec cam you change the player zoom too.
11:22 < bridge> <syrinok> It uses default default zoom level if they're using a version below 18090 I think, which is definitely hard to look at
11:23 < bridge> <eidderFsT> true
11:23 < bridge> <eidderFsT> remove the spec zoom value then
11:23 < bridge> <eidderFsT> and just changes client zoom when auto spec cam is turned off, but it'd be harder to tell if player want it on tho
11:23 < bridge> <syrinok> Would it harm the auto feature by doing this
11:25 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i can also just make client zoom matches auto spec cam zoom when exiting spectate, it's like copying other people's zoom settings, and we keep the auto spec cam state too. as long as you turn off auto by zooming out and never press reset zoom when spectating other players it'll match the old behaviour
11:25 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but still, removing auto spec cam might be either
11:25 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but still, removing auto spec cam might be easier
11:27 < bridge> <eidderFsT> OR, we can also just make spec cursor default to off, and auto spec cam would just stop make sense, so we don't use it. if people like having two separate zoom, they can turn spec cursor on.
11:27 < bridge> <eidderFsT> spec cursor is yet to have a menu settings
11:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i mean the original goals is to not change your playing zoom when you spectating, so you always go back to what you have when you resume
11:28 < bridge> <syrinok> I think it benefits new players to have auto work by default, since it allows them to see how good players see the game (changing their default zoom level, the ability to zoom in and out)
11:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> and auto spec cam will change it so i made it separate
11:28 < bridge> <syrinok> I think it's a good feature
11:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> still, sounds like removing auto spec cam is easier
11:29 < bridge> <syrinok> Easier, but I don't think it'd be better for the health of the game
11:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> how about just use client zoom if you self spectate
11:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> if you don't like other people's default zoom then you manually change it
11:30 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it will stay anyway. auto spec cam never turn back on if you specifically do it by resetting or right click
11:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> again, it is quite intensional to make sure you go back to your own zoom when you resume. and you can always change the spec zoom and it will stay like that
11:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it doesn't sound hard to adjust for me but i do know that i don't play enough ddnet tho
11:32 < bridge> <eidderFsT> @louis.place do you have default zoom set or just zoom out every time you start playing
11:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i need to double check the code, maybe i forgot to make spec zoom default to settings
11:35 < bridge> <syrinok> I have my default zoom set to 9, when I spectate players that don't have 18090 it zooms in once to default 10
11:35 < bridge> <eidderFsT> sounds like a bug then
11:35 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i am still in the middle of something tho, i'll try take a look after
11:38 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but are we sure if i just make it spec zoom default to default zoom it will be good?
11:38 < bridge> <eidderFsT> or do i need to match current client zoom
11:43 < bridge> <syrinok> I think the only gripe anyone could have with it, besides it existing in general, would be having to manually adjust their zooms between not spectating someone and spectating someone with auto off.
11:43 < bridge> <syrinok> 
11:43 < bridge> <syrinok> It should remember your zoom levels between spectating nobody, and someone, and only swap to auto if you reset zoom while spectating someone. IMO
11:44 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but someone might still dislike that auto spec is on at all
11:45 < bridge> <syrinok> Yes, but that's just how things go, you can't please everyone, and I personally think a majority of the playerbase would enjoy the feature
11:45 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i personally new player doesn't care if there are two zoom levels default to default zoom
11:45 < bridge> <syrinok> You could please everyone by having an option for it, but that's a @heinrich5991 type thing
11:45 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i personally think new player doesn't care if there are two zoom levels default to default zoom
11:46 < bridge> <syrinok> also deen, I suppose, convince them to add an option for it :X
11:46 < bridge> <eidderFsT> is it really, henrich specifically banned tiny config
11:46 < bridge> <syrinok> also deen, I suppose, convince them to allow you to add an option for it :X
11:50 < bridge> <syrinok> I think the people that wouldn't like it are in the minority, and they'd get over it / used to it with it working how I suggested above.
11:51 < bridge> <syrinok> I also think most of the people that would hate it are already not updating their clients for various other reasons
12:01 < bridge> <eidderFsT> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1323607067038191717/video_20241231_190130.mp4?ex=677520a4&is=6773cf24&hm=6bf0b938c0180851db621d5dbb8a3261c5f0423909737bb093aecefbc7523dd7&
12:01 < bridge> <eidderFsT> my screen keep doing this lmao
12:07 < bridge> <eidderFsT> btw do you mean we turn on auto if player reset zoom at all or only in spec
12:08 < bridge> <syrinok> @tsfreddie 
12:08 < bridge> <syrinok> This is how I'd imagine it should work: 
12:08 < bridge> <syrinok> 
12:08 < bridge> <syrinok> I'm zooming out, then decide to spectate a person, it keeps my current zoom, doesn't apply auto. I reset my zoom, it swaps to whatever they're using if it can detect their zoom level, if it's null, it resets to your client's default zoom level.
12:08 < bridge> <syrinok> 
12:08 < bridge> <syrinok> I'm assuming it can detect whether it's not possible to display zoom via that cl_camerainfo thing?
12:08 < bridge> <syrinok> 
12:08 < bridge> <syrinok> It would basically work as it did prior to the update, with the added ability to see what the person is viewing, which I think has a lot of potential to be important information, getting rid of it or making it not happen on its own via default zoom seems counter-productive for the game, I think most people will benefit from having it.
12:08 < bridge> <syrinok> 
12:08 < bridge> <syrinok> But also as someone simply watching people play, I think it's a much more interesting experience seeing exactly what they're planning to do based on their zoom
12:08 < bridge> <eidderFsT> so that's why you've been typing for like 10 mins
12:08 < bridge> <syrinok> Lol ya
12:09 < bridge> <eidderFsT> turing auto spec off is easy, but when do we turn it back on.
12:10 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i think you should only be able to turn it back on if you are spectating
12:10 < bridge> <syrinok> When you press your zoom reset button
12:10 < bridge> <syrinok> So when it detects your zoom value went to your client's default
12:11 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye, that might feels really weird where you feel like auto spec cam automatically turns back on
12:12 < bridge> <eidderFsT> how about we just make auto spec cam default to off, unless you specifically right click during spec?
12:12 < bridge> <eidderFsT> although new players might never know how to turn it on.
12:13 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye it is weird lol
12:13 < bridge> <eidderFsT> let's just do it how you said it. and if anyone asked i just tag you 👀
12:13 < bridge> <syrinok> Sounds good
12:14 < bridge> <syrinok> I genuinely think this is the best way to approach it
12:14 < bridge> <syrinok> After about a week of using it
12:15 < bridge> <syrinok> Obviously having options would be cool, but alas
12:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you spec someone, spec cam setting to default, you don't like it, so you zoom out. then you resume, then you reset zoom somehow, and spec again, the spec cam is on again. <- this is what i mean btw
12:16 < bridge> <syrinok> I think the current way it works has a lot more functional issues than my suggestion, and people would get used to it far quicker and hopefully not feel the need to complain. It's really just annoying having to manage 2 different zoom levels, the auto feature itself hasn't bothered me, it's been cool
12:18 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ok how about this. you can only turn auto spec cam on and off if auto spec cam is available. and if it is the first time you are in auto, and you press either + / - or reset zoom, it just turns off and override your client zoom.
12:18 < bridge> <syrinok> I think right click to turn auto on might be a solid idea, but then ya, some players would actually never figure out this feature exists
12:19 < bridge> <eidderFsT> so basically if you zoom at all in spec you will never get auto spec again, and then you can turn it back on by specifically reset zoom while you are already at default or right click
12:19 < bridge> <eidderFsT> and anything not auto spec is just client zoom
12:20 < bridge> <eidderFsT> btw, i need to show you something, one sec
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have a deja vu
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it speaks chinese to you?
12:22 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i honestly quite like this when i was testing it
12:22 < bridge> <eidderFsT> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1323612269728239737/2024-12-31_19-21-10.mp4?ex=6775257c&is=6773d3fc&hm=b3ee3b30db710550c08036448e4c1d1e48e05300383b00e105104c0f1e9acf21&
12:23 < bridge> <eidderFsT> lol
12:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> in case you are serious, it shows the right half on the left and left half on the right
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so motd exist in ddnet
12:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @teero777 troll, you said u never seen it beofre
12:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :justatest:
12:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> what did i do
12:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> is that the zooming out then go to other spec effect?
12:29 < bridge> <syrinok> This could be a fine solution, but I think you're just catering a bit too much towards the people that dislike the feature.
12:29 < bridge> <syrinok> 
12:29 < bridge> <syrinok> I think my suggestions would be enough to make these people happy.
12:29 < bridge> <syrinok> 
12:29 < bridge> <syrinok> I think being able to see exactly what the other tee is seeing is completely natural.
12:29 < bridge> <syrinok> 
12:29 < bridge> <syrinok> The only gripe would be the client is trying to make decisions for you (automatically zooming in when you click spectate on a tee, when you're currently trying to see a zoomed out version)
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> happy last day of year
12:31 < bridge> <syrinok> Same to you
12:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> no, it's just that i introduced two zoom values people really hate right now
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont work till next year
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont code till next year
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont play ddnet till next year
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont use rust till next year
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont eat ramen till next year
12:32 < bridge> <syrinok> I'll be honest, I've gotten mostly used to it, but it does have me putting in more inputs than I usually do
12:34 < bridge> <syrinok> This could be a fine solution, but I think you're just catering a bit too much towards the people that dislike the feature.
12:34 < bridge> <syrinok> 
12:34 < bridge> <syrinok> I think my suggestions would be enough to make these people happy.

12:36 < bridge> <syrinok> Who else besides me and louis voiced problems with the feature anyways? :greenthing:

12:38 < bridge> <syrinok> :troll:
12:38 < bridge> <eidderFsT> hmm self spec actually worked like i expected it to
12:40 < bridge> <eidderFsT> can i merge self spec values to be one, but still separate other's
12:41 < bridge> <eidderFsT> trivial change and solves specifically that one louis comment. (not the i don't want to see other's shitty default 10 one, but the self spec one)
12:48 < bridge> <eidderFsT> thoughts?
12:48 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ah, bad time to tag, dad got home i need to have dinner.
12:48 < bridge> <eidderFsT> <a:InsaneCat:1135575687172980866>  later
12:57 < bridge> <syrinok> Not quite sure what you mean
12:58 < bridge> <eidderFsT> so like if you self spec it uses client zoom always. but if you spec other players it is still the current master behaviour
12:58 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i only need to change one line for this
13:15 < bridge> <syrinok> Still not following 100% I think, do you mean quite literally spectating your own tee? Going from spectating someone else to spectating your own tee having the same zoom value?
13:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> going from freeview or playing to spectateing your own tee
13:15 < bridge> <eidderFsT> which is what the original louis comment talked about i think
13:16 < bridge> <eidderFsT> to make sure going from freeview or playing to spectateing your own tee having the same zoom value
13:17 < bridge> <eidderFsT> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1323589104612413513
13:17 < bridge> <eidderFsT> to make sure going from / into freeview or playing to / from spectateing your own tee having the same zoom value
13:18 < bridge> <syrinok> The problem that I have with it would still remain, ya?
13:18 < bridge> <eidderFsT> do you have a problem with it
13:18 < bridge> <eidderFsT> :justatest:
13:18 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i thought we are just addressing louis's issue
13:18 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya, the 2 zoom thing is annoying xD
13:19 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ok then
13:19 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ~~ill remove auto spec cam~~
13:19 < bridge> <eidderFsT> not really
13:19 < bridge> <syrinok> I think most people would feel like they're fighting the 2 different zooms until they get used to it, but you still have to manage it
13:19 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i'll do a impl and tag you soon. you'll see
13:20 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i still think if you play with one zoom it doesn't really matter if you successfully managed your spec zoom or not
13:21 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you'll always go back to your original zoom when you unspec anyway
13:21 < bridge> <syrinok> The problem to the solution seems obvious, you simply have one zoom level and a direct POV when you reset zoom, the client shouldn't try to decide that you WANT to use auto when you're already zooming, you're zooming for a reason
13:21 < bridge> <eidderFsT> which is exactly what you've been using for playing
13:21 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it doesnt
13:21 < bridge> <syrinok> It does
13:21 < bridge> <syrinok> Until you manage the zoom level
13:21 < bridge> <eidderFsT> if you turn of auto spec it never changes your zoom level for spec
13:22 < bridge> <eidderFsT> sure there are two but it is what you used when spec
13:22 < bridge> <zhn> its kinda easy to get used to though
13:23 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i also thought you were trying to let me reenable auto spec zoom based on currently zoom level btw. which i really dislike
13:23 < bridge> <zhn> did in a day of playing
13:23 < bridge> <syrinok> There's a command for it, or do you mean make it greyed out by zooming out?
13:23 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye it greyed out when you zoom out and never turn it self back on.
13:23 < bridge> <syrinok> If I make it greyed out by zooming out, then adjust my zoom then go spec again, it's not trying to copy my zoom level at all, I have to change it for both
13:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> that is true
13:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but you are not playing when you are in freeview
13:24 < bridge> <syrinok> when spectating players *
13:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you still go back to your playing zoom
13:24 < bridge> <syrinok> I don't think you understand how often people zoom out and look at people
13:25 < bridge> <syrinok> and having to adjust both actively isn't good for gameplay
13:25 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but you are not playing when you  are spectating players
13:25 < bridge> <eidderFsT> sure
13:25 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i'm down to remove the two levels
13:25 < bridge> <syrinok> If I'm zooming out and looking between players, I 100% want it to be consistent between freeview and locked on to a player
13:26 < bridge> <syrinok> I'll reset my zoom happily when I want to see their exact POV
13:26 < bridge> <syrinok> I basically already do that
13:26 < bridge> <syrinok> It would feel the most intuitive this way
13:26 < bridge> <syrinok> And I think for most people
13:26 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i can do that
13:26 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but i still dont want to reenable auto spec cam unless you are spectating player btw
13:28 < bridge> <syrinok> It already works this way, no?
13:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> no
13:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> auto spec cam never reenable itself
13:28 < bridge> <syrinok> I mean when resetting zoom
13:28 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ye but only when you are spectating players
13:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> not when you resst zoom when playing
13:29 < bridge> <syrinok> But you're saying it'd work exactly how it does, if I was to spectate a player and reset zoom, it'd go to auto
13:29 < bridge> <syrinok> I never suggested changing that behavior
13:29 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i think you sugguested reset zoom then spec player it would reenable auto
13:30 < bridge> <syrinok> Hm, I guess intuitively it should work that way, since you're at default zoom?
13:30 < bridge> <syrinok> Can it not detect that you're at default zoom and just use auto?
13:30 < bridge> <syrinok> At all times if you're at default zoom, I think it should just use auto
13:31 < bridge> <syrinok> Would be the cleanest approach
13:31 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it can but i dont want to
13:31 < bridge> <syrinok> Why?
13:32 < bridge> <eidderFsT> if you spec someone turn off auto but zoom out, resume and reset zoom, next time you spec someone it feels like auto turned itself back on
13:32 < bridge> <eidderFsT> if you spec someone turn off auto by zooming out, resume and reset zoom, next time you spec someone it feels like auto turned itself back on
13:32 < bridge> <kebscs> +1
13:33 < bridge> <kebscs> I play on non default zoom and it just keeps jumping
13:33 < bridge> <eidderFsT> thats unrelated to auto spec cam, we already decided to remove the twolevels
13:33 < bridge> <syrinok> Wouldn't a sane person that understands how to zoom figure out that resetting their zoom level is tied to this feature, especially with the bottom right icon turning red? I think you're worrying too much here. It's something someone should be able to figure out and then understand from there on out
13:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> thats unrelated to reenabling auto spec cam, we already decided to remove the two levels
13:34 < bridge> <kebscs> What's the auto spec cam
13:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> the icon doesnt show when you are playing
13:34 < bridge> <kebscs> Thought the auto in a corner means auto zoom
13:34 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it shows you what camera setting players are using
13:34 < bridge> <syrinok> But surely they'll zoom out once and then see it change when spectating someone, then learn?
13:35 < bridge> <eidderFsT> that might be 30 minutes apart and have no connective context
13:35 < bridge> <syrinok> I can very easily see it out of the corner of my eye, and I'm legally blind
13:35 < bridge> <kebscs> So a zoom?
13:36 < bridge> <eidderFsT> im down to remove the two spec levels but you should only be able to turn auto back on when the icon is shown
13:36 < bridge> <eidderFsT> the icon does not show when you are playing
13:36 < bridge> <syrinok> I think a person not able to figure this out would have bigger problems.
13:36 < bridge> <syrinok> 
13:36 < bridge> <syrinok> Sacrificing quality of use for this very unlikely case seems odd
13:37 < bridge> <eidderFsT> so you resetting zoom while playing does not tell you auto is on
13:38 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i dont want people hitting reset zoom while playing and wonder why auto turned itself on when they spec someone  30 minutes later
13:39 < bridge> <syrinok> I think you're too worried, but whatever
13:40 < bridge> <eidderFsT> @gerdoe do you like the two separate level lol
13:40 < bridge> <syrinok> I don't see how anyone could like the 2 spec level :justatest:  it's just added inputs to deal with
13:41 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i liked it specifically for that video, but i can see how most people won't like it
13:41 < bridge> <syrinok> I think you just really like the idea of right click toggling the feature on
13:41 < bridge> <eidderFsT> that is already the cas
13:42 < bridge> <eidderFsT> that is already the case
13:42 < bridge> <syrinok> Is it? You mean spectating a player?
13:42 < bridge> <eidderFsT> when you spectating a player right click turn auto spec cam on
13:42 < bridge> <syrinok> Oh, ya, never knew. so you were right new players would never figute that out haha
13:42 < bridge> <eidderFsT> btw idk why auto spec icon shows for current players
13:43 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it really shouldn't
13:43 < bridge> <syrinok> Freddie pls

13:44 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i'm dumb
13:44 < bridge> <syrinok> Idk what any of that means :greenthing:
13:44 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i forgot to respect server info about whether a client is sending camera info at all
13:45 < bridge> <zhn> ye its really neat
13:46 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i think i'll fix the actual bug, and louis's self spec issue
13:46 < bridge> <zhn> i also love to jump from freeview to players pov
13:46 < bridge> <eidderFsT> maybe that's what is been bothering Skeith
13:46 < bridge> <syrinok> god fucking dammit
13:46 < bridge> <syrinok> Nope, not at all, fuck 2 zooms
13:46 < bridge> <eidderFsT> cuz if player doesn't send camera info it really should default to your default zoom
13:47 < bridge> <zhn> what would you make instead lol
13:47 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i mean currently, not ideally
13:47 < bridge> <syrinok> zhn is a vanilla player isn't he? He hates everything we stand for, don't listen to him!
13:47 < bridge> <syrinok> HELP
13:47 < bridge> <zhn> you can't keep only players' zoom or user's zoom
13:48 < bridge> <syrinok> I want it to work like it did previously, but only activate auto to adjust the zoom when spectating another player when I press reset / have default zoom when I swap to them
13:48 < bridge> <zhn> you can just ask freddie to add new command but big H would refuse instantly
13:48 < bridge> <eidderFsT> just try the next artifact and let me know if you still hate it with passion.
13:49 < bridge> <syrinok> Which I believe is the best approach, rather than having to manually change the zoom level again, when I was ALREADY zoomed out, I don't want the client to force me to zoom in when I'm trying to zoom out
13:49 < bridge> <learath2> What are we discussing here? I'm good at finding compromises to controversial stuff
13:49 < bridge> <syrinok> Seems so obvious to me
13:49 < bridge> <zhn> 2 level zoom
13:49 < bridge> <syrinok> @learath2 u use the new nightly yet?
13:49 < bridge> <learath2> Why 2 level when 1 level would do?
13:49 < bridge> <syrinok> It already works this way, ya
13:49 < bridge> <syrinok> well, did
13:49 < bridge> <learath2> Not yet. I'm away for christmas
13:50 < bridge> <zhn> to let you see another player's pov
13:50 < bridge> <learath2> Whats the second level for?
13:50 < bridge> <zhn> like zoom, dyncam, cursor
13:50 < bridge> <learath2> Ah when you spec someone you get their zoom?
13:50 < bridge> <zhn> yep, everything
13:50 < bridge> <learath2> @syrinok why bad?
13:51 < bridge> <zhn> :kek:
13:51 < bridge> <learath2> @gerdoe @tsfreddie why good?
13:51 < bridge> <syrinok> Basically, when I zoom out and then select a player it'll turn on auto camera, which copies their exact zoom level. which is cool and all. But I'm saying it SHOULDN'T happen when I'm already zooming out and trying to see shit, so basically it overrides what I'm trying to do and zooms my camera tf in, then I have to zoom back out, but if I stop spectating that tee, it has a completely different zoom level, and I have to manually change that
13:51 < bridge> <zhn> i always wondered how people play and now i can just by spectating them
13:52 < bridge> <zhn> makes stuff complicated a bit when spectating vanilla but its even better to have different zoom levels there
13:52 < bridge> <syrinok> IM GETTING PISSED!!! THAT'S IT!!! FIST FIGHT ME FREDDIE
13:52 < bridge> <zhn> like you can jump in freeview with bigger zoom and then hoo on player with default 10
13:52 < bridge> <syrinok> LETS GO DUDE
13:52 < bridge> <zhn> to see their play
13:52 < bridge> <syrinok> (He'd kick my ass)
13:52 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i don't care about two zooms. it was there because it makes sense to implement to toggle a new spectating feature. where you can see other players camera setting.
13:52 < bridge> <meloƞ> Why are mods screaming again
13:52 < bridge> <zhn> aren't you both same height
13:52 < bridge> <syrinok> I think he's taller than me lol
13:53 < bridge> <syrinok> Ah, I have weight on him, I'd crush him actually
13:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> Freddie is Asian, you have no chance!a
13:53 < bridge> <eidderFsT> it shouldn't for current players because they aren't actually sending camera info. it was a bug
13:53 < bridge> <zhn> freddie is hot, you have no chance :troll:
13:53 < bridge> <eidderFsT> not erally
13:53 < bridge> <syrinok> gg
13:53 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i have heart problems and can't move very much
13:54 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you'll stop my heart attack before i can do anything.
13:54 < bridge> <eidderFsT> you'll stop my heart before i can do anything.
13:54 < bridge> <syrinok> Alright, if your fix doesn't fix my problems with it, we fight irl
13:54 < bridge> <zhn> you can heart attack him
13:54 < bridge> <syrinok> It's going down, like it or not
13:54 < bridge> <syrinok> I'LL FIND YOU (this is not a real threat, I'm a pussy)
13:54 < bridge> <eidderFsT> if you spec people regularly with your default zoom settings (not some random zoom you decided on the spot) i think it solves it for you
13:55 < bridge> <syrinok> I don't
13:55 < bridge> <syrinok> I love zooming tf out
13:55 < bridge> <eidderFsT> then you can fight me and kill me
13:55 < bridge> <eidderFsT> then i can stop worry about this
13:55 < bridge> <syrinok> gg
13:55 < bridge> <eidderFsT> otherwise it is a one time adjustment really.
13:55 < bridge> <syrinok> Please take my suggestion, so we can mostly all be happy (I think, well, at least I will be and that's cool)
13:56 < bridge> <eidderFsT> maybe later
13:56 < bridge> <eidderFsT> louis said a problem and i should fix his first which is what i did

13:58 < bridge> <eidderFsT> this line shouldn't hunt me really
13:58 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but it did
13:58 < bridge> <eidderFsT> do we host server using master
13:58 < bridge> <zhn> xd
13:59 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but i guess that did saved me causing more panic after release tho
13:59 < bridge> <syrinok> Learath best boy
13:59 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i think i didn't find this line cuz the old server don't have this problem so i assumed it was fine
13:59 < bridge> <eidderFsT> oof
14:01 < bridge> <eidderFsT> btw i think new player would find two levels of zoom handy imho which is why i decided to go that route. but it is indeed very bugged based on that one line tho
14:01 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but i also wouldn't mind removing that
14:01 < bridge> <eidderFsT> again
14:01 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i want to reassure you
14:02 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i will remove it once i get actual feedback on the fixed version
14:02 < bridge> <syrinok> I think otherwise, I think it's extremely tedious, and feels wrong
14:02 < bridge> <eidderFsT> <a:amogus:876956004674338848>
14:02 < bridge> <eidderFsT> that's what you think
14:02 < bridge> <eidderFsT> and i respect that
14:02 < bridge> <eidderFsT> and willing to change what i think
14:03 < bridge> <eidderFsT> after more feedback
14:03 < bridge> <syrinok> @learath2 HELP
14:03 < bridge> <syrinok> Install the nightly version and yell at this man, he loves you
14:03 < bridge> <eidderFsT> does lerato play ddnet
14:03 < bridge> <syrinok> Sometimes!
14:04 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i actually don't know if anyone plays here, cuz i can't really see. even if i am still playing myself i couldn't tell in chn servers probably
14:04 < bridge> <syrinok> I have the 2nd most time spent on this game overall in finishes!
14:05 < bridge> <eidderFsT> is that why you dispite louis cuz you are both USA and you want to be the one USA player?
14:05 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ~~is that why you dispite louis cuz you are both USA and you want to be the one USA player?~~
14:05 < bridge> <syrinok> Yes
14:05 < bridge> <eidderFsT> that's very USA of you
14:06 < bridge> <syrinok> Fun trivia: Before louis was known, he used to join me and actively try to troll me
14:06 < bridge> <syrinok> before he was even named louis
14:07 < bridge> <syrinok> That was before I was a moderator as well though!
14:07 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i am actually very tired btw
14:07 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i'll definitly check how to fix your problem
14:07 < bridge> <eidderFsT> but really
14:07 < bridge> <eidderFsT> not right now
14:07 < bridge> <syrinok> Go to sleep~
14:07 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i rushed our website and i'm exhausted from all the regulation stuff

14:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://bsky.app/profile/bennyjamins.bsky.social/post/3lejyz5reiz23
14:21 < bridge> <eidderFsT> what makes erlang hot patchable
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> the vm
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> called BEAM
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> erlang (beam) is rly good for distributed systems
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> its also good at spawning jobs using other languages
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has rly good interop with rust, nodejs and probs C
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rusterlium/rustler
14:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> since ite a Vm u can use other langs
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> like elixir or glesn
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> gleam
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> that compile to Beam byte code
14:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> does that mean gleam can also do tha
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> yep
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> whatsapp uses erlang
14:24 < bridge> <eidderFsT> gotta learn gleam then
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> gleam is more rust like and modern
14:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> im learning it too
14:25 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i already wrote my first rust code
14:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> ChillerDragon: i have published the code now, the main connection logic is in crates/server/src/plugins/connection.rs
14:25 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i think i'm ready (not really)
14:26 < bridge> <eidderFsT> also i didn't really write rust code. i didn't really know what i've been writing. i just write normally until it screams at me then i fix it somehow.
14:35 < bridge> <teero777> no? i said it also exists in ddnet
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @teero777 pls give assets dir
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> why
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i need some nice assets
14:36 < bridge> <eidderFsT> he need to test something but we don't use assets so juppy never go their test data
14:36 < bridge> <eidderFsT> <a:amogus:876956004674338848>

17:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> pog
17:11 < bridge> <louis> its under the ddnet github name now?
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes it's now officially public
17:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which also means it now accepts prs etc.
17:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> add ci for artifacts
17:12 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> @jupeyy_keks can i send my two skin things here now?
17:13 < bridge> <louis> ok, let me know when it has moving blocks and new weapons and ill map in its editor 😁
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Go ahead and create a pr 😄
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i sadly ran out of time
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have to go in few minutes
17:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and i had to release it before new year
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i could
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> are all deps listed? xc
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u don't really need any deps xd
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just a c compiler and rust compiler
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and u need to use rustup
17:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> epyc rust moment
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if ffmpeg works with MSVC, bcs with mingw cross compile it does not 😄
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, defs epyc, i wish c would be gone too
17:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> msvc is worse compiler
17:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> nowadays u can use llvm in windows
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs
17:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh
17:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> also msvc is not c++ standard compliant

17:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks do u have wasm support
17:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> for ddnet itself
17:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet in browser wen
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lel, yeah we need WGPU backend for that
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rn it's vk  only
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> vk master race
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> epyc
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> im the first forker

17:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> why comment
17:19 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> what is rs
17:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lto too slow
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> panics can happen in async code
17:19 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> ddnet 🇷🇸
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> didnt want to go all out yet
17:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for 10fps
17:19 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> finally a good ddnet version
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> b4 creating new issues, there is a high chance yours is already here:

17:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i followed the readme
17:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``cargo run --release --features bundled_data_dir,ffmpeg,microphone,enable_steam``
17:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it enabled microphone
17:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> true
17:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think there are 2 versions of ndarray in use
17:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``cargo build`` and ``cargo run`` work but the readme doesn even when microphone is kicked
18:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woah even after one year tw break its super uncanny how different but same ddnet-rs feels
18:01 < bridge> <eidderFsT> do we have a way to check the frequently used skin by a name
18:01 < bridge> <eidderFsT> like just for fun
18:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watching demos in game woah!
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Oh yeah didn't test that in a longer while
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just remove mic for now
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Somewhere in this channel Souly posted stats
18:04 < bridge> <eidderFsT> like for each player, not general stats?
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Even that was possible with furos ddstats.tw
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno if someone created an alternative already
18:05 < bridge> <eidderFsT> ah
18:05 < bridge> <eidderFsT> im assuming it was collecting skin data from master list?
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
18:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is there no greensward skin?
18:06 < bridge> <eidderFsT> i could do that but i probably wont have enough data for the thing i want to do for now
18:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah there is
18:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the sort is just case sensitive hmm
18:08 < bridge> <eidderFsT> oh ryo's also have that i think

18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Thanks, but ddrs needs an index with the file hash to download anything. There is a assets server bin that can generate this index automatically.
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
18:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Thanks to the index the settings shows all assets in ui
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> what bin?
18:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I think it's called assets-server

19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Make bug report 😉
19:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or fix 😛
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> well maybe next year @jupeyy_keks 😜
19:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks is the format even compatible
19:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> the assets i sent are for ddnet 0.6
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> u split the assets right

19:45 < bridge> <murpi> What do people typically do when handling I/O tasks in Python while executing executables from cli? My issue is that windows requires executables to have a .exe extension when run from cli, whereas *nix systems don't. 
19:45 < bridge> <murpi> 
19:45 < bridge> <murpi> I currently use os.name to check which system is in use and simply append .exe if it's 'nt' (Windows) to whatever I/O task is needed, but I feel like that's not really the norm. xd
19:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> you mean calling an executable from python?
19:48 < bridge> <murpi> Yes
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess u need to detect the os yeah
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> and append the .exe
19:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> or check https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
19:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.uname
19:51 < bridge> <murpi> That's pretty much what I'm doing now, but it's ugly as hell:
19:51 < bridge> <murpi> ```py
19:51 < bridge> <murpi> def check_os() -> Tuple[str, str]:
19:51 < bridge> <murpi>     if os.name == "posix":  # Unix-like system
19:51 < bridge> <murpi>         shell = "/bin/bash"

19:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> u using this?
19:52 < bridge> <murpi> Yes
19:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> you sure windows needs .exe?
19:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> when spawning/executing
19:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know in console u dont need to type .exe
19:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway u need to know the OS because winshit accepts arguments in a different way, specially powershell
19:54 < bridge> <Ewan> pythonn
19:54 < bridge> <murpi> Not necessarily .exe but it definitely needs some kind of extension
20:18 < bridge> <broso56> I was wondering why I was pinged in dev lol, neat
20:23 < bridge> <teero777> what if i don't use bash :justatest:
20:29 < bridge> <murpi> Your computer combusts and you'll be ejected from your seat
20:30 < bridge> <teero777> noooo
20:49 < bridge> <teero777> i guess you will never see an improved run_guy_25 run. sadge
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i would use bash for all of this str8 up
20:49 < bridge> <Ewan> but thats bcs i assume msys2
20:58 < bridge> <pioooooo> @jupeyy_keks if you decide to split eyes into left & right why not just put both together?
20:58 < bridge> <pioooooo> oh is that for some more nouis..
20:58 < bridge> <pioooooo> :nouis:
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The idea is simply to not put anything together. And since ddrs supports server provided assets I thought about splitting as much as logically possible
21:05 < bridge> <woidless> 0xc00000005 error when starting DDNet Server
21:06 < bridge> <woidless> What to do?
21:08 < bridge> <pioooooo> that's great im already to see my :nouis:
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Use 64bit ddnet
21:46 < bridge> <aegisub> I don't need any extension onMyMachine™️
21:46 < bridge> <aegisub> it might depend on your PATHEXT environment variable
21:47 < bridge> <aegisub> you can also try `shutil.which("<yourcmd>")`
23:29 < terrablanca> Hello
23:31 < terrablanca> Hello, i like the idea of seeing the zoom of others but would it be possible to: When the autocam is ON (default), always see other's zoom. When the autocam is OFF (using the right click or any zoom action), always change our personal zoom level rather than a separate zoom. So that there is no difference in Zoom between playing, free view, or locked view, but the difference is whether you have autocam mode ON or OFF.
23:32 < terrablanca> So if we spec a player with autocam ON and we unspec/freeview, we'll come back to our original zoom, but not if we had autocam OFF.
23:32 < terrablanca> Also, to turn the autocam ON again, don't use the zoom reset key but rather the right-click (or unspec/respec), because you may want to use the key to return to normal zoom without necessarily seeing the other player's view.
