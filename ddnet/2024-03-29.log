00:05 < bridge> <teero777> how do i win? xD
00:05 < bridge> <teero777> are there only 2 endings?
00:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
00:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> @teero777 its more a philosophical thing
00:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> about the prompts and AIs
00:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> a story
00:07 < bridge> <teero777> :(
00:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not real AI
00:07 < bridge> <teero777> ;(
00:07 < bridge> <teero777> i wishd there was a better ending :(
00:13 < bridge> <Ewan> i could tell when you didnâ€™t catch my lack of parentheses

06:09 < bridge> <Ewan> what tf is this
06:09 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome

07:36 < bridge> <learath2> @robyt3 do you happen to know where we keep symbols for the released versions of the game?
08:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Jopsti you have to check it out. That granny calls some apt package bloated :D
08:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Was also in my recommendations ewan xd
08:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> As far as I understood it Heinrich and deen are cool with it
08:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @learath2: how do I get your blessing?
09:56 < bridge> <matodor> pls allow 0.7 to die ðŸ¥º
10:15 < bridge> <robyt3> https://ddnet.org/downloads/symbols/ only contains 17.1 and newer though
10:17 < bridge> <learath2> Do we have some tool to decode backtraces? I wanted to look at https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/757720336274948198/1221467989187104909
10:19 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't look like a Dr.Mingw crash dump from a Windows system, in which case you could have used `scripts/parse_drmingw.sh`. Guess you'll have to it manually (addr2line)
10:20 < bridge> <robyt3> I'm not sure if you can even do anything with a unix core dump since we only have the Windows symbols
10:21 < bridge> <learath2> Oh we donâ€™t keep linux symbols? Thatâ€™s a shame
10:23 < bridge> <robyt3> No, looks like the website on has Windows symbols, I don't think we've needed linux symbols before
10:23 < bridge> <robyt3> No, looks like the website only has Windows symbols, I don't think we've needed linux symbols before
10:58 < bridge> <sedonya> How do I convert timestamp to date? D:
11:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Which type of date? `str_timestamp_ex` if you mean as a string
11:01 < bridge> <sedonya> i mean
11:01 < bridge> <sedonya> ```
11:01 < bridge> <sedonya> "first_finish": {
11:01 < bridge> <sedonya>     "timestamp": 1374159904,
11:01 < bridge> <sedonya>     "map": "Challenge",
11:01 < bridge> <sedonya>     "time": 1412.18
11:01 < bridge> <sedonya> ```
11:03 < bridge> <robyt3> Timestamps have type `time_t` in our code I think
11:03 < bridge> <sedonya> thanks a lot
12:52 < bridge> <learath2> Eh, unlikely. I don't see much value in it, but a lot of undue maintainance burden. As long as it's rather disconnected I won't make much noise about it
14:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://github.com/diia-open-source does every country have smth like dat? :thonk:
15:00 < bridge> <reitw> we have `France IdentitÃ© ` in france, but closed source tho
15:24 < bridge> <astramast> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1223276546949648565/image.png?ex=66194410&is=6606cf10&hm=25100c30a5b9f1d4e1d859d7a183cc21e18faad90b0375fe625c0a813e5cb80d&
15:24 < bridge> <astramast> This was an excellent idea but why are we limited to 3 tabs ?
15:27 < bridge> <furo321> It's the maximum amount of tabs that will fit on the smallest supported resolution.
15:27 < bridge> <Peakies> maybe cuz of smaller monitors
15:28 < bridge> <Peakies> on next updates I think it's possible to add arrow button to load more tabs
15:33 < bridge> <robyt3> We'd solve a lot of issues and testing if we forced UI to be 16:9 with letter box, I'm just not sure how usable it would really be on small monitors if the UI is reduced to a letterbox instead of using the full height (see #7940)

15:59 < bridge> <pilonpl> https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json
16:00 < bridge> <pilonpl> why dont all clients have the afk field
16:00 < bridge> <pilonpl> ?
16:01 < bridge> <robyt3> Probably old servers that don't send the afk field yet

17:15 < bridge> <learath2> Indeed
18:02 < bridge> <louis> same
18:03 < bridge> <louis> i didnt like the death ending anyways kinda doctored
18:03 < bridge> <teero777> what was the theoretical max map size again?
18:03 < bridge> <teero777> smth around 23000x23000. but i dont know the exact value and i cant find the convo where we discussed that anymore

19:49 < bridge> <marwin._> This video has been in my feed for the past week. I can not get it out
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> itâ€™s awesome
19:49 < bridge> <marwin._> ðŸ˜­ I should prolly watch it
19:50 < bridge> <marwin._> Ran into so many problems when I installed it on this machine
19:57 < bridge> <peter0x44> she has the same specs as me
20:14 < bridge> <learath2> go-lang `defer` statements are verycool
20:15 < bridge> <reitw> u went to the dark side
20:38 < bridge> <reitw> @ryozuki https://lwn.net/Articles/967180/
20:38 < bridge> <reitw> :KEKSad:
20:59 < bridge> <chairn> damn, that's quite interesting way to inject backdoors
20:59 < bridge> <chairn> and the guy caught the backdoor just because ssh took 0.8s rather than 0.3s ðŸ˜„
22:07 < bridge> <chairn> well, at least it justifies the hate for systemd of @learath2
23:22 < bridge> <0xdeen> It also justifies the hate of distributions changing upstream packages significantly, thus increasing the attack surface and risk
23:26 < bridge> <0xdeen> Also, good idea to run test suites with sanitizers and valgrind and keep them green, that prevented Fedora from already having switched to this xz version
23:29 < bridge> <0xdeen> Also, don't add new maintainers to a software project that easily
23:42 < bridge> <reitw> the thing is, somewhat someone decided to use github for the repo
23:42 < bridge> <reitw> the real main git repo apparently is not impacted
23:43 < bridge> <cyberFighter> tf is xz
23:45 < bridge> <0xdeen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils
23:47 < bridge> <cyberFighter> oh ok
23:47 < bridge> <cyberFighter> seems so random, why a backdoor on a compressor
23:48 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i guess its like the first thing they got permissions on
23:48 < bridge> <0xdeen> The compressor is linked into ssh, which is the secure way everyone accesses their servers (on popular distributions)
23:48 < bridge> <0xdeen> The way to go if you want to get a vulnerability into ssh: Check what libraries it links with `ldd`, then check which of those libraries is the worst maintained, become a maintainer of that library and add the vulnerability
23:50 < bridge> <cyberFighter> had to google like 3 different things to figure out but i understand
23:50 < bridge> <cyberFighter> xd
23:58 < bridge> <chairn> how did you know you could trust all ddnet maintainers ?
