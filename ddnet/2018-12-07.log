00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I added a new cpp file under game/client/components and a responding header file and i included the header in gameclient
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but it seems like the cpp file isnt compiled because i have a lot of code in tehre that shouldnt compile but it still successfully compiles with 0 warnings
00:47 <+Learath2> Did you add it to CMakeLists ?
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> iu guess i should
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lemme have a look at the file
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah i see evertyhign is added manually thgere
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ok nice ty @Learath2 i have my expected errors now c:
00:58 <+Learath2> it used to be a glob, but apparently this is a better practice
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I must say, banks have one of the most broken corporate structures that I've ever seen
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Why?
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can complain all you want, the branch manager can be apologetic all he wants, but if he can't communicate with the internal department responsible for your problem your problem won't get fixed
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No way you can directly talk to the internal department either
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So complaining is pointless, you just submit a request and wait until the responsible person decides to read complaints
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> be prepared to wait at least 6 months to get what you need 😃
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> luckily I know a guy who knows a guy
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's either that or you need to have a ridiculous amount of money in your account (which sadly I don't) 😛
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> that helps 😋
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh well, luckily I never had problems with my bank and they even correctly detected and reimbursed me when someone stole my credit card info (might be DDNet server related, tried way too many hosters)
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not sure if that's just your bank or all though
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo guiis
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can some1 explain snapshots?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I wonder how ofthen the CGameClient::OnNewSnapshop() function gets called
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> hey, no idea i'm not familiar with that, you could either ++ a static var or use  tools like hmm i don't remember is it gprof ? gcov/lcov lvoc something like that
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You get one snapshot per ticks that could be processed before the next ticks start time
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is unless you are connecting or recovering and your snap rate is limited
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol all this code gets executed every tick?
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It iterates over all skin names and compares them for evey player?
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No, it gets executed every couple ticks
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it could potentially be executed every tick yes
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how is the client still that fast haha
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In the runloop the server gets the current time, then until it's time for the next tick to start it'll keep ticking. As soon as it's time for the next tick to start, it'll snap. And unless you are a rate-limited client you'll get a snap
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> So the client should get slower the more skins you have i guess
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because languages like C/C++/Rust are no joke, they have a ridiculous amount of optimisation that goes into them and they are blazingly fast
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I thought the skin graphics are saved on join and on change
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A computer can do a lot more then one might imagine after using a language like Java or something interpreted like python
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Because i want to add something similar to a skin system to my client without slowing it down :c
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its like a second skin
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> So i am save with iterating over a big array of strings every tick and compare it agianst all the playernames
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where in OnNewSnapshot do we iterate every skin?
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> m_aClients[ClientID].m_SkinID = g_GameClient.m_pSkins->Find(m_aClients[ClientID].m_aSkinName);
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think here
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if i understood it correctly
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> find does stuff and then calls FindImpl
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> int CSkins::FindImpl(const char *pName) const
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> {
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>     for(int i = 0; i < m_aSkins.size(); i++)
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>     {
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>         if(str_comp(m_aSkins[i].m_aName, pName) == 0)
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>         {
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>             return i;
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>         }
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>     }
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>     return -1;
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> }
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah i see
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's for each snapped player mind you
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so only players close to you
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh so snapped players are only close players?
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea so all visible players i guess
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i play a lot whit showall on full ddnet servers
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also only for players that changed Clientinfo
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wait only if they changed it
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where do i see that
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if(Item.m_Type == NETOBJTYPE_CLIENTINFO)
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah here?
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Snapshots are deltas
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they indicate change
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what ever that means xd
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which word do you not understand in that sentence?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> delete but i get it now
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> delete is change i rememberd something from school
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> delta*
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not delete xd
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> The server sends delta snapshots but the client reconstructs the full snap before processing it. But well... calling this code 25 times per second isn't that much
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> k thanks @redix
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What the actual fuck is wrong with windows? .....
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Learath2 what do you mean
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> everything is fcked
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> october up,
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> edge -> chromium,
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> ....
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm trying to get the stupid utf8 output working on console
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not possible I think
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe we can just create our own console-like window in sdl2?
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> good luck, from what i saw it might be done but with big caveats like not on all win versions and so on
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or just turn off the console alltogether on windows and write to a log file
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there are editors on windows that can display utf8 just fine
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought outputting with WriteConsoleW would handle all the stupid parts but apparently even that isn't enough
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao how does one find someone on ddnet.tw when they have a utf8 name?
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> uh you could copy paste from in-game or somewhere
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or navigate through favorite partners
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and if it's not all uft8 chars you might get away by searching the non utf8 ones and then have the right suggestion
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is just insane, how this can even happe nis beyond me
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the data is completely garbled by the time it makes it into kernel32.dll
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's like they rand() it
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> does mintty uses cmd ?
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> https://i.imgur.com/GUiy7e4.png
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mbrtowcs also totally destroys the pointer it gets, wtf
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> " however, mintty is not a full replacement for the Windows Console window (by default running the Windows Command Processor / command prompt / cmd.exe)."
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mintty is sane
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mbsrtowcs I mean
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the data is garbled way before we hand it off to msvcrt though 🤔
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```5B 32 30 31 38 2D 31 32 2D 30 37 20 32 31 3A 32 34 3A 31 38 5D 5B 63 68 61 74 5D 3A 20 4C 65 61 72 61 74 68 32 3A 20 7A D1 94 E2 84 93```
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is what gets to the logger, those aren't valid code points
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```5B 32 30 31 38 2D 31 32 2D 30 37 20 32 31 3A 32 34 3A 31 38 5D 5B 63 68 61 74 5D 3A 20 4C 65 61 72 61 74 68 32 3A 20 7A D1 94 E2 84 93```
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually no they are just fine...

22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How does one encode utf16?
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It only took me 4 hours \o/
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And after all that I got told by Mithrandir that I should be focusing on other issues 🙂
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As always very rewarding to work on this stuff 😛
