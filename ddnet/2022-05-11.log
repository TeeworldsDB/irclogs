02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> I like the new HUD. I sometimes did parts harder, because I forgot I have endless jump.
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> Is there also an indicator for strong / week hook? That's depending on every tee right?

02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> Is there also an indicator for strong / week hook? That's depending on every tee right?, so migh not be suitable for hud
04:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> might be cool to have an indicator pop up while you're hooking someone
04:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so that it only shows then and not all the time
06:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> There is, Forgot the command but search in f1 for something with nameplates strong

08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :TOOBASED:
08:57 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar pls fix #5086 mac build
08:57 <+ChillerDragon> omg ddnet bot where
08:57 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5086
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> What happend to server chat messages? I saw some weird commit about it
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> I assume "chatresp" is a magic string
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/d5f8bc27836cf77e7490fcc57e8cb0ddf2126b7f
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> ah yea
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> hrmpf
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you mean a new strong week indicator, in addition to the old one that already exists above the tees head?
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustAskingDude> lovely devs, can you please tell me what happened to the ddnet client over the last like 2 months, I have gone from being able to connect to any ddnet server and connect my dummy on any of them no problem, to having to connect to most of the ddnet servers like 5-10 times before the server actually decides to let me in, and even when I log in, I cannot connect my dummy - it seems completely random, and there are no logs I can see to
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustAskingDude> are these code related, or some measures against ddosing ?
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can test old clients, just download them form https://ddnet.tw/downloads/
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> for example DDNet 15.6.2 ... 
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> This probably is more likely related to ddos, I also notice that I can not connect to servers in the last few days/weeks. Probably your connection request gets dropped while ddos, and maybe the client does not try to resend the request.
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustAskingDude> What is interesting, is that when I finally connect, there are no issues with ping on the server, and other people are able to connect their dummies
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustAskingDude> but that always been the case with ddos I guess, for whatever reason some people can still move fairly ok, while others are lagging all around
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> can really depend of many things
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustAskingDude> any way to help you guys with those ddos attacks ?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> About <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5085> what do you think, should I rename `hud.png` to `ddnet.png` or `ddrace.png` I will change also the asset tab name accordingly. The Idea was to include also new textures we use in our game into that png, for features that are not vanilla (like the new shields), but allow vanilla to extend their `game.png` so we can still merge their PR that changes the `game.png` because of added  vanilla feat
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> pray for kinder people that do not need to ddos so we have peace in teeworlds
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ImJustAskingDude> tough
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can test old clients, just download them form https://ddnet.tw/downloads/
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> for example DDNet 15.6.2 ... 
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> This probably is more likely related to ddos, I also noticed that I can not connect to servers in the last few days/weeks. Probably your connection request gets dropped while ddos, and maybe the client does not try to resend the request.
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> You could change the timer as well and make it more speedrun friendly
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> tell me more
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> tell me more, what do you mean with "more speedrun friendly"
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Milliseconds
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> This is probably not as easy as it sounds. We could display milliseconds, but you'd be disappointed if they didn't match your actual finish time, wouldn't you?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think that there is a problem with the client time is not perfectly in sync with the server ticks... so they would not match perfectly. Also it would mean to change the font size so we have enough space if you want to display ms
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Ah I se
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Der
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Ah I see
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> add, didn't know that, ü§ê
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> ahh, didn't know that, ü§ê
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Is it possible to download the builds that the CI makes or are they deleted directly?
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ```
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Run actions/upload-artifact@v1

15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD to what server are the artifacts uploaded and is it the executable?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Ah I have found them
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <coldrun> I find this really interesting. Sometimes trivial things are the hard things. I remember also this about youtube view count, that it got stuck on viral videos for some reason, after publishing.
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> does anyone know how do the eyes move in teeworlds
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> like how it's implemented
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> cause they go in a circle
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is that the answer to your question?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> uh
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> no, not really
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think he's asking where in the code is the eye movement handled
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> maybe
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> or just an explanation in plain english
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/490704b54344089bd1fb28d859d7398b4e8a0c0f/src/game/client/render.cpp#L696-L699
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> im trying to recreate the effect with javascript and i dont know how to start
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Alexander_ ^
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> thank you very much
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> can you explain the code a bit since im not really familiar with c++
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> like how does it offset it
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well its pretty much not c++ related code xD
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> basesize = 64
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> empte == blink means the small eyes
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> eye seperation = the gap between both eyes
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> direction = cursor direction normalized from the mid of the tee
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> rest is math
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> basesize = 64
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> emote == blink means the small eyes
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> eye seperation = the gap between both eyes
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> okay so im interested in that last line
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> direction.x would be what
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> mouse position?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> x = 1 
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mouse to right
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> x = -1 mouse to left
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> yeah the coords
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> also one more question
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> y = 1 either up or down, have to test, tw sometimes flips the coordinates
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> what does vec2 mean
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2d vector
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> nice
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> basically {x, y}
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> thats all, thank you very much
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks https://twitter.com/icculus/status/1524418759120805889
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is that you?
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes, nice finally
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> @Not Keks is Direction.x and Direction.y min and max values -1 and 1?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> normalized
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so they are never both 1
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> cant find the code for that though
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but it says direction
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> directions are always normalized
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> how do they get normalized
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> else it could also be named position
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well with normalize()? xd
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u dont know what that is, its math
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> sorry if im asking dumb questions, im trying to understand it so i could rewrite it in javascript
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u divice all components by the length of the vector
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> `x *= 1/sqrt(x*x + y*y)`
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> same for y
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> shit, this is really complicated for my small brain
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its ez just think in geometric algebra
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> just think in what now
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> im not as smart as you think I am
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well can u image the length of a vector=
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its basically how long the arrow is
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i understand that
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u divide all components by that length, u basically get a value inside a 1 big circle
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no matter how your vector looks like(if its non zero)
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the length will be 1
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> of the new vector
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so you can basically draw a circle around it
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and u want a circle
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs thats how the eyes rotate
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u divide a 1 dimensional number its the same
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 1/1 = 1
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2/2 = 2
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its basically the same for 2d values
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> im just gonna give up doing it the teeworlds way and try to do it another way
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://www.fundza.com/vectors/normalize/
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 1/1 = 1
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2/2 = 1
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-natural-simulations/programming-vectors/a/vector-magnitude-normalization
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol they have js code
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do you know what a normalized vector is in the first place?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you gotta know things in order to understand them
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i dont really understand why its using vectors in the first place
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs its a 2d game
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so u need a 2d number
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in 3d u use 3d numbers
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> so basically coordinates?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> coordinates are numbers
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 1d coordinate is just plain numbers
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 2d coordinates is a 2d number
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a normalized vector is one whose length is 1
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes imagine the number is 1 away from 0
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> ohhhhh
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Math.sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = length
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> basically like a hookline in tw can represent a vector, yes?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if ur tee is 0
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and u dont move xd
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but not a normalized vector
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs the hookline is the length of the hook
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not 1
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> a normalized vector can also include values greater then abs(-1) no?
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> there https://github.com/C0D3D3V/ddnet/blob/490704b54344089bd1fb28d859d7398b4e8a0c0f/src/game/client/components/players.cpp#L383

19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why should it
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> normalized = length 1 from 0
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> only edge case is vector(0, 0)
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then u broke math
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and have a blackhole
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> (0,0) is forbidden as target direction in ddnet, in multiple locations xD  can happen probably but you should not worry to much about it
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes, happened before
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i fixed all NaNs i could find
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> problem with computers if ofc the limited range
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 0 is not the same as 0 in math
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats also why 1/0 is infinity in computer science
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you want to fix one more NaN? I have a very famous one for you
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its just a value VERY VERY close to 0
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> its all fun and games until the tee looks into your soul like this
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> https://i.imgur.com/fjCPiED.png

19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> these dark eyes eat your soul
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maths undefined behaviour
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> btw thats a render
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this reminded me of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrU9YDoXE88
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its bout this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tell me which xd
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> shotgun bug ?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD yes
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ^^
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I already debugged it with UBSan ... its easy to find
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> heinrich has to fix it, he is used to getting hate for breaking physics
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can't be fixed
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like the shotgun bug
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> could just set the int to INT_MAX when legnth of the pos is 0
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then its at least not UB XD
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XD
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> purposly set behavior
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> deen said we should keep the physics for the shotgun bug, so you just have to define the behaviour instead of undifiend NaN
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> "its a feature"
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder if there is atleast 1 run where the server was affected by a cosmic ray
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it gave an advantage
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we gotta fix the universe
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD

19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there are no spaces
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> uff

19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> it is until you point in the center
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> in tw it just sets it to angle 0
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> @Alexander_ how old are you?
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> why ask?
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> to help you understand things
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> as i think you mix programming vectors and mathematical vectors
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> im 19
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> did you have any algebra course yet?
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> no
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> wait you mean in school?
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ye
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> yeah I did
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so you know what a mathematical vector is?
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> yeah
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> its like a line that has an intensity (length) and coordinates
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup, so it is used to describe position and movement in a 2D plane
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> normalized vectors are vectors whose length is equal to 1
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> in general, you use them just to get direction angle so that when you apply an operation with another vector, the new length is equal to the other vector length
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i think i understand now
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you're 19, so maybe you'll have basic algebra course next year
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> depends on your studies and country
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> im finishing school
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> this year
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> highschool? i think i learnt vectors in highschool, but more advanced stuff in 1st year university
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> learned vectors 4 years ago
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> or 3
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Highschools tend to give a very surface form of knowledge especially lacking in intuition, atleast in my country
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they teached it well here
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah, i kinda agree
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not like they have a choice though
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Wait, you got taught math in high school? üòÑ We only learned the exact steps to input into the calculator to get the result. I learned more in my first hour of university math than the previous 3 years.
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you cant expect teenagers to have a profund understanding of these things as often, it  is unfortunately not linked to real life application
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> the real problem, at least in math in France is off-ground learning
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> people don't get what it's used for
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deltaüòå> France? nice, i love France bc my friend was born in France....
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i even did matrices in high school
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and solved equation systems
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with 3 variables
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> etc
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i did equation system too in highschool, but matrices were in first year university
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> are tee eyes going in a circle or an ellipse
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> cause i feel like its an ellipse
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> what i mean by that is that the max y offset is not the same as the max x offset
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We weren't allowed calculators, so we learned some math üòÑ
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Still just mostly filling things into equations
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> math starts where your imagination ends
20:54 <+ChillerDragon> Its impressive how many 500s github throws seems like they never will fix that
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice quote

22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Ryozuki
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> Hey guys, can i ask a programming question here? Tried programming discords, but havent been able to get any solution so far üò¶ Its a java question
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://dontasktoask.com/
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> Thanks üôÇ So basically i have a problem with the split function in a for loop. I want it to be overwritten each itteration, but its not working. The first iteration is working fine, but the second iteration the array returns null
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/974056166424445019/unknown.png
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> the code isnt finished yet, but yeah i want to solve this issue first
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can you explain what you want to solve
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> by reading the file
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> The file contains text like "MEMBER:Margaret Hamilton:margaret@nasa.gov:lkd432"... i want create members out of that text file
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> first, why are you using an array instead of a arraylist
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since you clearly grow the array
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> an ArrayList does that for you
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has a handy add() method
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> you should be using `hasNextLine` instead of `hasNext` when you fetch the line using `nextLine`
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> Yep, i actually tried that from the start, but i wasnt sure how to add stuff to it directly. I think the probelm i got was when i wanted to do something like "members.get(1).setUsername"... not sure if that was the issue but it was something along those lines.. thats why i ended up using arrays
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> was probably my fault, but i went with something i knew better xD
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its way worse
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you should:
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> change the for loop for a while with the hasnextline
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> True, my bad... I just copied what my teacher told me
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use a arraylist and add stuff to it
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and probably understand what a reference is
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> I was thinking of reference being a problem as well... So what i wanted to do instead was to create a 2d array instead. But when i went to the programming discord, people said that overwriting should work in a single array as well
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```java
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> List members = new ArrayList();
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> while(scanner.hasNextLine()) {
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>   String line = scanner.nextLine();
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>   // if + split
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>   members.add(new Member(.....));
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> }
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> // here members has all the members now
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> forget about 2d arrays
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what u want to do is extremly simple and ur overcomplicating it
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> hmm alright thanks xD Its the first time im doing i/o in java so im probably doing exactly that. Overcomplicating it. But even with a arraylist i will need an array to split
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> so i guess i will come back to the same question?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to split what?
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> The split method always returns an array yeah
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> to split the line for every  ":"
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> but that doesn't affect the list of members
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah ye i was talking about the members
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> so each line is like this "MEMBER:Margaret Hamilton:margaret@nasa.gov:lkd432"
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you should completly remove the expand() its plain wrong way to do it
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> I want to add each section between the ":" to a seperate variable in member
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> yeah, if i use an arraylist i wont be needing it üôÇ
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can create the member first and then add it to the list
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> But the split function will still be needed it think
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> i*
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```java
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Member member;
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if(x) {
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>   member = new Member(...);
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> }  else {
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>   member = new Member(...)
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> }
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> members.add(member);
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah the split
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> Yeah, but i need to load members from the file itself... So if a line is "MEMBER:Margaret Hamilton:margaret@nasa.gov:lkd432" Then Margaret Hamilton will be the username, margaret@nasa.gov will be the members email, and lkf432 will need to be the userID
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> So im  pretty sure i need to run a loop even with an arraylist and use a split function with a array
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> and that is basically the problem i have right now
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> Sorry if im missing something obvious here... i know im a n00b
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> you just need to put together the code now
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> you can also use jshell to try stuff out
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/974060029080649758/unknown.png
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> Yeah my first itteration works fine like you just described.. the problem is when i want itterate over the the same array again. It returns null
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> can a line contain more than one member?
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> Nope
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> It can contain either a member, or their boats... but each on seperate lines
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> You could uncomment the println to check if you even get each line in the loop
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> yeah, the str returns each line fine... but if would put sysout(num) under the split, it will return "null" the second iteration
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> `num` should be a local variable as well
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> you only use it locally once to it's best to avoid any global effects
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> It was actually a local variable when i encountered the problem. So i tried to set it outside of the for loop, but the problem still exists üò¶
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> Also, i really appreciate all the help guys. You are awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
23:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Have you applied all the changes from above? Can you share your code again?
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> I am currently changing it üôÇ Just give me a few min... also if i use arraylist, can i still iterate through it with "i"?
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> The `split` method should never return `null`
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> i cant do members.add(i) = new member
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> oh wait
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> you don't need the `i`, you can add at the end of the list
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> thats stupid lol
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> yeah
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> sorry im stupdi xD
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/974063247487549530/unknown.png
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> Guys i love you so much! Its working now üòÑ I have no idea why num was returning null before, but atleast its working now xD If you know what might have been wrong previously please let me know üôÇ
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Nice. I don't think the `split` method can return `null` at all, so maybe you put the `println(num)` somewhere where `split` was not called yet.
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Someone in Discord linked to this tweet and I figured I'd take a stab at singing it in my totally not awful fake accent: https://twitter.com/bhilburn/status/971019559095427075/photo/1

23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <k2d222> is this related to the nvidia leaks?
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Saiborg> iirc i had it right under  String[] num = str.split(":");.... But maybe my memory is betraying me xD Well it works anyways now, so big thanks üôÇ
