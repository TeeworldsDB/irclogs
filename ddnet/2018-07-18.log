01:46 < weez17> the nightly was built with bam and it doesn't change resolution. in my cmake build there is no such issue
07:57 <@heinrich5991> bam can no longer be used for compiling ddnet
07:57 <@heinrich5991> weez17: maybe it's some mingw/msvc issue?
08:03 <+weez17> I can fix the hidpi problem on macos following the build instructions in README.md
08:03 <+weez17> but the nightly build is different. I didn't test with mingw/msvc either
08:07 <@heinrich5991> eh, sorry, I thought you were talking about windows
08:07 <@heinrich5991> weez17: do you build on macos or do you cross-compile from linux to mac?
08:07 <@heinrich5991> the official build is the result of a cross-compilation from linux
08:09 <+weez17> I build on macos
08:11 <@heinrich5991> mhk, so we might have a problem there
08:32 <+weez17> the nightly build runs in maximum resolution everytime no matter what the setting is
17:03 <+Im__corneum> so.. is the thing with the serverside dummy going to be coded or will it be forgotten soon?
17:04 <+Ryozuki> add it as a github issue or it will be forgotten
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even then, it's not guaranteed that it will be implemented
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unless you find someone willing to do the hard work
17:07 <+Im__corneum> thats a no then :/
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (but I agree with Ryozuki, creating a github issue is a good first step)
17:09 <+Im__corneum> even that didnt bring much in the past. devs almost only do fixes right?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, time isn't endless ^^
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Ryozuki just coded a whole new gameplay feature
17:10 <+Im__corneum> for like a year. and i havent seen much of it
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it was only just merged ^^
17:16 <+AmuCookie> u can find server side dummy here
17:16 <+AmuCookie> https://github.com/Pikotee/teeworlds/tree/dummy
17:18 <+tght> uh
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> rip @ZombieToad
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> the oldest troll in tw wont work anymore
20:04 <@deen> Hm, not sure if I should discuss DDoS related stuff publicly here, but nfoservers just posted:
20:04 <@deen> Your latest high-PPS spoofed attacks are causing problems for other customers, and our own management systems, on your physical machine. We understand from your previous statements that you don't want us to filter such attacks upstream, but it will be necessary to do this.
20:04 <@deen> Let us know what type of filter or rate-limit would be best to block these unique attack packets. Absent other information, we would normally create a filter blocking length-32 UDP packets whose payloads start with the hex bytes "1000 0001" -- but we see that you specifically are allowing these packets (except that you have a strange rate-limit that the first 50/s to be blocked). 
20:04 <@deen> I fixed the "strange rate-limit", it was inverted indeed, otherwise what do we want?
20:05 <@deen> heinrich5991, Learath2 ^
20:07 <@heinrich5991> oh god, inverted rate-limit :(
20:08 <@deen> yeah, so normal players can't connect, but DoS gets through :D
