00:13 < bridge> <deen> yes, but only 7 seconds
00:13 < bridge> <deen> ddnet with postgres? 😄
00:13 < bridge> <bencie> thats the vid in the pr
00:14 < bridge> <bencie> 7s ye
00:14 < bridge> <deen> ok, my browser showed 14s and the error at some point
00:15 < bridge> <bencie> ah idk, the youtube link he posted afterwars is 80secs long so thats a bit more useful

00:15 < bridge> <Ewan> what on earth?
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> why not use new normally and do
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan>     CleanerFunctions.push([pKernel, pClient]() {
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan>         pKernel->Shutdown();
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan>         delete pKernel;
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan>         [&pClient]{ pClient->~CClient() };
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan>         free(pClient);
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan>     });
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> why not use new normally and do
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
00:16 < bridge> <Ewan>     CleanerFunctions.push([pKernel, pClient]() {

00:17 < bridge> <Ewan>     });
00:17 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
00:22 < bridge> <Ewan> okay discord is displaying my images in a stupid way so i guess i have to post code snippets instead. poor chillerdragon
00:22 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
00:22 < bridge> <Ewan> static CClient *CreateClient()
00:22 < bridge> <Ewan> {
00:22 < bridge> <Ewan>     CClient *pClient = static_cast<CClient *>(malloc(sizeof(*pClient)));
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan>     mem_zero(pClient, sizeof(CClient));
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan>     return new(pClient) CClient;
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> }
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> 
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> ...
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan>         // Init client
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan>     CClient *pClient = CreateClient();
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> 
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> ...
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan>         // Deinit (client included)
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan>     CleanerFunctions.push([pKernel, pClient]() {
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan>         pKernel->Shutdown();
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan>         delete pKernel;

00:23 < bridge> <Ewan>         free(pClient);
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan>     });
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> why not use new normally and do
00:32 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp

00:52 < bridge> <Ewan> i had syntax highlighting on mobile for like 5 minutes. now it’s gone. where did it go o_O
07:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That looks indeed weird. Maybe it’s allocated with malloc and thus should be freed and the destructor is called manually to make sure it all works fine. Idk if free calls destructors
07:52 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeah free doesnt call any destructor afair
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> it is and that's why but my question is why malloc is being used in the first place
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> free can't call dtor bcus free has no concept of classes or vtables or whatever afaik
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> would using `new` regularly not just do the same thing and put it somewhere in the heap? what's malloc do differently that helps here
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> im trying to understand why because pKernel is constructed & destructed in the exact same way right next to pClient so i can't see how it would be a lifetime thing
08:19 < bridge> <Ewan> which would be irrelevant anyway...
08:20 < bridge> <Ewan> im trying to understand why because pKernel is constructed & destructed in the correct way but in the exact same place as pClient so i can't see how it would be a lifetime thing
08:50 < bridge> <ReiTW> afaik the only diff is that new calls the constructor
09:34 < bridge> <Ewan> ctor is also called with placement new
09:34 < bridge> <ReiTW> what's placement new
09:34 < bridge> <Ewan> that new syntax
09:35 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
09:35 < bridge> <Ewan> void *whatever = whatever();
09:35 < bridge> <Ewan> new T(whatever) objName; 
09:35 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
09:36 < bridge> <ReiTW> probably but malloc itself won't call the constructor ig
09:36 < bridge> <ReiTW> That's ig the only diff
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> `    return new(pClient) CClient;`
09:36 < bridge> <Ewan> with this method memory is allocated and the object is constructed in that memory block
09:37 < bridge> <Ewan> but the block isn't aligned or anything that could help with performance
09:37 < bridge> <Ewan> i have no idea why it's doing this
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> send help on how to google things xd
09:38 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
09:38 < bridge> <Ewan> google can't tell my why whoever wrote this code chose to allocate completely unremarkable memory just to get the same result
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> i have a bunch of speakers that are super old and some dont even work but its fine for me and it sounded nice on my old pc
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> it also can't highlight for me how this is different if it even is at all
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> oic i misunderstood what u were sayign sorry chiller
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> go on
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> my new pc only uses one of the speakers and its now coming from da side 
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> what kind of speakers
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/audio1.png
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> thats what my settings show on my old working pc
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> and here settings on new pc https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1685000292.png
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> ok but how many speakers and what kind
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> idk what kind of speakers do i look like sound technican
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> i have a big box below ma table i think its bass
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> and then 5 on ma desk
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> probably a driver issue
09:40 < bridge> <Ewan> did u used to use aux out jacks and now have a usb dac or something
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> but idk what i am looking for here
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> i used the same cables in the same port
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> the 3 colored thingies
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> i just replugged it to old pc in the same way and there it just works
09:41 < bridge> <Ewan> well old config is 5.1 surround sound which is 5 speakers and 1 sub
09:41 < bridge> <Ewan> new config looks like it's trying to do stereo
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/audio0.png
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> old config like this
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> also sounds nice
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> i think the key difference is the output device being detected as "Line Out - built in audio" vs "speakers - usb audio"
09:41 < bridge> <Ewan> u said this was old config
09:42 < bridge> <Ewan> do you have 2 "Line Out - Built-in Audio"?
09:42 < bridge> <Ewan> did you have 2 "Line Out - Built-in Audio"?
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> i just clicked the configuration tab and changed from stereo to surround 
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> both sound nice
09:42 < bridge> <Ewan> it's working or what
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> only on my old pc
09:43 < bridge> <Ewan> can you list the devices u have on the new pc
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> which shows it as "Line Out" thingiy
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> basically just the "speakers - usb audio"
09:44 <+ChillerDragon> which only reaches one of the 6 speakers .-.
09:44 <+ChillerDragon> and a bunch of garbage devices such as my microphone and my screen xd
09:44 < bridge> <Ewan> google says this will re-detect all pulseaudio devices without restarting the daemon
09:44 < bridge> <Ewan> `pacmd unload-module module-udev-detect && pacmd load-module module-udev-detect`
09:44 < bridge> <Ewan> tell me if you get more devices
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> didnt help ._.
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> i mean it is detected
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> just wrongly i think
09:45 < bridge> <Ewan> same list of devices? or what
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> yes
09:45 < bridge> <Ewan> you would wanna see some sort of aux out hmm
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> wai wiat
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> i restarte gnome settings
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> now i have a zillion devices 
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> x
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> sec
09:46 <+ChillerDragon> ah nvm
09:46 <+ChillerDragon> its all twice xd
09:46 < bridge> <Ewan> sad
09:46 < bridge> <Ewan> can i just get a list tho
09:46 <+ChillerDragon> it doesnt lemme screenshot the mf
09:46 < bridge> <Ewan> weird
09:46 <+ChillerDragon> gnome blocks all kinds of screenshots when the dropdown is open xd
09:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> bwt ChillerDragon do you use pipewire or pulseaudio?
09:46 <+ChillerDragon> pulseaudio
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> on both devices
09:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont think u can use pipewire from gnome settings
09:47 < bridge> <Ewan> but idk
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> fakin hell i have a all day zoom meeting in 10mins im gonna get brain damage from this sound xd
09:48 < bridge> <ReiTW> mute zoom
09:48 < bridge> <ReiTW> play doom
09:48 <+ChillerDragon> ez
09:48 < bridge> <Ewan> `pacmd list-cards`?
09:48 < bridge> <Ewan> tell output
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/rX
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i should somehow undouble my devices again xd

09:50 < bridge> <Ewan> wild i'm not seeing any built in audio
09:50 < bridge> <Ewan> just generic usb/spdif devices
09:50 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PulseAudio/Troubleshooting>
09:50 < bridge> <Ewan> follow 5.11
09:50 < bridge> <Ewan> see if that helps
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> hdmi? xd
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> i dont want hdmi sound
09:51 < bridge> <Ewan> hdmi is audio/video
09:51 < bridge> <Ewan> so gpu does audio when hdmi is on
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> is it not related to hdm cable?
09:52 < bridge> <Ewan> if you're plugging into the aux jacks on your pc then no
09:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ima\_6f465dc.jpeg
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> shit trippy image

09:53 < bridge> <ReiTW> drugs picture
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> dose ma sound cables
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> no hdmi involved in my sound
09:54 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hmm I don't know if you missunderstood but the 5.11 was about
09:54 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> > This might happen if PulseAudio use the wrong output device. Firstly, set up proper card profile:
09:55 <+ChillerDragon> my question is how to make "speakers - usb audio" show up as "line out - built-in audio" but thats not googleable xd
09:55 < bridge> <Ewan> 5.11 will help you, it's outlining what to do if only spdif devices are showing up (which is what's happening in your case)
09:55 <+ChillerDragon> ah 5.11
09:55 <+ChillerDragon> i was at 5.1
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> ah lol
09:56 <+ChillerDragon> xd
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> in my experience spdif in linux audio always just means generic digital audio
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> same protocol and whatever
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> usb
09:56 < bridge> <Ewan> all same
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> let me know how it goes. i don't imagine you'd want to mess with audio stuff while in a conference
10:19 < bridge> <Ewan> so i go make rice pudding
10:21 <+ChillerDragon> xd nice rice pudding
10:21 <+ChillerDragon> yea it said all the profiles were not found even those that showed up in auto complete
10:22 <+ChillerDragon> the conf got delayed i booted one last time into my old rig to get all the deivce infos there to then compare it to the new
11:07 < bridge> <Ewan> Yea try booting into old disk if u can
11:07 < bridge> <Ewan> see if it's a hardware issue
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> ou boii this new cpu is amazing
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> compiling ddnet is so much more fun
11:08 < bridge> <Ewan> ahh
11:08 < bridge> <Ewan> which cpu
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> as a make user i have to break my year long habit of -j12 
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> you have more than 12 now
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> wuh
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> yes pog
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> but which cpu
11:09 <+ChillerDragon> 13th Gen Intel i9-13900K (32) @ 5.500GHz
11:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is it ok to leave a review on a draft?
11:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why not.
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> Ask them if they intend to change it before exiting the draft stage
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> before you even waste your time analyzing that aspect
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> Nice
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> Big dollars
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> I am on the i9 9400f
11:13 < bridge> <Ewan> Compile times are miserable
11:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well i left it
11:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6663#pullrequestreview-1443420954>
11:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont @ me
11:16 < bridge> <Ewan> Lol
11:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks did u have a draft for split view?
11:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i remember talking about this
11:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I've a branch for that yes
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> Oh split view is a real thing
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> Nice
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> kdaniel and I were hypothesizing a team spectate mode where you would be shown all the action by way of a camera pan
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> and if there were 2 groups with movement activity somewhere that you can't see both at once, it'd split view
11:19 < bridge> <Ewan> this will make that easy
11:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Ewan Green i got reminded of portal cooop
11:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u press tab and see a smal camera
11:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> of other  player
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's missing network support mostly and client support is not great
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/tree/useless_mini_screen
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or

11:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/tree/useless_mini_screen2
11:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks following the vulkano tut i made a compute shader program
11:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 164 lines to multiply 65536 values by 12 in workgroups of 1024
11:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:24 < bridge> <Ewan> Never played the coop
11:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im here now https://vulkano.rs/images/image_creation.html
11:24 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds easy given what they had going though
11:24 < bridge> <Ewan> for the portal views and whatnot
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sounds ok xD
11:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u gotta make memory allocatos
11:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for everything
11:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> command buffer, buffer, pipeline
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yep
11:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> descriptor sets
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's weird first time u do it
11:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u gotta make memory allocators
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Advantage is. U never do useless allocations if u careful
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's like GC vs non GC xD
11:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> one thing, if i got it correct: u need a pipeline to make a descriptor set, but then u can use that set on any other  pipeline that matches it?
11:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or smth like that
11:27 < bridge> <Ewan> Jup would you know why pClient is init in such a weird way
11:27 < bridge> <Ewan> I mentioned it earlier but it got buried
11:27 < bridge> <Ewan> Ya here
11:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > In order to create a descriptor set, you'll need to know the layout that it is targeting. We do this by using the "Pipeline" trait and calling .layout() on our pipeline to obtain the pipeline's layout. Next we'll fetch the layout specific to the pass that we want to target by using .set_layouts().get(0) where zero indicates the first index of the pass that we are targeting.
11:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > 
11:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > Once you have created a descriptor set, you may also use it with other pipelines, as long as the bindings' types match those the pipelines' shaders expect. But Vulkan requires that you provide a pipeline whenever you create a descriptor set; you cannot create one independently of any particular pipeline.
11:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar> well a layout is like a definition how it looks
11:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar> the pipelines are not directly related to this
11:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but the pipelines know what descriptors they will use, so here is where it has to match the descriptor set
11:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why did u switch chat
11:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> gotta support chillers amazing work
11:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but
11:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is it made in rust
11:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :santatrollet:
11:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> is discord made in rust?
11:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xd
11:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> backend
11:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://discord.com/blog/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust
11:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i dunno how it works in vulkano, but what you quoted sounds very confusing to me tbh
11:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111225633872289832/image.png
11:34 < bridge> <Ewan> just saw the review MultiplierStuff lmfao
11:34 < ws-client> <Jupstar> u can bind multiple descriptor sets to one pipeline
11:34 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and 2 different pipelines can bind different descriptor sets, while still sharing one in common
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Nice that u already work with compute shaders
11:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks well
11:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the tut starts with them
11:37 < bridge> <Ryozuki> which i think may make sense
11:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> since u dont need image math or smth
11:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I see
11:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but now i go with image
11:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111226870697054250/image.png
11:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I c
11:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i admit tho without following this i would be lost
11:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there is simply a lot to know
11:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> upload, download, buffers etc
11:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We should also implement a compute shader, to speed up zooming out far
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> With a ray casting approach
11:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> pog
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Like patiga did. Just that we don't modify the buffer we already have ^^
11:40 < bridge> <Ewan> im out of the loop what are you reading ryozuki?
11:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111227367101300847/image.png
11:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im learning vulkan
11:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://vulkano.rs
11:41 < bridge> <Ewan> ya i figured but looks like rust docs
11:41 < bridge> <Ewan> o
11:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> using this lib
11:41 < bridge> <Ewan> sweet
11:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder if i would be in over my head trying to kill 2 birds with one stone following this guyde
11:41 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder if i would be in over my head trying to kill 2 birds with one stone following this guide
11:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hm i think its too much
11:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> vulkan is not simple
11:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also its threaded, it already deals with Arcs and sync
11:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> altho the lib handles it nicely for u
11:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```rust
11:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> let future = sync::now(device.clone())

11:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well not threaded, but u need to sync with the gpu
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't agree with their documentation lol
11:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
11:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg jopsti you wont belive new pc tw is as glitchy as old pc tw
11:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
11:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat did you say about the washing effect i already pressed all kinds of buttons in settings
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Host cached memory is perfect for uploading in a sense of a staging buffer
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It has no coherent memory overhead
11:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar> Chiller: in the monitor look for overwrite mode
11:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar> or anti ghosting
11:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar> is it also so glitchy while using it with openbox? :^)
11:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i dont trust GNOME bro :D
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
11:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar> maybe they force tripple buffering
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> probably not
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt fully test yesterday
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also was diff screen so :shrug:
11:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sadly i can not boot into openbox during meeting xd
11:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i like gnome
11:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i like it lot less since yesterday xd
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I implemented a multi threaded allocator using it for the playground, so I can write png data directly into the drivers memory. Saves some memcpy
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> All in for performance;)
11:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jopsti btw i have 400 fps rn xd
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Gnome should not be allowed being called part of linux
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It gives a wrong impression about Linux desktop
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ppl will think windows is good
11:53 < ws-client> <Jupstar> 400 fps lmao
11:53 < ws-client> <Jupstar> on basically the best desktop computr u can buy rn
11:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its basically same as my old pc
11:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i actually looked under my table for a sec because i assumed i forgot which pc i use
11:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> all is the same
11:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> same gnome window bugs xd same fps same screen glitch
11:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> feels home
11:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe i just have to downgrade gnome? xd
11:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i dunno bro, but if it works in openbox then it is at least not directly a driver issue
11:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> at least not in a sense that the driver if only ddnet existed would suck so hard xd
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is there a way to make kde not loog ugly af?
11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is it even better?
11:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> sry but where in the world does gnome good anywhere good? xd
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it hot
11:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> it looks like it was designed for tablets
11:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> big fat close buttons for grannies
12:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ChillerDragon: https://store.kde.org/p/1122643/
12:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> kde gnome shell? xd
12:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar> apparently xd, but i dunno where to download it
12:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> store.kde.org xd
12:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> maaan i want to get this gnome to work
12:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> my screen settings are empty af
12:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> i dont see any ghosts or overwrite
12:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> only thing i find is overdrive
12:02 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but arent u apple fan
12:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> and freesync
12:02 < ws-client> <Jupstar> back in the days
12:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> https://store.kde.org/p/2029089/
12:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> yes
12:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> there are plenty of macos theme clones
12:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> very hot
12:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ah yeah
12:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> overdrive was the word
12:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> sry my brain not made for human language
12:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> ok i got all the overdrive
12:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> freesync is off?
12:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> on
12:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> turn off
12:04 < ws-client> <Jupstar> freesync = vsync on the monitor
12:04 < ws-client> <Jupstar> :joy:
12:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> overdrive OFF - smart OD - picture quality - balance - speed
12:04 < ws-client> <Jupstar> just play around until u happy
12:04 < ws-client> <Jupstar> it depends heavily on the setup anyway
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> nooo
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> i pressed a button
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> now my 3rd screen went black xd
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> how xd
12:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar> one problem less to care about
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> my chat was on it xd
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> ok fuck it ill give kde another try how to properly install that?
12:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i dunno, install kde-plasma
12:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar> or kde-desktop
12:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar> or kde-full
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> wat diss
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> wat u got?
12:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> one of these packages
12:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i have debian
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> xd
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> nice i like debian
12:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but on my arch i think i used kde-full
12:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> or similar name
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> kde-bloat
12:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i am only on debian bcs least amount of self compiling packages :D
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> ?
12:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar> gnome is just as bloated xD
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> wdym compiling packages
12:09 < ws-client> <Jupstar> on arch u get many stuff only with AUR
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> a
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> i compile way more on debian tbh
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> to get more recent software xd
12:09 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i compile specific stuff my own
12:09 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but e.g. rocm takes like 40 minutes to compile lmao
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> wat dis
12:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar> amd's cuda
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> gfx juspti
12:11 < bridge> <Ewan> As much as I support KDE in their educational efforts & their Frameworks, I think GNOME is a better DE than Plasma
12:11 < ws-client> <Jupstar> :joy:
12:11 < ws-client> <Jupstar> better in being broken?
12:11 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i used gnome for almost 2 years
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> better how?
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> only reason why i like gnome is because it looks good out of the box and there is much stuff on stackoveflow about it
12:12 < bridge> <Ewan> Simpler to use and feels better
12:12 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and u used KDE for how long?
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> me?
12:12 < bridge> <Ewan> A few months
12:12 < ws-client> <Jupstar> so u never used it
12:12 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i see
12:12 < bridge> <Ewan> GNOME for about the same
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> a few months is time
12:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar> chiller just get gansta and install i3
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> i thought about it
12:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but sadly even these simplistic "DE" are often buggy
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> i like ryos screenshots
12:13 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> embrace the dark side install dwm
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> im scared about bugs there ye
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> and also too lazy to learn keybindings
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> i like my gnome keybindings
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> they are the same as on windows 
12:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111235775036661871/image.png
12:14 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i tried ddnet in like all of them, when implemented mouse changes :D
12:14 < bridge> <Ewan> I liked what budgie was going for before they switched from GTK to Enlightenment
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> oh no
12:14 < bridge> <Ewan> but it was still not super stable
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> will kde affect my mouse?
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> i got gnome aim 
12:15 < ws-client> <Jupstar> no, ddnet uses raw input
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> pog
12:15 < bridge> <Ewan> which fullscreen mode u use? i *think* real fullscreen becomes exclusive to windowing system
12:15 < ws-client> <Jupstar> except u disabled it over cl_mouseold
12:15 < ws-client> <Jupstar> or whatever its called :D
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> @Mr.Gh0s7 have you tried it? i thought about it too
12:15 < ws-client> <Jupstar> in theory it should, but i can force my compositor to stay active
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> i like suckless
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> https://dwm.suckless.org/
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> you mean this? is it bug free? and 17k fps?
12:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah I have been using dwm for about 1.5 years
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> oh nice
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> maybe ill try dwm before i try kde
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i like hot dog linux
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> oh dwm is awesome
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> xd
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> hot dog?
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> but it and kde are like polar opposites
12:17 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it's very easy if you have a pocket @gotroyb to install it and apply his patches for you. Even my lil bro (10 yold) uses it xDD
12:17 < ws-client> <Jupstar> who needs GUI if u have terminal UI
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> agreed
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> my little brothers use linux mint for homeschool because it was the fastest to install on multiple computers & easy to maintain
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> stable and whatever
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> good product
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> u all flexin w siblings or wot
12:19 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone here tried to compile ddnet with musl libc? or do they not have cpp implementations. i forget
12:19 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I didn't flex I only said 2 of them
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> my 2yo sister compiles her own kernel and then uses no wm at all just the raw linux tty
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> you also have 2yo sister damn
12:20 <+ChillerDragon> yes everything in that sentence is fully true
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm being trolled by an air conditioner with wings
12:20 <+ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
12:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @Ewan libc usually doesnt contain any cpp impl
12:21 < ws-client> <Jupstar> what is musl libc useful for?
12:21 < bridge> <Ewan> its claim is to speed
12:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> jupstr such web client enjoyer
12:21 < bridge> <Ewan> but compat is something of an issue
12:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> pog
12:21 < bridge> <Ewan> void and alpine use it
12:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupsti u here for the memes or you actually like it? xd
12:22 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i like it
12:22 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it's also very lightweight. PostmarketOS uses it
12:22 < ws-client> <Jupstar> it feels faster than discord, and i dont see other channels
12:22 < bridge> <Ewan> the ws-client takeover
12:22 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice 
12:22 < ws-client> <Jupstar> its defs not perfect tho
12:23 < bridge> <Ewan> link?
12:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am so used to weechat im having  a hardtime switching away from it
12:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/
12:23 < ws-client> <Jupstar> if u make it open codable, i'd fix the css issues xD
12:23 < ws-client> <ewane> hello fellow ddnet developers
12:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/discord-irc/blob/master/src/style.css
12:23 < ws-client> <Mr.Gh0s7> gimme laser for icon
12:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u gotta rename 
12:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for new icon
12:23 < ws-client> <ewane> i love it but what's up with the margins everywhere
12:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it looks at the hex of your first character
12:24 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> Could I add it to Teeworlds Data too easily?
12:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ultra scuffed xd
12:24 < ws-client> <ewane> would you want to
12:24 < bridge> <zogtib> because you can handle cleanly many tui-s
12:24 < ws-client> <ewane> ahhh bridge is fucking with me
12:24 < ws-client> <ewane> i sent that before zogtib's message
12:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> discord bug
12:24 < ws-client> <ewane> likely
12:25 < bridge> <zogtib> not speed but simplicity and lightweightness
12:25 < bridge> <Ewan> that was fun but i prefer my 500MiB memory footprint web app for trivial chat thanks
12:25 < bridge> <Ewan> this is just software now
12:25 < bridge> <Ewan> what a world
12:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> is that so
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't see how a libc can be any simpler than another libc
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> speaking about implementation of the standard at least
12:27 < bridge> <zogtib> prob simplicity in the implementation, not in what is being implemented
12:27 < bridge> <Ewan> yea alright
12:28 <+ChillerDragon> !jup what do you even mean by open codable? xd
12:28 < chillerbot1> @Jupstar ✪
12:28 < ws-client> <Jupstar> so i dont have to setup my own instance to code it and use github
12:28 < bridge> <zogtib> see this https://musl.libc.org/about.html about what musl is trying to achieve
12:28 <+ChillerDragon> setting up a instance is simple
12:29 <+ChillerDragon> but i can add a link css of juspti.com/style.css if you want
12:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i had honestly forgotten musl wasn't speed focused
12:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i never really used it
12:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar> u wont need it anyway, except u want to code in pure c
12:29 < bridge> <zogtib> it cares about speed but won't sell everything for it
12:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar> for cpp just use the standard lib
12:30 <+ChillerDragon> you have a place to server css files juspsti?
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> what u talkin about jup
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> usually ppl don't code c with a particular libc in mind lol
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> that's the user's choice
12:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ok, but then what do you need it for :D
12:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar> since u asked if someone compiled with it
12:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i was curious
12:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar> Chiller: i dunno, make vscode-server and host this website as project xdd
12:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar> then we can do anarchy coding
12:31 < ws-client> <NotChillerDragon> :wave:
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is 17.0 release today?
12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> hope so
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> need to know asap, gentoo will be the first to have the repo updated
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz master race
12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> has the chinese community already test it?
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @TsFreddie
12:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i remember someone said they want to test
12:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> we should test it at least 1-2 days xD
12:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar> before all chinese cant use client anymore
12:33 < bridge> <Ewan> yo are we summoning fred
12:33 < bridge> <Ewan> mr benson
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ^
12:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @FightFire any news
12:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar if you have a vps and a webserver you can edit a file with vim there and i can make it live on this production website by linking your css
12:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i really need to implement pings
12:37 < ws-client> <Jupstar> clever, but then i can also host my own chat? xd
12:37 < ws-client> <Jupstar> what if i want to make the general feel better
12:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uhm yea but potentially less effort?
12:37 < ws-client> <Jupstar> or add new features 
12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hosting your own chat is also not much effort id say
12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 1 env file edit and 2 install commands
12:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i should rent some vps without using my real name and setup a vscode-server instance like that
12:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and see what happens
12:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> :joy:
12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk vscode-server
12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but sounds fun
12:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> its vscode, just that u use it in browser
12:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar> instead of downloading it
12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i hate those xd
12:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and it can use the terminal? xd
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so its full ssh access?
12:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yes
12:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> its completely unsafe
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just rent a vps and give everyone ssh access
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no need for vscode
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> would also be fun
12:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and considering humans are evil, it will be abused
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> i love the idea
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> worked well w my raspberry
12:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xD
12:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> learath is evil
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just dont give lerato access
12:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and then we good
12:40 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but u also gave him fcking root access xD
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nana
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it was just pi user
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i didnt even had to reformat the drive
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> was super chill
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but now its root
12:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> since its docker
12:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar> but anyway
12:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and docker is free priv escalation
12:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar> vscode-server is pw protected
12:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar> so we can join ddnet server, share pw
12:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and its all safe
12:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet server as secure channel xd
12:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar> bcs tw chat is encrypted af
12:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we need dms here?
12:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xd
12:42 < bridge> <Ewan> lmao
12:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> since ddnet staff hates me and doesnt want to give me another irc bridge
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe we can just add one more channel here where i can shittalk w jupsti
12:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bridged to some random empty irc channel
12:43 < bridge> <Ewan> they really won't give you a general bridge?
12:44 < bridge> <Ewan> and i don't think it's that they hate you... i think it's that you're the One Guy who doesn't use discord xd
12:44 < bridge> <Ewan> they are accommodating enough i think
12:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i take it personal
12:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> join Repeek Ethami and share pwd there :troll:
12:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar> Chiller: we should host a second IRC server that we abuse to emulate stuff like "<name> is typing ..."
12:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar> stuff like that
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean extending the irc protocol?
12:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye thought about that
12:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yeah, ez
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> probably actually ez
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there are like 100 line python irc servers
12:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but editing the websocket irc client is probably annoying since its some js lib for irc lcient
12:51 < bridge> <Learath2> Does anyone know if in 8086 assembly an addition into AL would carry into AH?
12:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what you hacking lerato?
12:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar> he forgot his win95 pw
12:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd

12:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> resident assembler
12:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Writing AL, AH, or AX leaves other bytes unmodified in the full AX/EAX/RAX, for historical reasons. i.e. it has to merge a new AL into the full RAX, for example. (In 32 or 64-bit code, prefer a movzx eax, byte [mem] or movzx eax, word [mem] load if you don't specifically want this merging: Why doesn't GCC use partial registers?)
12:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> does this answer u?
12:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2
12:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Writing partial registers entails a performance penalty on many x86 processors because they are renamed into different physical registers from their whole counterpart when written. (For more about register renaming enabling out-of-order execution, see this Q&A).
12:59 < bridge> <Learath2> Uhhh, this sounds like x86
12:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh
12:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i forgot u asked for that
12:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xdxd
12:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> mybad
13:00 < bridge> <Learath2> Also doesn’t answer my question anyway, I’m looking to know if say `MOV AL, FFh; ADD AL, 1` does that modify AH?
13:01 < bridge> <Learath2> The original spec says it will definitely set the carry flag, but idk if it’ll ruin AH

13:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Should I put a Pizza in the oven or drive to makke donalds😞
13:40 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i guess both are equally shit, but the pizza is cheaper
13:45 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i give u tutorial: 1. buy noodles 2. buy tomato sauce 3. buy freezed vegetables 4. put vegetables with oil into a pan, roast them for 10 minutes. also put noodles for whatever the packaging says into a cooking pot (usually takes around 10 minutes too) 5. after 5 minutes, put the tomato sauce into it
13:45 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i recommend arabiata tomato sauce
13:45 < ws-client> <Jupstar> is also faster than making a pizza if we consider the absolute time.. ofc the disadvantage is that u have to be in the kitchen the whole time
13:46 < bridge> <val jameson> hello
13:46 < ws-client> <Jupstar> hey, how are you
13:47 < bridge> <val jameson> hungry
13:47 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thanks for the tutorial xd I even have spaghetti at home

16:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon3> ryo what made you switch to gentoo?
16:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon3> curiosity?
16:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon3> what made you stay?
16:16 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think heinrich encouraged him xD
16:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> encouraged who to do what?
16:17 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ryo to install gentoo
16:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lol

16:19 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ryozuki: are you using it?
16:19 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> heinrich5991: hence I want you to try it out 😄```
16:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye nix i understand the hype
16:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the package manager seems good
16:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gentoos package manager just seems annoyingly slow due to compile
16:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what gives
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> chiler
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u didnt read my blog
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im sad
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/blog/daily-gentoo/
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with gentoo you get max perf
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and max control
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> you have full control how something is compiled
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and features it has
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and optimizations
16:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also you can say you use gentoo, which otherwise u cant
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also can flex my neofetch

16:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i read only ur tw blogs
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think u dont know what u say with "gentoo package manager is slow"
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there is a diferente to compiling and downloading
16:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also portage is amazing, use flags are pog
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage
16:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what jupsti said
16:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> compiling is slower than donwloading binaries
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but u get native cpu perf
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for example, the downloaded binaries are compiled targeting x86-v1
16:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mostly compile to have debug symbols and get proper crashlogs etc
16:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i compile for native
16:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> never compiled for perf
16:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> which is v3
16:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does it impact speed?
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No doubt it is amazing^^
16:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i always thought selfcompiled is slower because noob flags and pro production shipped binaries are well optimized
16:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> When we have 32 core cpu i might do
16:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we?
16:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is that a yes to becoming flat mates?
16:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> he is communist suddnely

19:19 < bridge> <Chairn> it won't as reported by Ryozuki
19:19 < bridge> <Chairn> easiest way is also to simply try 🙂
19:20 < bridge> <Learath2> I do not have an 8086 at hand so it's rather tough to try
19:21 < bridge> <Chairn> oO? what kind of cpu do you have?
19:23 < bridge> <Learath2> While I do get your point, it's kind of naive to assume that the x86-64 processors we have now mimic an 8086 from almost 50 years ago
19:23 < bridge> <Chairn> but it's true
19:23 < bridge> <Chairn> intel decided to keep compatibility with all their x86 processor products
19:24 < bridge> <Chairn> kinda tricky for them because i guess it's kinda hard sometimes when you just want to push better designs but that break compat
19:59 < bridge> <deen> Intel wants to get rid of that btw: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/envisioning-future-simplified-architecture.html

20:01 < bridge> <Iza> Multiple people have reported this problem already, it has something to do with the SDL2.dll file as far as I know
20:01 < bridge> <deen> Oh no...
20:02 < bridge> <deen> @Robyt3 So I guess we have to downgrade SDL2 yet again breaking IME?
20:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @deen we are sure we didnt build in debug mode?
20:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we should maybe try official build
20:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> else we should really create an issue on sdl github
20:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its buggy since 2 years lmao
20:31 < bridge> <deen> According to config.log -O2 is used

20:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 1 cent?
20:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isnt ipv4 like super expensive
20:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like at least 2bucks a month
20:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nah i dunno
20:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> some vps hosters give it cheaper if u dont want ipv4
20:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
20:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because its expensive af
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but not 2 bucks
20:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they already had the IP before
20:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but +2bucks if you want 2 ipv4
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they are part of some pools
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tru
20:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my isp offers a static ipv4 for 4 bucks a month
20:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so you pro ipv6?
20:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because new?
20:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> "new"
20:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ipv6 is probably older than me

20:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> our computers are old already
21:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @deen does haskell have the stack on the heap? how do they deal with recursion, is it always tail recursive?
21:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> can u get a stack overflow
21:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> isnt the stack always on the heap strictly speaking 😄
21:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> uh oh
21:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mainly ask cuz the overflow
21:15 < bridge> <Learath2> Fwiw a lot of the commercial planes you fly in are built in the early 2000s and the 90s, they are just retrofitted with some new equipment
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> are built, correct
21:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i doubt they'll use latest intel CPUs xd
21:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iirc
21:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> europe has newer fleet
21:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a something
21:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> right?
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also: dont fly, problem solved xd
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in 15 years we want to be C02 neutral
21:17 < bridge> <Learath2> They still use their ancient flight management computers, not even close to latest 😄
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> LMAO
21:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in 15 years we want to be CO2 neutral
21:18 < bridge> <Learath2> Average fleet age is about 10-12 years in europe iirc
21:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in 15 years we can upgrade hardware 😂

21:18 < bridge> <Learath2> built to last

21:19 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/7159
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh nice they already have an issue for that

21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i also asked the steam player
21:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lets wait for her answer
21:21 < bridge> <Learath2> The latest revision of the b737 fmc is running on a motorola 68040 😄
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> how long do u think they get their ROI on 1 plane
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ?
21:24 < bridge> <Learath2> uff, hard to say, but definitely about half a decade atleast, it's insanely expensive
21:27 < bridge> <Learath2> say you operate a b737 that's 7.63 million $ for the base plane, say your configuration seats 200 and airlines report about 2$ profit per seat, that's ALOT of flights before you get even close to breaking even 😛
21:28 < bridge> <Learath2> 19k flights before you break even, that's about 70% of the life time of an airliner, so after that it's all profit 😛
21:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but im sure companies get help
21:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> from goverments
21:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also not all flights are passanger
21:29 < bridge> <Learath2> I just took a look at IATA's report for passenger flights, they do indeed have supplemental income in the form of subsidies and cargo

22:02 < bridge> <Robyt3> works for me
22:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i see this one with time
22:02 < bridge> <Avolicious> Mhmmm, interesting
22:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> did u update client btw
22:02 < bridge> <Avolicious> Gonna restart the client
22:03 < bridge> <Avolicious> Okay, second time I started the client only blackscreen
22:03 < bridge> <Avolicious> Killed it via task manager, restart, now it works 😄
22:03 < bridge> <Avolicious> strange
22:08 < bridge> <Learath2> Waait, you made the value positive?
22:08 < bridge> <Learath2> Not you Avo, @Ryozuki
22:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
22:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> uhm
22:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it was positive i think
22:09 < bridge> <Avolicious> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/1d30462e503d0ba909185120b2973c9605cb8f29
22:10 < bridge> <Learath2> `// time is sent as a positive value, but sometimes buggy servers sent it as negative`
22:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that comment is mine and is wrong
22:10 < bridge> <Learath2> Soo, time used to be sent negative?
22:10 < bridge> <Avolicious> It was so before
22:11 < bridge> <Avolicious> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111385995766661302/image.png
22:11 < bridge> <Avolicious> Old server version before 17.0 update
22:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> players sent it positive
22:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but sometimes 1 or 2 were negative
22:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway
22:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> time works now
22:13 < bridge> <Learath2> Isn't it supposed to be always negative?
22:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no
22:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 the client turns it negative
22:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iirc
22:14 < bridge> <Learath2> That is absurd, what?
22:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 AH
22:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nono
22:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its negative
22:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> when the time is sent
22:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ingame
22:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> on master http it isnt
22:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats how it is
22:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 look on onfinishes
22:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the time is turned
22:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 look on onfinished
22:16 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ttime = -(int)time
22:16 < bridge> <Learath2> I don't see how that would ever happen. Both the serverinfo message and the http master code just use `CClient::m_Score`
22:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> look at my pr
22:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> .
22:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/1d30462e503d0ba909185120b2973c9605cb8f29#diff-4b7e0de54578478dbb720a146e73785264c55592e8ba622a241e7eb0af5e2975R352
22:18 < bridge> <Ryozuki> negative for in game times
22:21 < bridge> <Learath2> I'm like 99% sure it's supposed to be negative everywhere
22:25 < bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, I guess it's fine, since no one really knew what was supposed to be the standard everyone just spammed abs() everywhere
22:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
22:28 < bridge> <Chairn> it's negative so that higher score which are in fact negative number of seconds, thus shorter times, appear on top
22:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i fixed it
22:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im the standard
22:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u can refer to me in the future thanks
22:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :TOOBASED:
22:29 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, I was trying to think why the scoreboards suddenly inverted
22:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well
22:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the inverted is cuz heinrich change
22:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i fixed it
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in fact
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i tested it with http, with old udp protocol
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and finishing ingame, too
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz there was a issue the finish time didnt update
22:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats fixed too
22:37 < bridge> <Learath2> Hm, I have a sneaking suspicion this new sorting function doesn't satisfy the requirements of `Compare`
22:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111393244853571585/image.png
22:40 < bridge> <Learath2> comp(-5, -8) == comp(-8, -5)
22:40 < bridge> <Learath2> That breaks strict weak ordering
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u can fix it
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i aint touching that code
22:40 < bridge> <Voxel> this could be optimized
22:40 < bridge> <Voxel> too much nesting
22:40 < bridge> <Learath2> someone is spooked 😄
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dont wanna spend more time in this
22:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
22:41 < bridge> <Learath2> Ah, you are too cool for it, I see
22:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> more like lazy
22:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but yeah, u are talking to a rust user u see
22:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
22:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_WalkToBus:751433825372078121>
22:43 < bridge> <Learath2> comes in, breaks my strict weak ordering, too cool to fix it
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> was it not broken before
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and is it broken now
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the sort works
22:43 < bridge> <Learath2> What is the standard now for scorekind time?
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> on my machine
22:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/works-on-my-machine-ryan-gosling-works-on-my-gif-24523830
22:44 < bridge> <Voxel> ```cpp
22:44 < bridge> <Voxel> return Score0 > Score 1```
22:44 < bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111394278246195270/image0.jpg
22:44 < bridge> <Learath2> The sort invokes UB if scorekind == time, and if two players have unequal negative score
22:44 < bridge> <Voxel> ```cpp
22:44 < bridge> <Voxel> return Score0 > Score 1;```
22:44 < bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111394278246195270/image0.jpg
22:44 < bridge> <Learath2> You fool, you forgot to consider the equality case, 0 points
22:44 < bridge> <Voxel> tell that to whoever wrote that piece of code
22:45 < bridge> <Voxel> oh wait shit right
22:45 < bridge> <Learath2> No the equality drops down as intended so it can be compared using names
22:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cpp devs
22:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> <a:TeaSip:1018688327773323387>
22:45 < bridge> <Learath2> `if(Score1 != Score0) return Score0 > Score1;` is what you are looking for I guess
22:46 < bridge> <Voxel> ```cpp
22:46 < bridge> <Voxel> if(Score0 != Score1)
22:46 < bridge> <Voxel>     return Score0 > Score1;```
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the only code i added was the score kind time branch
22:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the other is old code
22:46 < bridge> <Voxel> @heinr
22:46 < bridge> <Avolicious> Rewrite it in rust 😏
22:46 < bridge> <Learath2> and that branch has the issue, anyway I'll fix it after an episode of konosuba
22:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> did u watch vinland saga
22:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> next episode is gona be epic
22:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> holy shit
22:47 < bridge> <Learath2> not yet, it's on my list of things to watch
22:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oshi no ko too
22:48 < bridge> <Learath2> Are negative times a real thing?
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/kana-arima-kana-look-out-window-oshi-no-ko-my-star-pieyon-gif-26188269
22:48 < bridge> <Learath2> Like do actual servers send it along with scorekind time ever?
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> negative times are real INGAME
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i told u
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> omg
22:48 < bridge> <Learath2> Is that what I asked?
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The season is not over yet?
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk
22:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i cant read
22:49 < bridge> <Learath2> whatever, I'll figure it out
22:49 < bridge> <Avolicious> No, guess not
22:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u are a C dev u got the smarts
22:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> on the http negative times are not send
22:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a negative time means unfinished
22:51 < bridge> <Voxel> god i want to code something now but im stuck at work and i know im 100% going to sleep when i get home
22:52 < bridge> <Headshot> :troll:
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Code in ur brain
22:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i do that
22:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but abstract
22:53 < bridge> <Voxel> I already got a segfault
22:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> like thinking how to structure
22:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not code directly
22:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and going to the toilet is the best
22:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> when ur stuck
22:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also sleep
22:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> iget ideas just before sleeping
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I mostly when showering
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's my creative minutes
22:56 < bridge> <Voxel> a part of me wants to know how to optimize code but i think ddnet is optimized the best it can for what it can do
22:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its better to say
22:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its optimized the best "for what i currently know"
22:59 < bridge> <Voxel> well what DOES need to be optimized
22:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> sockets
22:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> eh
22:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the 128 player limit
22:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> bring some perf things to surface
23:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Physics are the slowest probably
23:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks
23:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1111400150129180732/svwxfiyidz1b1.webp
23:13 < bridge> <Learath2> Our collision code is O(n^2), lot's of optimization to be had there
23:37 < bridge> <deen> Haskell is too high level for you to worry about stack 😄
23:37 < bridge> <deen> Yes, you make functions tail recursive to optimize them
23:38 < bridge> <deen> no stack overflows, but you can get problems with lazy evaluation and unevaluated trees of thunks, even when the result would be a simple integer you can have multi-GB memory lying around unevaluated
23:49 < bridge> <Voxel> i want to look at collision code to see what could be done (no promises that i will do anything but if i do then i will be loved for it ^^)
23:50 < bridge> <Learath2> There is nothing trivial there though and whatever you do needs to not change physics at all, so it's not a very beginner friendly place to dig around in
