00:05 < fokkonaut> ChillerDragon:
00:05 < fokkonaut> i need you on wire
00:13 < bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Please, its important
01:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Scrumplex if you want to test ^
01:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in theory this should work without xwayland i guess(atleast the startup etc.).
01:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> If it crashes at runtime it might be some X11 code we call ðŸ˜„
03:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> just happened to get up ðŸ¥³
04:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @Jupstar âœª which kog server were you in. i didn't have jetpack prediction on kog
04:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~or i'm not getting how kog works~~
04:05 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it does it on any
04:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> then that tuning fix probably fixed that too somehow.
04:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i merged that fix
04:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont get the projectile anymore
04:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but still the kog thing
04:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe undefined behavior somewhere? ðŸ˜„
04:06 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't have it on my end it seems
04:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ðŸ¤”
04:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't know how to run UBSAN for client yet.
04:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> since i'm on windows
04:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
04:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/837873059733176351/2021-05-01_04-08-02.mkv
04:08 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i'll check
04:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~at least remux it~~
04:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sadly ubsan doesnt detect non initialized stuff, gonna try with valgrind
04:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> me joining kogs be like `26/902 KiB (9.0 KiB/s)`
04:10 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ouch, guess kog should upload its map to the https map pool ðŸ˜„
04:15 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> also i don't get why do we have m_Tuning[2] in CWorldCore AND CGameWorld AND CGameClient
04:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs dummy?
04:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i get the [2] part
04:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't get why do we need 3 copies of the same thing
04:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah ok xd
04:16 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> and not copying them all the time it seems
04:17 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nope no undefined behavior, you sure u have antiping on?
04:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm sure
04:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> otherwise i would notice since i'm on like 200 ping
04:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i tried on kog chile but also get it there
04:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> +200 ping there
04:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'll try on chile
04:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do you use MSVC? maybe its a compiler thing?`xd
04:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> bruh
04:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but ye, i do use msvc
04:19 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> let me try on my mac
04:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its probably unlikely tho that its a compiler thing ðŸ˜„
04:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> if pnglite/version didn't f me up
04:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe we have a different config somewhere
04:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> does kog use ddnetcharacter?
04:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i've no idea, kog uses ddnet 9.x
04:21 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 9.3.1
04:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i think i got it
04:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> there are more dangling tuning stuff lying around in character.
04:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> emmm
04:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i got timedout in kog because i paused my process, and i reconnected in the middle of the map
04:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> fixes it
04:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :justatest:
04:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> weird
04:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that these values ever existed, yes xd
04:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> well getting rid of redundant data is probably good whether there is a bug or not i guess.
04:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> "// if ddnetcharacter is available, ignore server-wide tunings for hook and collision"
04:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do serverwide tunes not get altered by this?
04:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i don't know what that does too
04:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe some check in predicted char is weird
04:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Also i feel like we should just get rid of m_Tuning everywhere. Uses tune zone and tune zone 0 for everything.
04:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the commit for it fixed 2 issues:
04:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3276
04:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd say, discuss that with @nuborn
04:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'm not doing it tho
04:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I don't want to break more things kek
04:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD
04:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ddnet code in a nutshell i'd say
04:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u move 1 line of code... u have a new game
04:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~and the only reason i'm fixing tune zone visuals for projectiles is pvp servers can use that~~
04:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> worth it
04:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i guess we can have maps with smaller tune zones too
04:54 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/837884653502464000/2021-05-01_10-53-57.mp4
05:20 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wtf xd
05:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but i guess the one of the reason of us needing tunezone locally now is that we get rid of velocity data in ddnetprojectiles
05:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> we got rid of*
05:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> that reminded me that I should test infclass with master branch probably
05:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gamer client features, best xd
05:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/837895875757735946/screenshot_2021-05-01_05-36-12.png
05:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> why tho
05:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in gamer client u could use ^p to have purple, or ^b to have blue
05:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its oldschool client which all pvp players used before ddnet
05:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i know. but why tho.:kek:
05:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nostalgia
05:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just like quake sounds
05:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there is one person in my clan with that oldschool letters:
05:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://ddnet.tw/players/-94-b-91-Bro-93--32-flummi/
05:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
05:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he requested it ðŸ˜„
05:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> worth it
05:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 100% xdddd
05:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> infc seems fine
05:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> hmm
06:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> reminds me of bbcode
08:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just tested wayland for the GLES pr, big oof
08:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> KDE really needs to improve it ðŸ˜„
08:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland works ðŸ˜„
10:56 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> is swap not broken now?
11:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I think it's been fixed already
11:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3764
18:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Deeper> https://youtu.be/--6hAxfJxbM
18:28 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Deeper> Can someone explain how it works?
18:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Deeper> Why do I jump higher when I move?
18:31 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> interesting ðŸ˜®
18:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe your timing isn't exactly correct?
18:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Deeper> I jumped for 20 minutesand never died
18:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, very odd
18:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Deeper> but when i moved after double i died
18:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Deeper> but when i moved after double i immediately died
18:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe some floating point inaccuracy when we have velocity vectors that are not parallel to any axis
18:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> time to rank getspeed3 in 5 seconds with this :monkaLaugh:

18:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> :justatest:
18:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Deeper can I have the map you tested on?
18:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Deeper> ha
18:43 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Deeper> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/838093375256133733/down.map
18:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> did it work
19:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Deeper> This works everywhere, I noticed it half a year ago with Rapture when we did map with deathtiles
19:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Deeper> This works everywhere, I noticed it half a year ago with Rapture when we did map with deadtiles
19:51 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> kill tiles have bigger hitbox
19:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> sadly
20:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> another weird bug
20:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i know that start & end tile have different hit boxes depending on what tiles you're on
20:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, that one is known I think
20:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> e.g. freeze tile next to end tile allows you to end even if you're not in the end tile
20:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yep
20:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <FightSpirit> This might seem like a stupid question; But how is the privacy policy if i get the game with DDR Original client, instead of steam? Does it collect data in the background?
20:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <FightSpirit> Im not sure if even steam does it xD But you never know
20:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you dont need any account to play ddnet, the only thing that ddnet may have is your ip for (3 days i think?) and thats it
20:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all data is public besides that
20:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> your ranks are public
20:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but u dont even own ur name given anyone can use it
20:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using steam is less privacy aware than the original client
20:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw
20:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <NeXus> DDnet sells your personal data to russian hackers
20:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <FightSpirit> Ah thanks for the fast reply ðŸ™‚ I was more thinking in terms if the client had built in things that would track and collect data on what i do on the computer
20:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <FightSpirit> But i suppose not from your reply xD Also i didnt think DDR would do it since its ad free etc, but still wanted to make sure
21:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet is completly open source
21:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can view the code
21:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and compile it urself
21:09 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
21:24 < bridge_> [ddnet] <FightSpirit> Im too n00b for that atm ðŸ˜… Maybe next year when i my coding skills are better. Also yeah, it being open sounce makes me love the project even more
