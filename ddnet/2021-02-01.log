00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen I got it to build with the bundled MySQL libs, but it crashes on startup for me (as with mysqlcppconn). could I just drop these libraries, requiring users to use the system libraries for this?
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> eh, can't believe the C libs are also broken
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but system libs in Debian 10 are also broken for example
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> system C libs?
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no, mysqlcppconn
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> C lib directly I haven't tried
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> is the rich presence image not transparent?
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks transparent to me, when clicking on louis
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah I guess the guy above's screenshot is messed up
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> apparently images for discord need to be dilated as well xD
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, found the bug 🙂
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> quickly testing and then I'll send the PR
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Great 🙂
03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think teams are broken in 15.3-rc1 server for old clients, "louis" joined a team but it doesnt show in scoreboard anymore

03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @deen
03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how it should look

03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> just ban old clients
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no u
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> noby cant update cuz his bot won't work
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Nobo u ping at 3am
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> noby never sleeps so he thinks its normal
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it was 8pm
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @noby what old version? I tried 14.7 and it works with the most recent fix by heinrich5991. (not yet part of RC1)
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 10.6.2
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> works too, so problem is fixed by heinrich's fix
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> :D
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> real news
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @noby what hour is it there now

11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is it true that in the c++ std they don't improve existing primitives, such as vector or unordered_map with better implementations due to breaking the ABI?
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/abi/

11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The simple fact that we had this conversation and voted not to break ABI tends to show that the ecosystem is ossifying and ossifying fast. Each passing day makes the problem a bit worse and more expensive.
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not only ABI, but also that the standard effectively mandated a single type of hashmap
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because of the guarantees around how long iterators and pointers stay valid
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich5991: wait for code style pls
12:08 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon troll pr
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> u
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> i am curious if it fails on postgres
12:09 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon:test-ci-postgres
12:09 <+Ryozuki> what postgres
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux/runs/1806006209
12:10 <+Ryozuki> it failed
12:10 <+ChillerDragon> yea why tho
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you checked the log? ^^
12:11 <+Ryozuki> E: The repository 'https://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt focal-pgdg Release' no longer has a Release file.
12:11 <+Ryozuki> Error: Process completed with exit code 100.
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> i use same github actions
12:11 <+Ryozuki> why u have to pr to check ci?
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> so thats weird
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: try rerunning your CI
12:11 <+ChillerDragon> i did
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe it was an intermittent failure
12:13 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: if ddnet would fail too what i expected it would be a ddnet issue
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> test
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 ur pr works for me
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> #3583
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3583
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice 🙂
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> should i bors it?
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Learath2 added a concern I should address before merging
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let me do that
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> yikes time to stop merging with ddnet upstream
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> discord in ddnet client :/
12:15 <+Ryozuki> well then ill just leave a comment
12:15 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon nobo u have to opt in
12:15 <+Ryozuki> when compiling
12:15 <+Ryozuki> its off by default
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> i red DDISCORD_DYNAMIC=ON
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> hm ok still off
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> i see
12:16 <+Ryozuki> DDISCORD=ON
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> does it phone home?
12:16 <+Ryozuki> u need this for discord support
12:16 <+Ryozuki> dude
12:16 <+Ryozuki> it only sets ur activity with more info on discord
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> did u wireshark it?
12:16 <+Ryozuki> https://cdn.noby.world/1612178205.png
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> id prefer my ddnet client not having features that spy on me
12:17 <+Ryozuki> then dont enable it
12:17 <+Ryozuki> i doubt  the sdk would do anything if u dont have discord on anyway
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> one should test that
12:17 <+Ryozuki> no
12:17 <+Ryozuki> u simply compile it without discord
12:18 <+ChillerDragon> i guess if it stays off by default and there is no discord code run or linked when off its fine
12:21 <+ChillerDragon> ok nice running the ci a 3rd time seemed to fix it
12:21 <+Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 ci is failing 
12:21 <+ChillerDragon> sorry for bothering u 
12:22 <+Ryozuki> even on ur pr
12:22 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3583/checks?check_run_id=1806116834
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> oh nvm
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> it seems to be a isse
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> :D
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> yea thats what i wanted to point out Ryozuki seems to be kinda random
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks like the same intermittent failure as ChillerDragon has experienced
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> ye
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> probably some trouble on github side im sure it will fix it self over time
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> thought they change something with the postgres packet
12:24 <+Ryozuki> why is postgres involved in this
12:24 <+Ryozuki> where do we use postgres?
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we don't, it's some apt repository configured on github ci
12:37 <+Ryozuki> i just read the 15.3 changelog, quite long
12:37 <+Ryozuki> :O
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Ryozuki: I addressed Learath2's concern, I think it should be fine to merge now
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> should i retest it?
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/4f551c3cb7a6e7c79014af827ab8c64c38668e91..211b1d9155719a9214a1c9b9bc20dc93ae792db9 no, it should be fine
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (famous last words) but I only modified the build system, not the code
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     DISCORD_DYNAMIC

12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah wait
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt checkout the pr
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> github cli failing me
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/805764901024694322/unknown.png
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> git fetch ddnet_upstream pull/3583/head
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i deleted the branch
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> works
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess its fine to merge now
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is something I really despise about how the these things were written. There are certain guarantees given in the standard that locks you into certain implementations
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But the brightside is the worst offender is unordered map and that's the hardest to get a good generic version of anyway so it's usually beneficial to use a specialized implementation anyway
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> most languages manage to ship a usable hashmap
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> python, go, rust
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, usable is maybe the wrong word, not hamstrung by the standard to be less efficient than possible
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The C++ one is also 'usable' for some definition of usable
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, see my second message
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk about any similar issue with vector tho, so idk what you are talking about there @Ryozuki
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > A hash map implemented with quadratic probing and SIMD lookup.
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sounds so pro
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah no it was just examples
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if they can be optimized or not
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the question is they wont even if its possible
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With the C++ standard your only choice is open hashing with chaining
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> those are the ABI concerns mentioned above
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you basically can't change the vector implementation in a C++ stdlib without changing the ABI, so it's not done
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rust doesn't give that ABI stability
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ABI versioning should have been a thing in C++
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/805768271797289020/unknown.png
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's such a boneheaded move to think that the ABI will never have to change
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should be able to have all three as long as you don't define ABI Stability so strictly
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > By not breaking ABI, the committee is clearly stating that they will support your ill-formed program forever.
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The estimated performance loss due to our unwillingness to break ABI is estimated to be 5-10%
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is all in the blog post i sent
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually interesting
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Many game developers are notoriously skeptical of the standard library, they developed alternatives, for example, EASTL. Facebook has folly, Google has Abseil, etc.
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://abseil.io/
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah many people have their own stls that break some of these guarantees
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Folly has folly::string with copy on write and a massive small buffer optimization abusing the behaviour of their allocator
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Cow
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🐮
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how does your discord dynamic patch work btw?
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd have thought you'd need function pointers for every gamesdk function
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes 🙂
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that's only `DiscordCreate` 😄
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh we only call one? :D
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the rest is funciton pointers returned in some other way
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the discord SDK only has a single public function
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is very convenient
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's just begging to be dynamically loaded actually. Maybe we should just do that everywhere?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd prefer not to, complicates things
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't even know how to do it on windows, macos
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> macos probably same as linux though
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though mac and windows have excellent forwards and backwards compat with their system libs so doesnt really matter there
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 well windows supports dlopen with their POSIX layer but if you don't like that there is always LoadLibraryA :P
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't look like it has dlopen, but LoadLibrary looks fairly similar
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I'm thinking about the cygwin implementation, sorry
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fopen-wfopen?view=msvc-160 does `_wfopen` allow you to use almost-UTF-16 for filenames?
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I should add that to ddnet so we can actual treat "special" (non-ascii) characters correctly on windows
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think so(tm). We already have utf16 encoding in system.c so shouldnt be hard to use
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should be calling CreateFileW under the hood anyway
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doing a simple refactor which leads you to remove hundreds of line feels good
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i should have done it this way before
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good thing about programming langs that use ; at end of each statement is that in vim u can delete until ; easily with `dt;`
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vim masterace
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://streamable.com/l38gxb 👀
16:31 <+ChillerDragon> if its proper code with one statement a line dd is faster
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> whats the diff between dt; and df; ?
16:32 <+ChillerDragon> i mean f to find a letter makes sense to me idk what t does
16:36 <+Ryozuki> t means till which means until
16:36 <+Ryozuki> yeah but i dont want to delete the whole line
16:36 <+Ryozuki> loko the vid
16:36 <+Ryozuki> look*
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> in the video you delete until the end of line, so `D` does basically the same, if you don't bother rewriting the `;` and if you don't have a comment behind the line
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> ye
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> would also use D there
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> but thats just taste
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont delete til end of line
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i delete til ;
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rewriting the ; involves goign to insert mode
17:08 <+ChillerDragon> ye we get it :D
17:08 <+ChillerDragon> vim masterrace i can only agree
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> In a programming language without ; you don't need the ;
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> 🤔
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @Ryozuki Are you doing web development with rust?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @NeXus yes
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my whole web is made in rust
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://edgarluque.com/
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Hows the experience?
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Is it any good
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it may look only static to u but it has a whole backend
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like it
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @NeXus its not like django which gives u in a silver plate
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess rn its more like flask
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or express
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but on steroids
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since its as fast as the top c++ web framework
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dragon or smth
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it competes in speed with https://github.com/an-tao/drogon
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use https://actix.rs/
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @NeXus it is strongly typed af
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Are there libraries?
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wdym
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actix.rs is a library
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I mean something like a package manager
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah u never used rust
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> no
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust has cargo, which is the package manager that comes with it
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://crates.io/
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the package registry
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://rustup.rs/
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to install rust
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and try it
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has a steep learning curve
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its rly nice
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Sounds nice, I always like better performance and typed languages
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Big downside to js
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Might look into it
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Frontend part might be limited tho right? Or are you able to manipulate DOM elements in real time
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> frontend
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it depends on how u aproach it
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt want to use reactjs for my web so idk how it would work
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use askama for tempaltes
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> templates
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my website is also not js dependent
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont need much js code
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/djc/askama
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with askama u can know at compile time if ur template is correct
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is also a rust project that is like reactjs and uses wasm
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://yew.rs
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have yet to use it
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but looks promising
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @NeXus with this i think u can avoid js completly
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and use only the best language: rust

23:04 <+ChillerDragon> depends on the work i guess

23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "We care about your privacy"
23:09 <+ChillerDragon> yea fucking banners 
23:09 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon im gaining stars on github https://cdn.noby.world/1612217333.png  famous soon
23:09 <+ChillerDragon> everytime i see somthing like that
23:09 <+ChillerDragon> i close the site
23:09 <+ChillerDragon> nice
23:09 <+ChillerDragon> its funny how rust uses -rs
23:09 <+ChillerDragon> but haskells -hs is funnier in german
23:09 <+Ryozuki> i used -rs cuz paypal itself was used
23:10 <+Ryozuki> its also common to buy a .rs domain
23:10 <+Ryozuki> for ur project
23:10 <+Ryozuki> diesel.rs
23:10 <+Ryozuki> amethyst.rs
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> no ssl monka
23:11 <+Ryozuki> who
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> diesel
23:11 <+ChillerDragon> ye who
23:11 <+ChillerDragon> lul
23:11 <+Ryozuki> it has  ssl
23:11 <+Ryozuki> use firefox
23:11 <+Ryozuki> the best browser
23:11 <+ChillerDragon> i do
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> it has no redirection
23:11 <+Ryozuki> https://diesel.rs/
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> rs is quite expensive
23:11 <+ChillerDragon> hm ye
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at least at my registrar
23:11 <+ChillerDragon> it didnt redirect me either Ryozuki 
23:11 <+Ryozuki> nobos
23:11 <+ChillerDragon> i blame the site
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> http://diesel.rs/
23:11 <+ChillerDragon> u have some https everywhere addon bloat plugin Ryozuki 
23:11 <+Ryozuki> it redirects me
23:12 <+Ryozuki> ah
23:12 <+Ryozuki> firefox probs does it
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> fucking brave user
23:12 <+Ryozuki> itself
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> i use firefox
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> !!
23:12 <+Ryozuki> i use firefox dev edition
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> oh sir
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> so dev
23:12 <+Ryozuki> i guess it redirects me to https cuz firefox knows it exists
23:12 <+Ryozuki> since i visited it before
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> ah ye
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> doesnt do it for me tho xd
23:13 <+Ryozuki> visit https
23:13 <+Ryozuki> then try http
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://hstspreload.org/?domain=diesel.rs says that there's no HSTS header
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps you have https everywhere? (good addon)
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I also have it, and I'm automatically redirected to https
23:14 <+Ryozuki> https://cdn.noby.world/1612217664.png
23:14 <+Ryozuki> maybe duckduck go does it
23:14 <+Ryozuki> https://cdn.noby.world/1612217681.png
23:14 <+Ryozuki> or this
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's probably sufficient to use ublock to replace duckduckgo privacy essentials and privacy badger
23:15 <+Ryozuki> i use the 3
23:15 <+Ryozuki> and no its not enough
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you elaborate why?
23:16 <+Ryozuki> i know this cuz some webs failed with privacy badger on, cuz they broke without their tracker
23:16 <+Ryozuki> and i had everything else on
23:16 <+Ryozuki> xd
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ublock does some stuff to not break websites, so it's not a sure sign
23:17 <+Ryozuki> https://privacybadger.org/#What-is-Privacy-Badger
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. it inserts a fake google analytics thing
23:18 <+Ryozuki> duckduck go only blocks 4 trackers on twitch
23:18 <+Ryozuki> privacy badger 7
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> these numbers are made up, and being a better blocker can give you lower numbers
23:19 <+Ryozuki> they are not made up
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. by not loading the third party domain that only loads 5 more ads
23:19 <+Ryozuki> since u can see the list
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> less blocking would lead to better numbers there
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/About-%22This-other-extension-reports-more-stuff-blocked!%22
23:27 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1612218392.png
23:27 <+ChillerDragon> why do i have the feeling i will never know who it was
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://skins.ddnet.tw/ looks weird rn
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://ddnet.tw/skins/ @Patiga ^
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> huh
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess your page could redirect to the real one
23:58 <+ChillerDragon> if my device has two drives can i simple mount one drive and use it as a normal directory?
