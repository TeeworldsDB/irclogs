01:23 < bridge> <louis> why number man
02:11 < bridge> <pathos3005> @chillerdragon would it be possible to get players names at `ddnet-insta` server `restart; record`?
02:25 < bridge> <louis> what maps even use delay?
07:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @pathos3005: I don’t understand your question could you rephrase?
07:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Get player names where what which record
07:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @louis.place: archimedes
07:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
07:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @ryozuki: great day to close 10 prs
08:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 i got pranked real good by your macro refactor. I thought im 200iq adding my net msgs at the top in my forks. And you went and edited the top of the file!!!
08:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/71bd1661907d829b8eb31baacbf994a85ccb35f2/src/engine/shared/protocol_ex_msgs.h#L25
08:13 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** conflicted my ass in a bazillion forks.
08:14 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** Since this protocol is designed to be fork friendly because ids dont conflict can we get a git conflict marker comment here too like in config variables? I would open a pr but if i open it it gets rejected xd
09:02 < bridge> <Assa> not many, but mine does i believe
09:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @MilkeeyCat sos i got broken neovim how to fix!!! When i press tab or new line in this file it uses the wrong indent and i have no idea why https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta/blob/41a44bc5c55680919c3d142d78f663e743b93e68/src/game/server/instagib/gamecontext.cpp#L593
09:18 < bridge> <milkeeycat> try closing and opening again neovim xd
09:19 < bridge> <melon> ChillerDragon why is archimede the number man
09:20 < bridge> <stormaxd> gonna love clion llm
09:20 < bridge> <stormaxd> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1397840810300538962/image.png?ex=68833033&is=6881deb3&hm=171ccd399b7a9eefe6c00e08dd2725d55dc55d00a2234e08b22e8738dbe35961&
09:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @milkeeycat i even tried switching device
09:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @melon archimedes
09:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> works for me :p
09:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** wtf
09:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** can i buy ur neovim config?
09:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes
09:38 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @stormaxd totally fits the pattern xd
09:39 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** "free zombietoad" is nice one btw
09:39 < bridge> <stormaxd> for real
09:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: you can buy it for $0 https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/init.lua
09:45 < bridge> <Assa> How do you even use a feature like this, if it isn't explained and all other offsets in the game are in ms
09:45 < bridge> <Assa> gumo ^.^
10:07 < bridge> <Assa> you can't update the sounds in mapformat without breaking downwardscompat. I'd need to up the version, but doing this makes the client ignore sounds on map loading. If I don't do this I might load random data in newer clients with older maps
10:09 < bridge> <Assa> this version check doesn't exist for other mapdata
10:46 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @robyt3 i need editor tabs RIGHT NOW xd didnt u have that done already? i cant find the pr or even a branch on your gh
10:55 < bridge> <robyt3> It was only a quick hack for the demo video I posted. I had literally only hard-coded the tab button labels because the editor only had the filename globally. So far my branch only includes a lot of changes to support multiple maps by moving members to `CEditorMap`. I'll push my branch when I have a usable prototype.
11:05 < bridge> <melon> Roby implementing one of the biggest advantages of ddnet-rs's editor <a:pepefight:1106645584183570572>
11:05 < bridge> <Assa> He is just inspired by greatness, like I was for rendering
11:06 < bridge> <melon> :poggers2:
11:06 < bridge> <melon> Next step: implement multiplayer editing :cat_cracked_hehe:
11:52 < bridge> <Assa> how do I get the default tuning value of a tune?
11:52 < bridge> <Assa> how do I get the default tuning value of a tune in client??
11:53 < bridge> <Assa> how do I get the default tuning value of a tune in client? Like `GameClient()->GetTuning( expects tune zone)`
11:54 < bridge> <Assa> guess hardcoding it is then
11:56 < bridge> <teero777> what no
11:56 < bridge> <teero777> i mean kinda
12:06 < bridge> <robyt3> You can get the default tuning value by creating a temporary `CTuningParams Default;` object, which has the default tunings per default.
12:06 < bridge> <Assa> Yes, but thinking about it, even if we'd change the default value of this parameter, it should not affect the rendering of other laser types
12:07 < bridge> <Assa> Yes, but thinking about it, even if we'd change the default value of this parameter, it should not affect the rendering of other laser types. It should also not be a new option or something
12:08 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems better than hard-coding the `150`
12:10 < bridge> <Assa> while I agree, the rendering of lasers is full of magic values anyways, an idiot must have written it (it was me)
12:10 < bridge> <robyt3> There should just be a constant with the default tuning somewhere in the gameclient or gamecore
12:10 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't make sense that we create the default tuning every time we need it
12:11 < bridge> <robyt3> There should just be a constant with the default tuning somewhere in the gameclient/gameserver or gamecore
12:11 < bridge> <Assa> We could add a GetDefaultTuning function with a static CTuningParams Default;
12:12 < bridge> <Assa> would there speak anything against it? I think a singleton in this case wouldn't hurt
12:13 < bridge> <robyt3> True, could add `CTuningParams::DEFAULT` directly
13:40 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: do you have dap set up in your neovim?
14:17 < bridge> <pathos3005> Ah sorry -- so I'm trying to get the players' names into YouTube's vid titles from the demo/video. Just wondering if `ddnet-insta` server saves stats at the end of the match in the `.csv` file like these auto screenshots + auto csv files.
14:17 < bridge> <pathos3005> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1397915598142443673/image.png?ex=688375da&is=6882245a&hm=e99bed85e7e1338c3b392dda20835c9c52a8ab1181d180ca53e7bd709e66cb31&
14:17 < bridge> <pathos3005> @chillerdragon but it could also be like console output
14:18 < bridge> <teero777> vscode is more comfortable for that imo
14:18 < bridge> <teero777> i couldn't figure out dap
14:18 < bridge> <teero777> i dont have any keybinds left
14:18 < bridge> <teero777> i dont have any keybinds left to assign
14:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> don't even have it installed
14:19 < bridge> <teero777> its my git client
14:19 < bridge> <teero777> commandline can be a hassle
14:19 < bridge> <teero777> git cli can be a hassle
15:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What is a dap. I don’t configure anything. It’s managed for me
15:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes round end stats can be posted as csv or json to file or http endpoint it includes player names
15:41 < bridge> <learath2> I have used git cli for so long the guis now really feel so incapable to me. Maybe it's just my workflow that is not very common
15:42 < bridge> <learath2> I use resets and rebases (especially interactive ones) all the time, I also regularly push a local branch to a different remote branch
15:43 < bridge> <robyt3> GUI is only useful to stage individual lines
15:46 < bridge> <learath2> I do that with git add -i when needed. But yes gui makes it much more pleasant
15:47 < bridge> <robyt3> But this only allows staging individual hunks, not lines?
15:48 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, yes, if the hunks don't align properly for you it's even more annoying
15:49 < bridge> <learath2> You can edit the hunk yourself to only get what you want when splitting doesnt split enough
15:51 < bridge> <melon> Everytime I use an integrated git tool something messes up :justatest:
15:51 < bridge> <robyt3> I usually do various refactorings and then add them to different commits, having to split a lot of hunks manually would probably take too long. This works as long as the same line isn't changed in multiple commits.
15:51 < bridge> <melon> roby are you using sublimes git thingie?
15:51 < bridge> <melon> Sublime merge or whatever it's called
15:51 < bridge> <robyt3> I use "Git for Windows" GUI, but I also switched to VS Code
15:52 < bridge> <robyt3> I use "Git for Windows" GUI, but I also switched to VS Code from Sublime
15:52 < bridge> <melon> Aww :(
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😮
15:55 < bridge> <learath2> I do like merge helpers though
15:56 < bridge> <learath2> Probably the only feature of the git integration I used back when I was on vscode
15:56 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, that's pretty useful
16:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what are merge helpers ._.
16:05 < bridge> <robyt3> The show a UI around the `<<<< === >>>>` block, or show the diff side-by-side
16:11 < bridge> <avolicious> Have you tried Zed?
16:11 < bridge> <avolicious> I recommend
16:42 < bridge> <pathos3005> One quick last question -- what about before/after of rank or ELO or points etc.? So let's say 'red team wins' or 'player X wins' shows up, and the server just shows output of the command `/rank X` or something along those lines
17:00 < bridge> <Assa> can a maintainer merge https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10539 by roby? Like it's double approved and not complicated
17:15 < bridge> <melon> Oh yeah zed is great with this
17:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> zed is the best
17:24 < bridge> <kollpotato> it has voice chat support
17:25 < bridge> <melon> :justatest: 
17:25 < bridge> <melon> 
17:25 < bridge> <melon> "Hey zed team, fix my code"
17:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah and you can share your code obviously
17:25 < bridge> <kollpotato> nothing bad will happen
17:26 < bridge> <melon> It rather looks like Heinrich forgot to add it to queue :nouis:
17:26 < bridge> <melon> When Heinrich adds a "thanks" he usually adds it to queue right after
17:27 < bridge> <Assa> is a PR, which is approved by a maintainer, but not merged (and doesn't have merge conflicts) always forgot to automerge?
17:27 < bridge> <Assa> is a PR, which is approved by a maintainer, but not merged (and doesn't have merge conflicts) always forgotten to automerge?
17:27 < bridge> <Assa> Except when maintainer writes "can sb else take a second look" or something ofc
17:28 < bridge> <melon> Depends, some maintainers may approve but not merge `just yet` to get another ones opinion
18:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @pathos3005 shows where? you mean in chat? No thats not happening yet but there is a issue for it https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta/issues/376
18:16 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but in the round end stats that get sent to file or http endpoint you can see the winner because it also includes the score
18:47 < bridge> <learath2> I thought heinrich merged it when he sent the Thanks 😛
18:57 < bridge> <Assa> Thanks! ||Proceeds to not merge||
20:03 < bridge> <always> if i add #9465 into my own client and use it would that be considered cheating?
20:03 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9465
20:08 < bridge> <robyt3> Yes, see https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9821#pullrequestreview-2687733822
20:09 < bridge> <louis> if you want that feature you can open an issue and get some ppl to agree with you
20:09 < bridge> <louis> i think its a good qol change probably needs a better implementation though
20:10 < bridge> <always> i think the current implemontation was good
20:14 < bridge> <louis> yeah, if the maintainers agree it can be added i'd put some better visual feedback tho
20:16 < bridge> <always> i remember when i first started and i tried the 45 degree bind i messed up my game and i couldnt move my mouse
20:17 < bridge> <chairn> can we not add more automation into the game ?
20:17 < bridge> <always> it isnt really automation
20:18 < bridge> <chairn> it is ?
20:18 < bridge> <louis> It replicates a bind that's been in the game for a long time
20:18 < bridge> <louis> only difference is it snaps your mouse to the equivalent direction instead of on your tee
20:39 < bridge> <Assa> @learath2 may I get you to take a look at #10501 and #10527? They are blocking my rendering evil master Arc

20:40 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** pst
20:41 < bridge> <melon> there isnt a thing like zcatch in 2025
20:41 < bridge> <learath2> Honestly, jupstar should probably be the one to review these. I can take a look

21:41 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** and the spec thing already happens????
21:42 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @Assa the ddnet client has a """feature""" where you can click to unfollow which in zcatch behaves more like a bug 
21:43 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** #9733 there is nothing i can do server side
21:43 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9733
21:47 < bridge> <Assa> idk I guess I did this a few times frameperfectly
21:47 < bridge> <Assa> oh camp protection is missing
21:47 < bridge> <Assa> like you can catch a player, and then hide on the map forever in a corner for 20 minutes
21:47 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yes its common because you try to shoot when you die
21:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** i turned camp protection off because i dont like it
21:48 < bridge> <Assa> doesn't need to be very strickt
21:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** tbh i also dont like spray and spam prot but i can survive and there is so much demand for it
21:48 < bridge> <Assa> just present
21:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** why tho
21:48 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** camping is cool

22:29 < bridge> <melon> Yeah idk chiller.
22:35 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wait it’s a complicated bug or what?
22:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds free to me. I mean we figured it out in one second that it’s offset issue because of Hi! And it was caused by the 2 character offset shift from the bold name update
22:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But discord names aren’t bold only webchat ones so gotta do some if statement maybe
23:23 < bridge> <pathos3005> Yes exactly that! I think I saw it in some FNG server, and if there is some cleaner way of presenting than that, that would be amazing
23:24 < bridge> <pathos3005> @chillerdragon FNG one is indeed spammy -- insanely long
