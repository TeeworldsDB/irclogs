00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice, finally i can see how good newer hardware compares to mine ðŸ˜„
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> interesting results already,
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> rtx 2080 ti beats my gpu by factor 2
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there is also an AMD laptop benchmark:
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://openbenchmarking.org/result/2102211-PTS-XONOTICD79
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Opengl 3.3 is slightly slower than 3.0 there
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> For me its the opposite:
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://openbenchmarking.org/result/2103154-HA-JVEGA64RY23,2103152-HA-JVEGA64RY92
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would love to see GTX 1080 TI(bcs my GPU was released as a competitor against that)
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and ofc i'd love too see the current top high end cards ðŸ˜„
06:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> @fokkonaut the values only changed to me after trying to do anything with dummy, like changing skin and other things
06:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> then entire config gets messed up
07:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks, will look into it
07:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> @fokkonaut does the bug occur to you too?
07:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I'll be on my pc soon
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I hope so
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then I could fix it
07:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And I can imagine it happening with dummy skin, I had a bug there before, fixed it, and if its broken after a big master update again that would make sense
08:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Thanks that you responded, it does.
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> does it like randomize the skin or something?
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> when you are trying to change one skin part
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, im trying to find the issue right now
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i remember that they added a skin randomizer recently to vanilla and maybe that could cause it
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nop
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hm, cant find the issue that quickly
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> need to do something else first. will look into it later again..
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> wow such low fps
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> i get 1500 on my rx580 lmfao
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> at that specific benchmark? its pretty GPU intensive
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> ah
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> why even becnhmark teeworlds tho...
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> like
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> who tf needs more than 240fps
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cant play with 240 fps xD
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> me
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also its not so much about fps, but also about frame times, which make the game feel very smooth
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> I know
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> but like let me guess most of the people here dont have more than 144hz
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, but if you dont play with gsync or freesync, then you should have more FPS than ur monitor can output
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> 1600fps and 0.5ms  frame times that is what I have
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> i mean sure but 1500 fps and 500 dont make a difference lmfao
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd say > 1000 its pretty stable xd
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> i will cap my fps and see the difference
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> bet its not even noticable
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> also unless you play on a 2004 xp machine you will get more than 200fps
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i notice < 1000 fps
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u have a 144hz
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> nah but I know how this works
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> i play on 60hz
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also the sense of benchmarking is more, too compare hardware ðŸ˜„
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with entities and without health HUD, i get 10000fps
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:

10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> teeworlds isnt really the best game to compare hardware lol
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> depends
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> bruh
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> no
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in the end usage is usage, just bcs u might not use specific pipeline features, doesnt mean it doesnt mean anything
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> my benchmark wouldnt be fricking teeworlds lmfao
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> many cpu benchmarks also just test a single thing
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> sure id do it for fun but for actual results nah
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> openbenchmark is a collection of different benchmarks
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so it makes sense imo
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> sure ig, just not worth it if you wanna get actual results on how your pc performs
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> again, depends on what u do on ur cpu
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its like u say ARM sucks, because x86 has stronger floating point calculations
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but youtube doesnt care about floating point performance
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> dude
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> im just saying
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> benchmarking teeworlds for actual results
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> is not really efficient
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> id benchmark something else
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and i say its part of a collection of benchmarks
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> which then makes sense
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> and i said this
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u have a GPU that rules everything but sucks in teeworlds, it still shows there is smth wrong
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> does such gpu even exist lol
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/821060495301673041/screenshot-20210315174106.png
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why does rtx 2080 super have so bad fps?=
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it could be a bug in the driver, or smth similar
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> just the driver, its more than obvious id say
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so it was useful it was tested
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> lmfao
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> i suppose so but still, there would be something way more convinient than checking/doing teeworlds benchmarks
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well then think what u want
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> lol
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> its true
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> give me a mathematical proof and i believe u
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> what do you mean, what equation should I do xD
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that teeworlds benchmark is not useful
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> proof that fact based
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> 1. teeworld is so unpopular no one would even check that first
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> 2. you could do any other opengl benchmark to check for drivers issues
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> I am not saying you should not do the benchmarks, you can, I couldn't care less
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> if you do it just to collect more info into a database and compare then that's on you
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> I am saying in reality it won't be really applicable universally
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> unless you want to check for specific issues with the game
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i still disagree, i'm ok with you calling it more unefficient then doing other designed benchmarks, but in the end its just an addition, it doesnt need to be used, but it can
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> Then you agree with me that is exactly what I said
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> it's just an addition you can do it
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> .
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> .
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> that
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> It's cool, as I said it just won't be as good as other more popular efficient becnhmarks just like you said
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just as you could not use other benchmarks ðŸ˜‰
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> hm?
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as i said, it depends on what u want to know
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> and I said that too
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> .
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> like this
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> then the benchmark is useful
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its nice that u said that, i said that from the beginning, when you said it is not useful
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this convo feels worthelss
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> less
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> no conversation is worthless, it might be pointless but not worthless
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well yea
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pointless then
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but isnt something pointless also worthless?
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> no lol
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> worthless adj    (without value)
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pointless adj    (without use, goal)
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> working 100 hours for a dollar is pointless but not worthless
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> because the dollar is worth something
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> your dignity and 100 hours ;D
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 are u here
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> can you quote it? I mightve missed it
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> read from here
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i insert the size of the vector beforehand
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and when unpacking i get it first
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it wrong?
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or what do u mean
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> I said no as in it is a useless benchmark outside of super specific areas, as a general benchmark it is useless
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> "useless"
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dont lie, i said "depends" u said "bruh no"
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> I am not lying
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> also getting a bit passively agressive, bud?
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this discussion is over, i stay to facts.
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> xD
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a max packet size, beyond that you need to chop it up
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i dont check that
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> Calm down man, no need to get pissed just because someone is saying something else different from your own opinion
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So for a proper VLA your pr looks too simple :D
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its fine as long as it stays within the max packet size right
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Aurix> and we both share the same facts -- you got what I said wrong
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 how could i check that?
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Um, the packer has a size method
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean maybe chopping is easy but what about the remaining data xd
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chopping is not trivial
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well if the object within has variables with non defined sizes yeah i guess
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even with defined sizes it's not that easy
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You need to modify the client to hold back incomplete chunks
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
11:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or you can maybe do template magic to generate a _MORE packet
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 are cnetmsgs put together in one big buffer or are they sent one by one
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are put together
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What we call messages are in CNetChunks which we pack together to get a CNetPacket
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If your chunk is larger than how large a packet can be - the header overhead, it'll never fit in a packet
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dunno what happens then :P
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean, we can make it so that a single netobjects never goes beyond x packet size
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and then if it cant fit in the current packet
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> put it at the start
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> of the next
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ez
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, but then how useful is this feature
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah not as useful
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I'm not sure. I'll let other people comment on it too
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to do something like this too to get rid of the chunking logic we have sprinkled around the code
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like votes, rcon commands, chat commands
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
11:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But I never figured out how to chunk it in a pretty way :P
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 sometimes gets good ideas for this protocol stuff
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª any idea about this? https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/4366772972649191150/?tscn=1615868366
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> game freezes totally, but gfx_opengl_major 1 didn't help
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Connection problems doesnâ€™t sound like a gfx issue, no?
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wasnt that the intel driver bug we talked for around half a year now xd
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd love to know of older clients work 100% without the crash while, the newer dont work with gfx_opengl_major 1
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs if so, it must be some patch between these versions.
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Else it could still be a windows update or smth similar
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i'm pretty sure the gl 1.x renderer itself didnt add any feature it didnt have before
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i only added the fallback code, but it only does stuff for >= gl 2.x 
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 1.x is the absolute basic, it disables everything and does nothing special
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe a SDL thing that only triggers on intel platforms, or GLEW loading something intels dont like or smth
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> would be easier to say if older clients actually dont have problems at all :/
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and i also dont even know if the newest intel driver now actually works
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah and also, the question is, if he restarted the client after entering the command
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u always have to assume the ppl do it exactly as you dont want them todo xd
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ddnet: Suggestion:ddnet:  new system messages  (see the image)
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 1 -hold "u" (show chat) for see it to not coverage the screen when you play
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 2-putting images for every effects like ,unhammer,endless  etc... until  the save if you have one
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/821386034204901396/sm.png
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like the idea of having status symbols for your current endless hook, etc. state ðŸ™‚
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we might even have an issue for that already
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ravie even drew icons
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ravie even had drawn icons
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't understand (1). do you mean we should remove system messages from the chat display when pressing u?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u is already binded to show chat
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> bound*
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i mean put system message above the chat no inside
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah. my first instinct tells me that I wouldn't like that, because those messages usually have an ordering related to chat messages
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. bye xyz, *** xyz has left the game
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> we alr have an issue for the icons
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> yes i say this  message like this leave it in chat
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe put server messages like ***you are in a solo part under the icoins in the top left
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, at that point you'd probably remove the solo part messages and only show the icons
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i said this too
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> m but new players might not know what the icons mean
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> for first 5 second
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also for ppl who dont want the icons u still need the messages
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> my plan is make division system message 3 parts
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 1-2-3
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> we can leave the old system message like old chat
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> go click f3
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> having 3 different sections on one side of the screen is messy
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and if the /top5 and /points stuff is changed then might as well make an actual UI for it rather than keep it in the ugly chat form
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> it's now in one side (in chat) i want fix the messy
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> you can do this too not nesscary do what i say Literally
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> place for top5,rank ...
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and place for left game...
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> and place for effect icons
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 actually, since various netmsgs are packed in a same packet we can do variable arrays in a different way tamimg that into account:for example if the player requests top x ranks via the protocol, make that netmsg have a response id, then the server sends x netmsg each having the info about 1 rank + the response id
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> + a way to know the total amount of ranks
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The ranks is an example to understand it easier
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Writing a wall of text on mobile sucks
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 actually, since various netmsgs are packed in a same packet we can do variable arrays in a different way taking that into account:for example if the player requests top x ranks via the protocol, make that netmsg have a response id, then the server sends x netmsg each having the info about 1 rank + the response id
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was thinking of abusing the chunking too. I'm not sure how to make either side pretty like that though
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ideally it shouldnt look any different to sending or receiving any single message
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> we can do both things putting icons and writing in chat (solo,unhammer...
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We so need an introduction for the UI
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Is it possible to translate system messages to another language?
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no. there's an issue about that
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3091
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @murpi can you explain what you need it for, right now?
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> oh ok
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/821400257929805884/pointsdisplaytest.png
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I've been playing alot on asia lately and I feel like people don't understund the system messages very well, like jetpack and such
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe doing `/points player` could bring up a display like that
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huh, I like it ðŸ˜„ @louis
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the only issue i see is that it wouldnt be serverwide anymore
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> with a new scoreboard we could show the points count of every player at all times
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> ðŸ’¯
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks for creating an issue ðŸ™‚
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I wanted to create a second scoreboard with ranks and such
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hence my pe abour VLA
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Pr
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to transmit that stuff out of the protocol tbf
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We'd need to add so many new messages and stuff. I wanted to just query `https://info.ddnet.tw/mapinfo?name=<ourname>` to get a json with all the relevant stuff
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this would make it main-ddnet-servers only feature, I wouldn't like that
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then someone else will have to do it. I don't have it in me to do yet another ad hoc implementation of chunking for both top5, points, leaderboard, regional leaderboard and whatever else we decide we want in the new scoreboard page
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> + it's just asking for something to go wrong, I'm okay with not being the one that wrote the scoreboard that broke ddnet by flooding connections or finally made the networking code not performant enough to push out all the chunks
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we had it with votes and rcon before, not sure how much more we can throttle, rcon completions already arrive at a snails pace
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah and a mapchange will definitely timeout everyone logged into rcon without throttling for this stuff
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh yeah why do rcon completions appear so slow
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Because the protocol is just not made for this kind of bulk information sending
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> all continents except europe start with a
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (or eurasia)
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and end with a too :p
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh well i guess north/south america technically starts with n/s
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Continent
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> m i was taught that north america and south america are 2 separate continents
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> according to wikipedia, there are anywhere between 7 and 4 continents ðŸ˜‰
18:27 <+Davide> @deen, why the heartbeats requests is in UDP and not TCP?
18:28 <+Davide> I am having trouble creating a reliable filter for the UDP packets due to the fact that I break heartbeat requests by doing so, would it be possible to use a different port for heartbeat or send it in TCP?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the heartbeats require the same UDP port that connecting players use
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you can't receive heartbeats, players can likely not connect to you
18:33 <+Davide> Yes they can.
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in what way do you distinguish between players and the heartbeats?
18:36 <+Davide> [2021-03-16 18:35:35][register]: WARNING: No master servers. Retrying in 60 seconds
18:36 <+Davide> IP: 45.141.57.5:27777
18:36 <+Davide> No heartbeats but I can join and play without problems
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what kind of filter do you use?
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why does it filter the heartbeat packets specifically?
18:37 <+Davide> Because apparently there are types of attacks that use the same traffic as heartbeats
18:37 <+Davide> I'm using my own filters + voxility
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you can't control the filter. maybe contact voxility that they block your packets
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (in the future, we might have HTTPS masters, but even these will likely still check for UDP connectivity with your server)
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can't connect to your server btw
18:39 <+Davide> Voxility cannot "whitelist" those packets because they are similar to an attack that can cause problems
18:40 <+Davide> @heinrich5991 it is strange, I'm in the server currently
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> heartbeat packets can be distinguished by being outgoing from your server
18:41 <+Davide> Voxility doesn't check the outbound traffic unfortunately
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean itâ€™s completely reasonable that you can join if their automatic rule is fw**
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I can't join)
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Good thing we never tried voxillity. Massive links but as with all other providers apparently theyâ€™ll protect themselves even if you are within the limits of your link
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its cheaper to get rid of us
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is this not some sort of fraud btw? I guess they bury it somewhere in the contract that they can actually limit the link however they want fuck you?
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "[...] reserves the right to filter to protect the network [...]", probably
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Such silliness. Here you go a 10g link, but you can only use as much as we feel like
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When are we getting our own backbone link and datacenter? ;P
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, Davide if you want your server to appear on the masterserver list it needs to reply to heartbeats, no way around it
18:46 <+Davide> Okay 
18:49 <+Davide> @heinrich5991 can you try here 45.141.57.6:3000 ?
18:49 <+Davide> If you can join now 
18:56 <+Davide> However yes, an https heartbeats would be best
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that's only for the far future
18:56 <+Davide> Rip
18:57 <+Davide> [2021-03-16 18:56:29][register]: WARNING: No master servers. Retrying in 60 seconds
18:57 <+Davide> Connection with players possible but heartbeats no
18:57 <+Davide> xD
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No master servers suggests that either your `cou2`s or the servers `siz2`s don't make it through
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think it's the heartbeats since you don't even start sending beats until you choose a master
19:02 <+Davide> Mmm, that's probably true, what kind of method do you use to choose the server?
19:02 <+Davide> Ping? (I don't think)
19:04 <+Davide> https://sc.lowhosting.org/itAAMzMqwLJr all seems fine with pings
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We do `cou2` (get count) to all masters, we get `siz2` (count) from the masters, after a timeout or if we get all counts we pick the one with the least count, then you start sending `bea2` (heartbeats) periodically
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in that stage we're happy if we receive any answer at all
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The master server will reply with a `fw??`, the server should reply with `fw!!`, if your `fw!!` gets through you'll get a `fwok` if it doesn't you'll get a `fwer`
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you'd gotten to the fw check stage you'd get a port forwarding error or if you never get the fw?? a "switching master"
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lmk the ip of your server and I can tcpdump on the master to see if your cou2s are getting through
19:09 <+Davide> Is there a way to force the server "selection"  and go with a statically chosen server? (maybe from the config)
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (but I'd guess that is highly unlikely to be the issue and it's most likely an issue with "siz2" never making it through voxility's filter)
19:10 <+Davide> The outgoing bandwidth is not managed by Voxility but by me, so the packet comes to you for sure, the problem is the answer from you to me
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't actually know if you can force the server to use a master, masters.cfg is such a stupid file that I ended up just modifying the register code
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you've been looking at the register code too, do you know how to force a master?
19:14 <+Davide> http://sc.lowhosting.org/CdOlroXROnRJ
19:14 <+Davide> This is the packet that Voxility filter
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, that's part of the register process so if you never receive that it won't work
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can ask them to maybe whitelist it from the ip of the master you choose?
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or you can try modifying the register code to skip the count check
19:16 <+Davide> Unfortunately Voxility has no Whitelist for IP due to the possibility of spoofing
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> FWIW their filter is breaking, it's their fault. I can only tell you the facts ðŸ˜›
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> what's wrong with that packet?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (honestly it's quite silly too, it's like filtering out SYN and saying it mitigates attacks, filtering all legitimate traffic will indeed stop an attack lol)
19:20 <+Davide> Voxility is a strange scrubbing provider, I already know that, but it is one of the only ones that can counter truly gigantic attacks
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They seem to "counter" it by blocking legit traffic, any hoster can do that. Try Linode they'll null route you even, 100% solution to all attacks
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Voxility's smart firewall or "smart" network engineers think it's an attack
19:21 <+Davide> Hahaha, btw the server is playable.
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For now. Next time you'll get an attack that's part of the core protocol and it won't work anymore
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Back at nfoservers they had to remove an automated rule like that all the time for us
19:28 <+Davide> All the rules are active, if I receive an attack nothing change 
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't get it is this rule against siz2 not something they added because of an attack?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's an essential part of teeworlds protocol, it's like blocking all SYNs because people do SYN Flooding. That's silly imo
19:30 <+Davide> No, it has always been blocked
19:30 <+Davide> It is not something due to an attack
19:31 <+Davide> It seems that Voxility has always seen this as illegitimate traffic
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd guess it's a reaction to a reflection attack against someone else. They don't randomly make rules like this
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Letting them know it's legitimate traffic is all you can do
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> imagine world where edge routers of all autonomous systems are configured correctly so no packets with spoofed source IP can reach the global internet ðŸ˜„
19:43 <+Davide> I would say it is an almost impossible hope: D
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> maybe IPv6 is the way because many "admins" refuse to use it
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Isps*?
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 you can force a master by making all the other masters point to non-functional addresses
