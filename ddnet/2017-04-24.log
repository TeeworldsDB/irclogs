00:03 < HMH> does this output your sqlconfig if you put this to rcon: dump_sqlservers w; dump_sqlservers r
00:06 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Im waiting for account system!
00:06 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> make one
00:06 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Accounts are shit
00:06 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> also how would you transfer points?
00:07 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> manually?
00:07 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> hah
00:07 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Accounts suck
00:07 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> No one want this shit
00:07 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Sure Konsti
00:07 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> wait, I think we had this discussion before
00:07 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> no one, but that tens people
00:07 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe hundreds
00:08 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Just saying
00:08 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Accounts are shit
00:08 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I see, then logout from discord
00:08 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> be as a guest
00:08 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> It's about ddnet, not everything else
00:09 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> That argument is invalid
00:09 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> "Accounts are shit" isn't an argument
00:09 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> touché
00:09 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> so why i would to give you one?
00:09 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> No its a fact
00:09 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> no it isn't
00:09 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's fact in your head
00:09 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> (it's called OPINION)
00:09 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> children, please
00:09 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> psst, psst
00:10 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Its a fact because most of players dont want them
00:10 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> actually, i saw a lot of different opinions.
00:10 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> https://tenor.co/FaWO.gif
00:10 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> http://i.imgur.com/yc0sA92.png
00:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yup, i was here once
00:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> as a guest
00:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> then i logged in 😃
00:11 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> what
00:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> No idea
00:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> this account has more than year..
00:12 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> ok w/e let's get back to the topic How would you handle this: I have over 2000 points and dont want to loose it. How can I sync my progress with the account?
00:12 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Maybe,  my name is saved in chat history and that's why you can still mention the old one.
00:14 < Learath2> we'll figure sth out no worries
00:15 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> Make it automatic: People will abuse it Make it manually: You will have way too much work
00:15 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> CookieAlex i love you
00:15 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yup, it would be hard. I didn't said that. But actually, accounts gives you and to network a few great benefits.  For example, better banning botters, more safe administration and moderation of servers (you don't need to have password to rcon, if you are logged in as a moderator)
00:15 < Learath2> well it can't ever be completely automatic but if we can get it 90% there automatically
00:16 <@heinrich5991> better banning botters -> no
00:16 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> no, because?
00:16 < Learath2> and virtually no faking
00:16 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> And its shit to give other guys your savecode or your timeout
00:16 < Learath2> botters don't care about points
00:16 < Learath2> thus its pointless to ban their accounts
00:16 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but care about e-mails?
00:17 <@heinrich5991> admin/mod authentication will probably benefit from that
00:17 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know, you can use 10-minutes mail etc
00:17 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Learath you should stop work at it, deen will not implement accounts
00:17 < Learath2> who said anything about mail
00:17 <@heinrich5991> now you want to require email, really?
00:17 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> wait wait
00:17 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i don't want to require anything. just takling
00:17 < Learath2> i'll fork it out and run my own servers with blackjack and hookers
00:17 < Learath2> :P
00:17 <@heinrich5991> .
00:17 <@heinrich5991> :)
00:17 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> how about... 2 factor authentication
00:17 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> jk
00:18 < Learath2> deen does seem to not like things i make in general :P /s
00:18 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> KISS
00:18 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> if I remember?
00:19 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Teeworlds rule ? 😄
00:19 < Learath2> we are way past KISS here
00:19 < Learath2> just look at that sql code :P
00:19 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> haha, true
00:19 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> are you talking about the acronym or about smooching?
00:19 < Learath2> well what would smooching have to do with sql code?
00:20 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> I dont fetish shame you
00:20 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> btw, then maybe
00:20 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's idea. Account system just for moderators
00:20 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> to keep safe servers?
00:21 < Learath2> well the current way is safe enough
00:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> DDNet has 4 years, probably more than 40k registered players nicknames
00:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Not really, someone can spread password
00:21 <@heinrich5991> everyone has their own password now
00:21 < Learath2> do you even follow the development?
00:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> okay, nevermind
00:22 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> And if i dont want to have an account?
00:23 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> what are the benefits of an account?
00:24 <@heinrich5991> good night :) this sounds like it could become a long discussion
00:24 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Famebitches cant get faked omg yeeees
00:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> not really
00:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I stopped thread now.
00:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> read thread on forum
00:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> people discussed and gave some ideas
00:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Goodnight
00:25 < Learath2> the accounts will be just for rcon auth and verifying someone is who they say they are
00:25 < Learath2> atleast for now
00:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> with TID?
00:25 < Learath2> TID?
00:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or DID? :PP
00:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> TeeworldsID
00:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> DDNet ID
00:26 < Learath2> well no idea what to call it, but yeah thats the gist of it
00:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yup would be the best.
00:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Then you will have no trouble with changing name 😛
00:27 < Learath2> everyone gets an id, you prove to the server you own that id, the server tells everyone you own that id, thus one can for certain know that the person that has that id is who they think they are
00:27 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Omgffff pls dont make it possible to change ur name
00:27 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> why not?
00:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Roftl
00:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> xD
00:27 < Learath2> my god you are insuferable
00:28 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Please! no account! They will troll us!
00:28 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> "okay, you can change your nickname"
00:28 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> PLEASE NOO, Don't make it possible!"
00:28 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> I mean
00:28 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Cmon. .
00:28 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Dont make it possible to transfer points
00:28 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> It wouldn't be possible to transfer points lol
00:28 < Learath2> JUST LET ME TRY FIND A WAY
00:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> But, the ID is good idea
00:29 < Learath2> if it's not possible we won't implement it
00:29 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> OR JUST STOP WORKING ON THIS
00:29 < Learath2> fuck me
00:29 < Learath2> good night
00:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> goodnight 😉
00:29 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Sleep Bad so that you are not able do work on it :)
00:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> tbh Learath2, it could work like a timeout protection
00:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you send command with key to server, and you are logged in, yea
00:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> fast and simple
00:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> even with standard teeworlds
00:31 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> ugh, manual work
00:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Ugh, with ddnet
00:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> no
00:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> timeout protection key is send automatically
00:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> when you connect to ddnet
00:31 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> ya ik
00:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> so it would be one-time work
00:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Good night
10:58 <@deen> Learath2: i will only merge /invite in again if it gets fixed for spamming
10:58 < Learath2> you already fixed the spamming by removing uninvite
10:58 <@deen> every command that produces chat messages needs to be spam-filtered
10:58 <@deen> no, that did not fix it
10:58 <@deen> i got reports that you could still cause spam by using a few more commands in combination
10:58 < Learath2> the only person you can spam with it is yourself
10:59 <@deen> something like /invite;lock;lock;invite;lock;lock;invite;lock;lock etc
10:59 < Learath2> well you can spam as fast as you can switch teams
10:59 < Learath2> i don't see any other way
10:59 < Learath2> huh
10:59 < Learath2> i'll check it out
11:00 < Learath2> see instead of nuking it out of the orbit just because you don't use it you could have just told me the combination
11:00 <@deen> that was a quick fix
11:00 <@deen> i don't think we have a flag for disabling it or i would've used that
11:00 <@deen> because i got reports from people being spammed again
11:01 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Maybe allow only one invite per player until he /agree or /disagree ?
11:03 < Learath2> fixed
11:03 < Learath2> atleast that one combination
11:07 <@deen> as I said, make sure it uses spam protection

11:47 < Learath2> deen: i did ask for help on that i just wasn't sure where the rate limiting belonged
11:48 < Learath2> if i limit the command then inviting a big team takes too long, if i limit it per person i wouldn't be able to use a bitmask anymore

13:28 < Learath2> lock is not delayed
13:28 < ddnet-discord> <bob> i like coords
13:29 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> I know, just saying if you want To fix spam by delay it

13:44 < ddnet-discord> <deen> Suggestions on how to fix the annoying voting stuff? (see #general)
13:46 < ddnet-discord> <bob> lifeban SP | Someone
13:51 < Learath2> mfw i have to go to discord again :D
13:52 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Limitation? By nickname, for example you can vote 3 times, then you have to wait some magic time (like 5 minutes or so)
13:53 < ddnet-discord> <bob> hardcode a ban on the name "SP | Someone"
13:53 < Learath2> isnt there a frequency thing on votes already?
13:53 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, 30 seconds?
13:53 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Mol?
13:53 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and always every 30 seconds  if i remember
13:54 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> 180 seconds
13:54 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> And 50 after join
13:54 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i meant, some kind of ban to vote for more time
13:54 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ok, so It was on Vanilla then (haha)
13:54 < Learath2> and how does he bypass the timer?
13:54 < ddnet-discord> <bob> hes a hacker
13:54 < Learath2> ask him he likes to brag about it
13:55 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Ah, the delay is only for failed votes
13:55 < ddnet-discord> <jao> @bob they don't want to ban names 😢
13:55 < Learath2> well lets make the delay for all votes
13:55 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Huh.
13:55 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Lol, he can just take another Name omg
13:55 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> No
13:55 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> why not?
13:56 < Learath2> b/c konsti likes to oppose me for no reason :)
13:56 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Learath, just make it like:
13:57 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and one mor
13:57 < ddnet-discord> <bob> add a vote delay on succsesfull votes
13:57 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> He's voting himself
13:57 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> his dummy
13:57 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> For kickvotes need to be 5 players on Server, make it so that in a team also need to be 5 players or just disable votes in team
13:57 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe we should disable possibility to vote characters on same IP?
13:57 < ddnet-discord> <bob> good idea he only has 1 ip
13:57 < Learath2> actually why do we even allow kick in teams?
13:57 < ddnet-discord> <jao> disable specvotes too
13:57 < ddnet-discord> <jao> ez fix
13:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Learath2, it is allowed ?
13:58 < ddnet-discord> <bob> disable all votes and chatting ez fix all bugs
13:58 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Just kick and specvotes in team need to be disabled, they are unnecessary
13:58 < Learath2> matricks had a branch without nicknames for tees and no chat
13:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😄
13:58 < Learath2> anonymous teeworlds
13:58 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> We should try it
13:59 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Everyone would have same amount of points
13:59 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😃
14:00 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> The first solution, should be to disable self-voting (even with dummy)
14:06 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #751: Add ratelimiting for /invite (master...dd_pr_ratelimitinvite) https://git.io/v9IB3
14:18 < Learath2> if i call for a vote inside a team do other people see the vote?
14:19 <@deen> yes
14:19 <@deen> the current system only allows for 1 vote and everyone sees that
14:19 < Learath2> and do other people get to vote?
14:19 <@deen> no
14:19 < Learath2> do you happen to know where we make that happen?
14:19 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> So just hide it?
14:20 <@deen> i remember writing it, i don#t remember where^^
14:20 <@deen> even if you hide it, then no one else can vote while someone is doing that
14:20 <@deen> there are a few approaches:
14:20 <@deen> 1. allow 1 vote per team at once
14:20 <@deen> 2. don't allow voting within team at all
14:21 <@deen> 3. delay even after successful vote
14:21 < Learath2> i'd go with 2 but i can't seem to find where we did that :P
14:21 <@deen> gamecontext.cpp, CL_CALLVOTE
14:22 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> I think voting in a team has no need am i right? You can just join another team or use /save if u want an afk guy awax
14:22 <@deen> yeah, we used to kick people out of a team, but if there's invite that's not really neded
14:23 < Learath2> deen: yeah can prevent it there but we'd have some unnecessary logic somewhere in the voting code leftover
14:23 < Learath2> maybe we should let people within teams vote but like all other people
14:24 <@deen> don't understand that
14:24 < Learath2> let them vote in team0 votes and let them vote for people in team0
14:24 <@deen> easy way to find a place in the code: trigger the situation on a server and grep for the error message in code
14:25 <@deen> but it should just be in gamecontext.cpp
14:25 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Would be unfair if Team 0 trolls can kick teamplayers
14:25 <@deen> search for GetDDRaceTeam(ClientID) within the vote calling
14:26 < Learath2> how do you account for the team when counting the votes?
14:26 < Learath2> thats what i'm after
14:27 <@deen> well, i showed you
14:27 <@deen> each player just has a flag if they votes yes/no/nothing yet
14:27 <@deen> and we just iterate over all players and ignore those in another team
14:32 < Learath2> well are we okay with "no votes in team, no votes affecting team members"
14:33 <@deen> not sure, have to think through all the consequences
14:34 <@deen> what if you play in a team for a few hours, one guy dies and goes afk, while lying in freeze
14:34 <@deen> now the team can never finish
14:34 <@deen> usually they would just vote him to spec or kic khim
14:34 < ddnet-discord> <jao> they can save and kick vote him in team 0 then
14:34 < Learath2> cant load the team tho
14:34 <@deen> haha
14:34 < ddnet-discord> <jao> replace him with dummy
14:34 < ddnet-discord> <jao> or some other guy
14:34 <@deen> that's a ridiculous workaround
14:35 <@deen> shouldn't have to resort to that
14:35 < Learath2> well team votes should only move to team 0
14:36 <@deen> yeah, but if the server has /spec enabled then you can't move to spec
14:36 <@deen> so you'd have to modify the kick behavious to move them to team 0 instead
14:36 <@deen> and the /spec-enabled spec vote is weird anyway, i'm not sure it even works at all
14:36 < Learath2> it doesn't work now but it works in my pull req :P
14:37 < Learath2> yeah we'd need to modify the kick behaviour but the word is still suitable :) You get kicked out of the team
14:45 <@deen> sounds ok
14:53 < Learath2> i have no idea how to make that happen without rewriting a lot of the vote code :/
14:54 <@deen> line 2291 etc
14:54 <@deen> move to eam 0 instead of kick/ban
14:55 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> oh are we okay with 1 concurrent vote?
15:00 <@deen> yeah, i guess
15:00 <@deen> it's good when everyone can see what votes are going on
15:00 <@deen> then mods can observe
15:00 <@deen> and otherwise we need to complicate the code even more
15:22 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> "one cant vote people from their ip" does that sound fair?
15:23 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> What you mean
15:23 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i can't vote my own dummy f.e.
15:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I said that
15:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> look ad SP
15:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> he voting himself
15:25 <@deen> just connect from multiple ips
15:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and in as a result, he's spamming by voting
15:25 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or maybe i still don't understand what you want to say 😄
15:26 <@deen> Learath2: that's a bad idea, what if your brother is afk and you want to move him to spec?
15:28 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's possible, to check if its your dummy?
15:29 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well no not reliably atleast
15:32 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
15:32 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I don't know, if your brother
15:32 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> is afk
15:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can go to his comptuer
15:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and go spec
15:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> xD
15:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Unless you are lazy as fu...
15:34 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> so it shouldn't be problem, to disable self-voting (on same ip)
15:35 <@deen> ok, what if you're from a country that has a single IP address for all citizens?
15:35 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> those exist?
15:35 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> anyways it doesn't fix any problem
15:35 <@deen> (you don't want to get kicked then, but spec-vote would be ok)
15:36 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> no need to remove self-voting
15:36 <@deen> Quatar?
15:36 <@deen> but they use a few more addresses nowadays
15:36 <@deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:82.148.97.69
15:36 <@deen> "This is the IP address for the entire nation of Qatar. As such it is a very sensitive IP address to block and any prolonged blocks are likely to wind up in the news. As such please exercise extreme caution when deciding to block this IP address."

15:37 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I was talking about this problem
15:37 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> self-voting -> spamming
15:38 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> so, we can make exceptions?
15:38 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> for Qatar, for example
15:39 <@heinrich5991> self-voting is not necessarily spamming, is it?
15:39 <@deen> no, just don't forbid spec-voting your own ip
15:54 < ddnet-discord> <BeaR> my 2ct, a window of last votes (maybe last 5) and add time limitation if the length between the current and the first vote is too small.
15:55 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> hey, just wanted to throw idea, could you please add some command that would lock team only if it is locked already? or just modify currently existing /lock so I can do /lock 1 and it won't unlock
15:55 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> >lock team only if it not locked already *
15:55 <@deen> i don#t understand
15:55 <@deen> just use /lock 1 or /lock 0?
15:56 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> O LOL
15:56 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> it didn't work recently :x maybe i misstyped
15:56 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> nvm then
16:01 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Again self-voting
16:01 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/306067146683711488/eJwFwVsOhCAMAMC7cABa0fLwNoikmqgQWr82e3dnfuYdl1nNodplBdhPKW3sVrSNzNVya3zV3E-xpd2QVXM57vqogCM3U8SI5FxY.png
16:06 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> can I invite more ppl like /invite A B C?
16:06 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> nope
16:07 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> that sounds like a nice idea
16:07 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> will look into it after i fix the vote stuff
16:07 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> what if someone has space in nickname?
16:07 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> people have spaces in names that's why i am asking
16:07 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> /invite "test test"
16:07 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
16:07 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but then, someone could have " in nickname as well
16:09 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> escaping obviously
16:09 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> /invite ""test""
16:10 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> not everyone will know
16:10 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> pf
16:10 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well you'll have to invite one by one
16:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> escaping isn't that obvious
16:19 <@heinrich5991> CookieAlex: /invite test test should work even today
16:19 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> I guess you meant @CookieMichal
16:19 <@heinrich5991> oh, didn't see the suggestion, nvm
16:20 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/751 does it mean I won't be able to do:  "say /team 37 say /lock 1; say /invite CookieMichal; say /invite CookieAlex; say /invite W33Ð; say /invite CookieAlex²" ?
16:24 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> exactly
16:24 <@deen> btw, get rid of all those says
16:25 <@deen> just use say /team 37;lock 1;invite foo;invite bar
16:25 <@deen> (I think)
16:25 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i couldn't find a way to limit it per person without writing way too complex code
16:25 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> deen: doesn't really work :v
16:26 <@deen> too bad
16:26 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i'd need to keep an array of ticks
16:26 <@deen> Learath2: not saying that's a good idea, but 64bit bitfield?
16:26 <@deen> hm, no
16:27 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i have an 64bit bitfield now
16:27 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> per team
16:27 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> with tick() you get integer?
16:27 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if i want rate limiting per person i'd need an array 64 of ticks to keep when you invited someone
16:29 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> 64x64 array :v
16:29 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> not too nice 😄
16:32 <@deen> ask heinrich5991 what he thinks!
16:32 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> or do it teamspeak way
16:34 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> everytime you invite someone you get some points (let's say 200) and when you go over limit (let's say 500) you can't invite anyone until it goes back to 0
16:34 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> and on each tick u get -1
16:35 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> heinrich5991 what do you think
16:36 <@heinrich5991> I'm currently in a lecture /o\
16:36 <@heinrich5991> ask me again in 10min
17:13 <@heinrich5991> 10min over
17:15 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if i want to ratelimit invites per player i need an array 64 of ticks on each player
17:17 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> heinrich5991 ^^
17:22 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> thats 8byte tick * 64 players * 64 players = 33KB of data 😛
17:24 <@heinrich5991> mh
17:36 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/v9Ihx
17:36 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 4b376d2 def: rename
17:36 <@deen> I disabled /spec for now
17:36 <@deen> ehm, spec-vote
17:36 <@deen> not /spec
17:38 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> How long will it take to allow kickvotes again?  Its really annoying
17:39 <@heinrich5991> we could disable saves instead
17:39 <@heinrich5991> until we figure out the correct solution to that load problem *and* test it
17:39 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> What load Problem?
17:40 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Ah yes
17:40 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we figured out 3 solutions
17:40 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> can we just chose one and test it now?
17:41 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> If you want to load a savegame the players have to /agree first maybe?
17:41 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we have that, we have players must be teamed up beforehand, and all need to /load passwd
17:41 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> first two are already in pullreqs but not tested
17:42 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: if you invite people to a team, why can you even invite them again?
17:42 <@heinrich5991> irc client broke
17:42 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you can't
17:42 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Solution 2 is my Favorite if u can get loaded in your Favorite team
17:42 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> And not in random team with ugly colour x)
17:43 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> heinrich5991  i already fixed the spams we know about but deen doesn't seem to be convinced 😃
17:43 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> heinrich5991 aa3690a632dd9cbd5e8c58faf016a9f282f5317b can you cherry pick this?
17:44 <@heinrich5991> link plz
17:44 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i forgot to put it in the last pr
17:44 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/751/commits/aa3690a632dd9cbd5e8c58faf016a9f282f5317b
17:44 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> the rest of the pr is questionable but should get the first one atleast
17:52 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: so, invite is currently enabled and you want that commit in?
17:53 <@heinrich5991> and what was deen's opinion about that?
18:00 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> deen merged invite
18:01 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> before i could get that commit in
18:01 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> without that you can block teams forever
18:02 < ddnet-discord> <Konsti> Nice!
19:09 <@deen> I just noticed that the mozilla irc server is really unfriendly
19:09 <@deen> "This server is for use by Mozilla developers, testers, and users. If you are not one, please find another server."
19:18 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> 😄
19:22 < Ryozuki> i guess they have lot of chrome users?
19:22 < Ryozuki> "Mozilla runs an IRC server to host channels for discussion of topics related to the Mozilla project. "
19:23 < Ryozuki> i find it logic
19:23 <@deen> but you're not allowed if you don't use Firefox or another Mozilla product^^
19:23 < Ryozuki> if u dont, why would u go there?
19:23 <@deen> I'm there to listen in on rust discussions
19:24 <@deen> but I'm not even a rust user
19:24 <@deen> luckily i coincidentally use firefox, otherwise I'd have to leave
19:24 < Ryozuki> well, u don't have to tell you dont use them :)
19:24 <@deen> sure, but it's just a ridiculous rule to have
19:24 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> spying on rust discussions to steal their ideas and implement them in nim?
19:25 < ddnet-discord> <bob> nim sucks
19:25 < Ryozuki> that sure went to Learath2 ? :D (joke)
19:25 < Ryozuki> nim doesn't suck
19:26 < Ryozuki> i like custom operators
20:15 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> who wrote smh and tried to delete it?
20:53 <@heinrich5991> smh?
21:10 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] d3fault opened pull request #752: Add show angle in debug (master...show-angle-in-debug) https://git.io/v9LaN
21:12 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> meant to write something
21:13 <@heinrich5991> why aren't you on irc btw? ^^
21:13 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> other computer
21:13 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> does anyone knows a shop where i can buy a pi zero w inexpensive?
21:17 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I will steal it for you
21:17 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> really? 😍
21:18 <@heinrich5991> are they in stock again?
21:18 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> I dont know, but I want one
21:18 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> Rust took 14gb of memory crashed my browser and steam...
21:18 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yeah, sweety ❤
21:18 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Rust? This all-the-time in alpha
21:18 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> game?
21:18 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> sorry
21:18 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> in early access
21:19 <@heinrich5991> rust-the-language or rust-the-game? ^^
21:19 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> I guess the game
21:19 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> since programming languages usually arent on steam
21:20 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> 🤔
21:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> haha
21:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or maybe
21:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> he just compiled something
21:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> it took 14gb memory
21:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> and crashed browser and steaem
21:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😮
21:21 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> forkbomb?
21:23 < Ryozuki> :(){ :|: & };:
21:24 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> void main(){while(1){fork();}}
21:24 <@heinrich5991> *int main
21:24 <@heinrich5991> plz
21:24 < Ryozuki> xD
21:24 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> ¯_(ツ)_/¯
21:24 <@heinrich5991> int main(void) if you're coding c
21:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i would like to learn c or c++ 😦
21:24 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but im so laaazy
21:25 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> :(){ :|:& };: \_/| |||| ||\- ... the function ':', initiating a chain-reaction: each ':' will start    two more.  | | |||| |\- Definition ends now, to be able to run ...  | | |||| \- End of function-block  | | |||\- disown the functions (make them a background process), so that the children    of a parent  | | |||   will not be killed when the parent gets auto-killed  | | ||\- ... another copy of the ':'-function, which has

21:25 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> thanks for the copy pasta @Ryozuki
21:25 < Ryozuki> xD, its well formated on discord
21:25 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> what the fuck is that
21:25 < Ryozuki> the explanation of the forkbomb isent
21:25 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> no shit
21:25 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> everyone knows unix forkbomb :l
21:25 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> but not why it is like that
21:26 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> alright alright
21:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i didn't knew
21:26 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> 😦
21:27 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> have you ever been using linux?
21:27 <@heinrich5991> Savander: have you tried any programming language already? :)
21:27 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes
21:28 < Ryozuki> php
21:28 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i am PHP programmer already
21:28 < Ryozuki> right?
21:28 < Ryozuki> :P
21:28 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> so how is everyone doing tonight?
21:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I used linux
21:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but rather to nginx
21:29 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> than to make scripts
21:30 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> what's nginx?
21:30 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/v9LoG
21:30 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 3878d6f Learath2: Reset invites when the team is empty
21:30 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> nginx?
21:31 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> http server
21:31 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> ah
21:31 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> rust the game 😛
21:32 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i have tested nginx-rtmp-module
21:32 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Livestreaming on your own! oh yea!
21:32 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> I prefer to write my own http servers ¯_(ツ)_/¯
21:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i know, node.js
21:33 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> or java ee
21:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> then great. I can't do it
21:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> so i using nginx
21:33 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or apache2
21:33 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> okok
21:33 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> maybe someday
21:34 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> probably not
21:34 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Iam to lazy
21:35 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: cherry-picked it
21:36 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> thx :3
21:40 < ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> nginx is good
22:14 < ddnet-discord> <Welf> i suggest to learn brainfuck programming language
22:14 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> hello
22:15 < ddnet-discord> <bob> hi
22:18 <@deen> Welf: Good, you can even combine brainfuck with nim: http://howistart.org/posts/nim/1/
22:19 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> nimfuck?
22:20 < Ryozuki> https://esolangs.org/wiki/Pyth
22:20 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> have to admit that irc<-->discord bridge was very good idea
22:21 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I agree
22:21 <@deen> feels like irc gets spammed a lot now, not sure how the quiet irc majority feels about that
22:22 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> noone forces anyone  : P
22:22 < ddnet-discord> <bob> @deen spam
22:22 < Ryozuki> well, that irc majority never talks :o
22:22 < ddnet-discord> <bob> @deen spam
22:23 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> bob, go troll on #general
22:23 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> don't delete messages as they stay in logs T_T
22:23 < ddnet-discord> <bob> waht logs
22:23 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> irc logs
22:23 < ddnet-discord> <bob> this is discord
22:23 < ddnet-discord> <bob> noob
22:23 < ddnet-discord> <CookieMichal> can we kick him?
22:23 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> sure
22:23 < ddnet-discord> <bob> sry for calling you noob
22:23 < ddnet-discord> <bob> pls forgive me
22:45 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex>  S I L I C O N  V A L L E Y  S E A S O N  4  E P I S O D E  1 ! ! ! ! 
22:45 < Ryozuki> dont spam
22:45 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> It's one message
22:46 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> using that logic, your reply is also considered spam
22:46 < Ryozuki> ur message looks horrible on irc
22:46 < ddnet-discord> <CookieAlex> cant confirm that
