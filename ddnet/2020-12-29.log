01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen i think the cl_showdistance is almost twice as wide and high as the fov
02:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> for envelop animation on vanilla, we just fmod the time with envelop loop length to avoid large float/int conversion and division instead of changing precisions.
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just removed roundstarttime accidentially
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> floats stay inconsistent, even if u only use small floats
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> much more horrible is that i found a GL 3.3 bug while debugging this issue xd
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> even tho its just a "renders too few things" bug, not critical ðŸ˜„
03:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :thonk:
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but it did work for synced animation with high tick numbers for vanilla.
03:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @TsFreddie working != working accuratly ðŸ˜„
03:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :thonk: sure
03:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also synced animations are more accurate anyway
03:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs they recalculate the time every time
03:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I thought the problem is they lag due to lack of precisions
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, im not sure if ctf2 has synced envs, but i fixed it on ctf2
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> #3002
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3002
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there is a video xd
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> ctf2 has synced snow for some reason
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> appearently not on 0.6?
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just opened it in editor to look
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Maybe it's a 0.7 thing
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway
03:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u want to check my impl against 0.7 u need to simulate adding floats every time
03:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> e.g. adding a constant time that happens per frame to the float
03:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and if they not the same after lets say 1h
03:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then the floating point inaccuracy kicked in
03:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> my guess is, that 0.7 is around 100ms off after 1h ðŸ˜„
03:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Nvm it was dm3
03:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I means if all clients are 100ms off then it is still synced ðŸ™ƒ
03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜„
03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it depends on the frame times probs
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> adding a float 1000 times instead of 60 times should make a relativly huge difference
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> depending on what u call huge xd
03:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Oh you mean client animation?
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Synced animations are always calculated iirc
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean non synced
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats why linked the issue
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wait
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we talked about the 1h thing
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜„
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> im confused now too xD
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> ðŸ™ƒ
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah non sycned for 1h
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Ok
03:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so yeah ctf2 snow should be synced i guess
03:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Well if anyone want a playtime clock on the map I guess making it accurate is good.
03:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> true, it obviously doesnt matter too much
03:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tw used this shitty implementation for like 10 years and nobody really cared
03:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i love accuracy
03:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and so or so, CPUs dont even give accurate timers anyway ðŸ˜„
03:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> accurate in a matter of ACCURATE
03:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> One sec is localtime() busted
03:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Oh 0.7 changed non synced animation completely I guess
04:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well u will know better
04:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont look into the code regulary
04:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Non synced animation is just `s_Time = Client()->LocalTime()` on vanilla for some reason.
04:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ddnet is as accurate as 0.0000000000000001 compared to what current pysics can currently meassure
04:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so pretty bad xd
04:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> of and *100 if we dont choose 1 as 100%
04:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh and *100 if we dont choose 1 as 100%
04:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> So you can't make a clock with non synced envelope at all on vanilla. Huh
04:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> isnt localtime just increasing value?
04:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its a function i'd prefer to remove from ddnet, bcs of the reasons of inaccuracy
04:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I see
04:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway, its just me over dramatize
04:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Well localtime is time_get() - starttime
04:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Just checked
04:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> saved as float?
04:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or as int?
04:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> It's a int64 arithmetic divided by time_freq.
04:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it only matters what it is stored in
04:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> float
04:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but u said `s_Time = Client()->LocalTime()`
04:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so its fine anyway
04:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the 0.6 code did not do that
04:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :thonk: I wonder why they changed it
04:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs its more accurate
04:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> And probably less code to worry about
04:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
04:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> s_Time += pThis->LocalTime() - s_LastLocalTime;
04:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>             s_LastLocalTime = pThis->LocalTime();
04:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
04:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that was the old ddnet version
04:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I would imagine they care about simplicity more
04:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i c
04:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tho it also makes it pretty accurate, since its calculated every time freshly
04:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> But it does make sense. Why do you need to keep track of a non synced timer anyway
04:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so that makes my claim wrong btw
04:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> So they just made non synced envelope purely for animation and nothing else then.

08:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut that's ok, people can just come flying in quickly and you still want to see them immediately
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> can i disable timeout protection on my own server and just disconnect/destroy timed-out player
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> conn_timeout_protection 0
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> thanks :)
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <markgraf> Where is CNetObj_PlayerInput defined? Is there a macros that added "PlayerInput" at the end or smth.?
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <markgraf> Where is CNetObj_PlayerInput defined? Is there a macros that adds "PlayerInput" at the end or smth.?
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> datasrc/network.py, look for PlayerInput
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You generally don't want to change the existing objects though, you can add your own NetObjectEx
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <markgraf> ah thx
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª How risky are your bug fixes, should I ship them in next quick fix release without RC?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen yes add them
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen @Learath2 the performance sucks bcs fully transparent quads are drawn too
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> We could just skip them
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds like too much work
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at least for this release
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen its 2 lines for non gl 3.3 and 4 lines for gl 3.3 ðŸ˜„
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i force pushed, can u get teh current commit instead?
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for GL 3.3 its not that easy, bcs of the shader difference
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think I got the correct one
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> atleast in these github things it doesnt look like it
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> which things?
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> these popups
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> when clicking them
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ah, github wasn't updating your change for me
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> alright ðŸ˜„
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Wait, so with OpenGL3 there will be no improvement? :/
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, i dont want to risk too much coding rn
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but with default settings its optimized
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and most ppl probs play on default anyway
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll patch it for gl 3.3 later, but it requires the correct quad offset ðŸ˜„
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What was wrong with the change you made previously?
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean i can patch it, if u want
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> takes me maybe 10 minutes, and maybe some testing quickly
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then let's wait with the release I guess
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cancel bors then?=
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or new pr?

15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> do i have to try to keep the CID consistent to a character to stop them from jumping around?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> btw i'm manually snapping characters and players based on some fake dummy data. if it wasn't clearðŸ˜†
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie yes changing cids create these issues. The 64p patch has an algorithm to keep the cids stable-ish when mapping to vanilla
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i'm not using that since i'm allowing people join without seeing each other, so i just hack their cid to be always 0, and 1 through 63 will be the dummies
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i'll try something else then
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> This is the first time in years that i'm making a server mod, where i can just mess up the code so bad and still don't need to worry about it.
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> feels good :kek:

20:31 <+ChillerDragon> actually neat idea but im not sure if it just makes demo names longer without any additional information @gerdoe do u have a usecase?
20:32 <+ChillerDragon> in the demo browser u can see the gametype in the metadata anyways
20:32 <+ChillerDragon> might help identifiying vanilla vs zCatch demos faster
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i don't see any metadata with gametype in ddnet client rn
