00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, I read Jupeyy's patch now and am reasonable certain that it won't break anything now
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cant u just test them on a testing server
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think I would have caught this bug by testing tbh
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> no money to open test servers @louis  :p, and no profit
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> look at RC, 2 ppl use them
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the devs are pretty much alone with testing most of the time
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> me and who else :monkalaugh:
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hussain xd
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm also on RC
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> What i personally like, but e.g. deen dislikes is to deploy it to a certain % of players
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for server it would just restart a certain % of servers then
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> e.g. google's play console has a tool for this
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye or just have a dedicated group of ppl that rigorously test but its a small game and not many ppl would volunteer to do that
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah :c
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ill volunteer
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but keep in mind, e.g. heinrichs pr requires fast testing, maybe max of 1 day
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so in that time you'd need to be here and test everything and that can be time consuming, boring stressy
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But generally defs a possibility
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for other prs there could be a nightly server, but maybe unranked, or any better idea?
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nightly server is a good idea + a role for dev testing
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> then everyone can join and test
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but anyway thats a decision by the admins ðŸ˜„
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @louis @lynn @Jupstar âœª follow me for "nightly server"
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (ingame)
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no one coming? ^^
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> a
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> u lied
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no lies @lynn
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> louis joined me
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i didnt see u at first
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> was making food xD
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Did some new Method for filtering Chat got implemented with the latest server upgrade?
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> explain
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> im pretty sure the n word wasnt converted to ****** before
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> not saying thats bad tho lol
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> or wait
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> heinrich dm pro
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or im too laggy

00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> oh its china only i see
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> then it can be older nvm
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> government ðŸ˜„
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @heinrich5991 later today or if it's too late this weekend, should do dm on USA
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> use what
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> release candidate
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ah xd
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @heinrich5991 apparently the startline thing broke for someone
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ye check up #bugs
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you tell me what the symptoms are @louis? which map?

01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> ^should be fixed already
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> its not the government its ddnet censoring it for them
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> they support ccp
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> their servers, their laws i guess
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> why there is no free vaccine on rus servers then
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> our government forcing it xd
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xD wow
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> come to germany and i give u vaccine
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd

11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Someone is missing some `NOT NULL` constraints in their db :D
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/868063080075124766/20210723_113214.jpg
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also my residence is completely wrong. I really hope I didnt mess that up and they wont arrest me for it
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i got my qr code
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> catalan flag > spain flag > eu flag
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/868064385120223232/unknown.png
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ez
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had one for the 1st dose. They told me it takes about 2 days to get the second one
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ours is just a lame paper card
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> because america
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i can request it at any time via the web
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> modern times
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Italy still doesnt accept fully vaccinated people from outside the eu without a test. Which is a shame, hopefully they fix it before I come back
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Covid tests are kinda expensive
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can too but it only becomes available after 2 days since it's italian bureaucracy, 4 different agencies cooperating
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We get both lame paper and cool qr code
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont have a paper
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Italians love paperwork
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i have qr code
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think everyone in the eu is in the qr code scheme now
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> i got chipped
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> really?
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i mean tha vaccine it self has plenty of tech in it so why use additional qr code? I mean I can literally see 5G rays now
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lmao
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You have a fair point. We should petition the eu to stop this waste of funds. The 5g chip is documentation enough

21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> "TLDR\: read the paper"
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hahahahaha

21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 if you find the time could you accept the pull requests for the ddnet bot and get them running?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Um sure, I'll try to get it in after I'm done packing
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> awesome :)
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> The great thing about creating a throwaway email account is that you don't have to confirm your email.
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> which provider you use for throwaway email accs?
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> [timakro](https://matrix.to/#/@timakro:matrix.org)\:
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I just needed a throwaway outlook account to check if my self hosted emails arrive in spam
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> And indeed they do
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Very interesting article on getting your self hosted mails delivered to inboxes (as opposed to spam) https://news.purelymail.com/posts/blog/2019-06-21-deliverability-for-the-rest-of-us.html
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> setting up a mail server is on my todo since forever
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> for what do you use your mail? arent u afraight of losing important stuff when shit goes sideways?
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i guess most people check their spam
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea sending but what if recieving breaks. Like your vps dies or something
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> domain expires whatever
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> might lose some important mails
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Or you die ðŸ˜®
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thats no problem i guess
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i wont care if i am dead
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I was receiving on my vps for years
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> not bad
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so its only me breaking things?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> receiving is easy, sending is hard
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> isn't that how the saying goes \:D
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wat saying \:;D
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> hmm, it had some downtime but the resend policy covers that, right?
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> idk baut the policy
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so when your server is down the sender is notified right?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and trys to resend?
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> yeah when mail can't be delivered the agent has to retry later when he gives up he still needs to notify the sender that the mail couldn't be delivered
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea seen that
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> idk just thought of that hamilton quote "dying is easy living is harder" when i wrote this xD not sure if it is a saying
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im not that well read
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> xd
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i mean the musical xD

22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> hah nice
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i made the most annoying captcha as a toy project years ago
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> let me see if i can find it
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> \:D
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> https://files.timakro.de/captcha_code_js_demo/
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hahah lmap
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hahah lmao
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thats techi
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> how did u make it?
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> it has some rules to generate valid nonsensical JS and then just takes out some chars
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh wow self generated
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> cool
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> did you generate it using paint splashes?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> maybe i could tune down the size of the snippet to something actually solvable but that would be less impressive ^^
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> wut?
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ^
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont htink they can see mentions
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @timakro that js solver was used the entry exam script on hackmud right?
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> those were fun times
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont play it anymore tho, but cool game, its a mmo sandbox with js scripting
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/868237522801660035/unknown.png
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> scroll up to ryos article
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> hahaha
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> awesome
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> So generating valid perl would be just take a random ascii string and ask perl if it's valid, if not repeat xD
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> they?
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> wut?
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> (@Ryozuki)
