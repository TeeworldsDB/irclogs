00:00 < bridge_> <aegisub> client mod to replace `rust` in all messages
00:01 < bridge_> <louis> so funny and quirky
00:04 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> https://tenor.com/view/principal-skinner-yes-seymour-skinner-the-simpsons-enthusiastic-yes-gif-15806751
00:45 < bridge_> <Solly> boo
00:45 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> no you
00:45 < bridge_> <Solly> AH!
00:45 < bridge_> <Solly> dont scare me like that
01:35 < bridge_> <zhn> ye, but still its kinda strange for me
02:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat nice! I was actually aiming for that. It was on my bucket list to manage to do that once on github.
02:44 < bridge_> <zhn> 🦫
04:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1732504370.png
04:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bash is so flexible
05:16 < bridge_> <Solly> nonono thats a thing in bash?
05:16 < bridge_> <Solly> its a command?
05:49 < bridge_> <soulyvevo> @jupeyy_keks have you found what causes https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9228 to happen?
09:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Solly i implemented defer my self using ``eval`` and ``trap`` you dont wanna see the code. But I think it is neat that bash can implemnt such syntax you can even do named arguments if you want to.
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> `eval` is such a powerful tool
09:30 < bridge_> <woidless> ChillerDragon
09:30 < bridge_> <woidless> Is it possible to make a Python script that can log on to my server and send a certain message to the chat?
09:31 < bridge_> <woidless> Exactly so that I can run this script on my phone or on my PC
09:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat i struggel with the conventional commit messages. I feel like I use "chore" way too much. But many things i do are neither refactors, fixes or features. Also not sure if I should use "doc" or "docs".
09:31 < bridge_> <meloƞ> Fifo
09:31 < bridge_> <meloƞ> econ
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The word "feat" sounds so strong as if it claims to be a core feature of the project. Something a user of the software would notice and look for in the commit log. So if it is a tw network library a feature should implement parts of the protocol and not just tweak the cmake file to unlock some build feature.
09:33 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: I try to follow https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
09:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Is a typo in a commit really relevant enough to earn the "fix" badge?
09:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea i red that still not too sure about it
09:33 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> or slap `chore` and call it a day
09:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i never used ``BREAKING CHANGE:`` only ``feat!:``
09:33 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> Same
09:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i actually use conventional commits in twnet_parser and i automatically generate changelogs and the release script also automatically bumps to the correct next semver based on the conventional commits
09:34 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> > a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, OR appends a ! after the type/scope
09:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and i check the conventional commit in the CI
09:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but after all this time it still feels weird
09:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > The type fix MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.
09:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fixing a typo in a comment is not a bug fix in the application
09:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lmao he is deranged
09:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless there is also announcements.txt which sends a list of messages to the chat there is no need to use a script for that
09:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you want to chat from your phone i recommend to open a econ port on your server
09:50 < bridge_> <woidless> What I want is a Python script that kind of creates a bot that can log on to the server and perform any action
09:52 < bridge_> <kollpotato> :wtf:
09:53 < bridge_> <kollpotato> just write a library which connects to ddnet servers
09:53 < bridge_> <kollpotato> chiller has one but in ruby
10:04 < bridge_> <woidless> Is it fashionable to watch?
10:04 < bridge_> <woidless> Can I see it?

10:26 < bridge_> <meloƞ> Are we really supposed to debug AI code in #developer @woidless ?
10:28 < bridge_> <woidless> What does it matter about the origin of this script? I asked if he was normal
10:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> holy shit
10:28 < bridge_> <Solly> ^ this is how voldermort spam bots work x-x
10:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why is chiller even helping this guy
10:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he is just asking for free work
10:29 < bridge_> <Solly> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
10:30 < bridge_> <kollpotato> a good person doesn't belong in the cruel world
10:31 < bridge_> <meloƞ> meh it's up to chiller, if he wants to spend his time helping Evelyn it's obviously his ""problem"", but I'm not sure about asking for help on AI generated code :(
10:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if its only chiller, can u move this to dms
10:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh he is not in discord
10:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> welp
10:32 < bridge_> <teero777> Go matrix dms
10:32 < bridge_> <meloƞ> Evelyn zillyhuhn when
10:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> move it to matrix
10:32 < bridge_> <kollpotato> yea
10:32 < bridge_> <teero777> sillychicken
10:33 < bridge_> <kollpotato> i'm checking this channel for some epic dev stuff but i only see evelyn asking chiller for help
10:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dev channel for devs pls
10:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not "i have a idea guys"
10:35 < bridge_> <meloƞ> Hey Ehm so for a school project you know, like my teacher asked for it.. Ehm can you give me code on how to avoid freeze on my tee character? You know I want to make game accessible for people that are disabled, so Ehm.. yeah If you could help that would be awesome! Best regards

10:36 < bridge_> <woidless> I've been mentioned more times than I asked for lol
11:08 < bridge_> <♂S1mple♂> Nah, asking people to debug ai generated code for free is crazy
11:09 < bridge_> <Assa> Does anyone know, if and where a map stores the version of the client it's created with?
11:22 < bridge_> <Assa> checked the map-directory with twmap, and the files only contained
11:22 < bridge_> <Assa> ```
11:22 < bridge_> <Assa> {
11:22 < bridge_> <Assa>   "type": "ddnet06",
11:22 < bridge_> <Assa>   "created_by": "twmap 0.12.4"
11:22 < bridge_> <Assa> }
11:22 < bridge_> <Assa> ```
11:22 < bridge_> <Assa> So I guess the info i am searching for is simply not there
11:23 < bridge_> <Assa> So there is no way to know by what client version a map was created by 😦
11:24 < bridge_> <kollpotato> why would you want that
11:24 < bridge_> <kollpotato> :thonk:
11:25 < bridge_> <Assa> imagine all older versions have a bug so you can check against this
11:25 < bridge_> <kollpotato> epic
11:25 < bridge_> <Assa> why wouldn't you want that, this is reproducability
11:25 < bridge_> <Assa> I am a scientist and I want to reliably reproduce my editor experiments
11:25 < bridge_> <Assa> I am a scientist and I want to reliably reproduce my editor experiments /s
11:27 < bridge_> <Assa> please at least contain a date, I think i have to go with the file date instead
11:32 < bridge_> <murpi> At the point of this event: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/f27be0537175ee8053183ccc77a9d00a21c9e0c4/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1612, does the server already know the player's name?
11:36 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i would say yes
11:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or wait
11:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe not
11:38 < bridge_> <murpi> it's a bit annoying having to use grep -A1 or grep -B1 just to figure out the client ID, address, or player name. It would be much better if "player" in the server log line was replaced with the actual player name, so everything could be found in one line (and it would be easier to regex as well).
11:38 < bridge_> <murpi> ```
11:38 < bridge_> <murpi> 2024-11-25 06:54:32 I server: User has entered the game. ClientId=ID addr=<{...}> sixup=0
11:38 < bridge_> <murpi> 2024-11-25 06:54:32 I chat: *** 'User' entered and joined the game
11:38 < bridge_> <murpi> ```
11:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/f27be0537175ee8053183ccc77a9d00a21c9e0c4/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1581
11:40 < bridge_> <woidless> Please respond
11:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no
11:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> try "ripgrep"
11:40 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but yeah
11:42 < bridge_> <murpi> Does this even work with 0.6?
11:42 < bridge_> <♂S1mple♂> It's crazy how you avoid doing anything yourself
11:43 < bridge_> <woidless> At least if this script works, then in fact I didn't ask anyone here to do it.
11:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> he would make a fine CEO kek
11:44 < bridge_> <meloƞ> No you asked AI and instead of testing it yourself you asked us if it's "normal" which implies you want US to test YOUR script that you got from AI :monkaStop:
11:44 < bridge_> <meloƞ> At this point just pay someone to do it :NotLikeKogasa:
11:45 < bridge_> <murpi> This seems part of chillers https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds_network library made for 0.7 ^^
11:45 < bridge_> <murpi> (hence my question whether this even works for 0.6)
11:45 < bridge_> <woidless> I just want you to tell me if this code can work at all
11:46 < bridge_> <♂S1mple♂> Put it in the game and see yourself
11:46 < bridge_> <♂S1mple♂> Bruh
11:46 < bridge_> <woidless> Please advise IDLE for Ruby
11:48 < bridge_> <murpi> If this is just a chatbot that works only for 0.7, you could probably rewrite something similar that simply reads the server chat log and sends responses through the input FIFO xd @ryozuki Didn't do something similar?
11:48 < bridge_> <murpi> If this is just a chatbot that works only for 0.7, you could probably rewrite something similar that simply reads the server chat log and sends responses through the input FIFO xd @ryozuki Didn't you do something similar?
11:49 < bridge_> <woidless> I want to make a script like a bot that can log on to any server and execute any command, such as a chat message
11:49 < bridge_> <♂S1mple♂> Why it should be a bot in the first place
11:51 < bridge_> <woidless> Because a person will not be able to do 1 action indefinitely
11:52 < bridge_> <teero777> Ok you are basically asking for the same thing those spam advertising bots are doing
11:52 < bridge_> <cyberfrighter> lmao
11:53 < bridge_> <woidless> I'm not going to do any advertising.
11:54 < bridge_> <Assa> What is your goal?
11:56 < bridge_> <woidless> You can say it like dummy
12:06 < bridge_> <Solly> add google search engine for free funding
12:06 < bridge_> <Solly> x-x
12:07 < bridge_> <Solly> `https://ddnet.org/funding/` wait this is sorta an account system
12:07 < bridge_> <Solly> if you ahve ur ign in here, and have a paypal reciet u can prov e its you x-x
12:09 < bridge_> <zhn> спасибо @cattide

12:30 < bridge_> <cyberfrighter> spasibo to you too
12:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i tried this and its kindas nice https://umami.is/
12:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its like a tracker for webs but it doesnt store personal info and self hosted
12:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> gdpr compliant
12:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://umami.is/docs/faq
12:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> stats for my web https://umami.edgl.dev/share/w1sajj3n8O0hfZnD/edgl.dev
12:50 < bridge_> <kollpotato> afaik 0.7 clients can connect to ddnet 0.6 servers but not to vanilla 0.6 servers
12:57 < bridge_> <jxsl13> is censorlist.txt simple string matching?
13:04 < bridge_> <BratOK> Всегда пожалуйста!
13:10 < bridge_> <kollpotato> i doubt that now
13:10 < bridge_> <kollpotato> > While being fully teeworlds compatible ddnet added its own extensions. Meaning vanilla 0.6 teeworlds clients can join ddnet servers and ddnet clients can join 0.6 vanilla teeworlds servers.
13:11 < bridge_> <kollpotato> from the chiller's protocol documentation
13:11 < bridge_> <kollpotato> 0.7 servers are almost non existent
13:13 < bridge_> <kollpotato> maybe that library was chiller's attempt to revive it
13:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupstar are you still around?
13:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @murpi my lib can only connect to 0.7 servers so no it does not work for 0.6 but that should be fine. ddnet servers accept 0.7 connections so unless you are running some ancient server it should be all smooth.
13:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 yes
13:32 < bridge_> <woidless> ChillerDragon
13:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gtg
13:33 < bridge_> <woidless> In theory, can this script work?
13:33 < bridge_> <kollpotato> oh they do accept 0.7 connections
13:33 < bridge_> <kollpotato> epic
13:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in theory everything produced by chatgpt can be hallucinated in practice everything that is in my official example from the readme just straight up works thats all the time i have right now
13:35 < bridge_> <woidless> I'll read it now
13:36 < bridge_> <woidless> ```require_relative 'lib/teeworlds_client'
13:36 < bridge_> <woidless> 
13:36 < bridge_> <woidless> client = TeeworldsClient.new(verbose: false)
13:36 < bridge_> <woidless> 
13:36 < bridge_> <woidless> client.on_chat do |_, msg|
13:36 < bridge_> <woidless>   # note use `next` instead of `return` in the block
13:36 < bridge_> <woidless>   next unless msg.message[0] == '!'
13:36 < bridge_> <woidless> 
13:36 < bridge_> <woidless>   case msg.message[1..]
13:36 < bridge_> <woidless>   when 'ping' then client.send_chat('pong')
13:36 < bridge_> <woidless>   when 'whoami' then client.send_chat("You are: #{msg.author.name}")
13:37 < bridge_> <woidless>   when 'list' then client.send_chat(client.game_client.players.values.map(&:name).join(', '))
13:37 < bridge_> <woidless>   else client.send_chat('Unknown command! Commands: !ping, !whoami, !list')
13:37 < bridge_> <woidless>   end
13:37 < bridge_> <woidless> end
13:37 < bridge_> <woidless> 
13:37 < bridge_> <woidless> # properly disconnect on ctrl+c
13:37 < bridge_> <woidless> Signal.trap('INT') do
13:37 < bridge_> <woidless>   client.disconnect
13:37 < bridge_> <woidless> end
13:37 < bridge_> <woidless> 
13:37 < bridge_> <woidless> # connect to localhost and block the current thread
13:37 < bridge_> <woidless> client.connect('localhost', 8303, detach: false) ```
13:37 < bridge_> <woidless> If I specify my IP address and the desired port here, will it work?
13:38 < bridge_> <kollpotato> idk test it yourself
13:46 < bridge_> <jxsl13> 😢 no regex
14:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless you need a maps7/ directory next to your maps/ directory on your server with the same map names for 0.7 otherwise your server shuts off the 0.7 bridge
14:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @murpi yes the client sends startinfo before entergame so in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/f27be0537175ee8053183ccc77a9d00a21c9e0c4/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1612
14:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the server already got https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/game_messages.html#NETMSGTYPE_CL_STARTINFO
14:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and it is indeed a common log parsing pain which requires state
14:34 < bridge_> <murpi> chillerdragon: :poggers2: when qol pr?
14:35 < bridge_> <kollpotato> redesign ddnet protocol when :poggers2:
14:35 < bridge_> <kollpotato> idk why but why not
14:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki the ready message is actually sent before the player sends its name
14:35 < bridge_> <murpi> qol changes > everything else
14:35 < bridge_> <kollpotato> the only weird thing in protocol imo is that there are 3 types of messages
14:36 < bridge_> <murpi> when colors in rcon console
14:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @murpi yeah sounds good dont forget to ping @jxsl13 in the pr
14:36 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> connless, system, game
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is that the order? @fokkonaut 
14:37 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> i think?
14:37 < bridge_> <kollpotato> what about control xd
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nah
14:37 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Ah you mean those
14:37 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Yea
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> connless is only for master stuff so its optional in the connection process
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sys and game are mixed in order
14:37 < bridge_> <kollpotato> oh
14:38 < bridge_> <kollpotato> so there is a reason for that?
14:38 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Definitely
14:38 < bridge_> <kollpotato> i thought it was just a random decision xd
14:38 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> connless is for when you're not connected to the server
14:38 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> control starts when you have a slot already on the server
14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> those are the message sent by ddnet server and client up until the code line murpi linked and highlighted in blue is the player name message
14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1732541878.png
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the second highlight -.-
14:39 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> then some handshake takes place, player gets inserted, system messages start, info, map, etc. then after the connection is established, the client sends it's own info like playername and skin (in game context already, but still a system msg).
14:39 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Then, the client is ready to enter the game
14:39 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> and game messages start
14:39 < bridge_> <jxsl13> I was pinged, log parsing mentioned?
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
14:39 < bridge_> <jxsl13> 👀
14:39 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> and as chiller said, system and game messages can be mixed, so while ingame you can receive specific system msgs aswell
14:41 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> @kollpotato control messages are also used when you want to disconnect. The server will tell you to drop using Control messages aswell
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless btw i also got a python library for clients but imo the ruby one is way easier to use
14:41 < bridge_> <kollpotato> no system messages are sent after game messages?
14:41 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> ^
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kollpotato look at the screenshot alone
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> game startinfo is sent before sys enter game
14:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and inputs are also system messages they are sent all the time
14:42 < bridge_> <kollpotato> yeah i see now
14:42 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> For example, rcon is a system message. It's from the deeper engine server code.
14:42 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> 
14:42 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> Game messages usually mean from the game context itself.
14:42 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> inputs are also handled on the engine level at first
14:42 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> then redirected to the game context
14:42 < bridge_> <kollpotato> thanks for telling me this epic network stuff
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea the game vs system is really about where they are in the code
14:43 < bridge_> <kollpotato> i luv u @fokkonaut and ChillerDragon
14:43 < bridge_> <fokkonaut> you're welcome
14:43 < bridge_> <kollpotato> :brownbear:
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when was this star particle effect added to ddnet? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1732542500.png
14:49 < bridge_> <louis> ChillerDragon: for /invincible command
14:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i did not get a notification from my mod relevant label bot
14:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks btw @louis 
14:59 < bridge_> <woidless> Can you give it to me?
15:00 < bridge_> <zhn> bros about to spam all servers on master smh
15:00 < bridge_> <woidless> I have a ruby interpreter that does not want to be installed
15:00 < bridge_> <woidless> Нет
15:01 < bridge_> <woidless> No, I'm going to use it as a "dummy"
15:01 < bridge_> <zhn> dummy for what
15:01 < bridge_> <woidless> For example, implement the settings on YOUR server....
15:39 < bridge_> <zhn> tf ur talking about
15:54 < bridge_> <meloƞ> You want to remotely access multiple servers to execute rcon commands? :thisemoji:
15:54 < bridge_> <meloƞ> Use a discord bot/econ
16:01 < bridge_> <teero777> Hiiii chiller
16:01 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> use discord bot + bash file + fifo file to do what you want or remove discord and use directly execute bash to execute rcon commands on your servers fifo file
16:01 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> Senpai what distro are you using ?
16:02 < bridge_> <woidless> I want to create a bot that can send messages in chat and perform any action in the game
16:03 < bridge_> <teero777> Only on your own servers?
16:03 < bridge_> <woidless> ye
16:03 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> are you using linux or trash ?
16:04 < bridge_> <woidless> ubuntu
16:04 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> nice
16:05 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> then you can create your discord bot with any language you want implement to send your command to fifo file of your server
16:06 < bridge_> <teero777> Then code your bot in the ddnet src instead of using external stuff
16:06 < bridge_> <meloƞ> the only real one
16:06 < bridge_> <meloƞ> NixOS
16:06 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> ```bash
16:06 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> #!/usr/bin/env zsh
16:06 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> message="test text to broadcast and say"
16:06 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> echo "broadcast \"$message\"; say \"$message\"" > /home/Vexar/DDNet/8303.fifo
16:06 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> ```
16:06 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> example of using fifo to broadcast and say
16:07 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> it's on bash file you can do directly by your bot
16:07 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> is it arch base or debian ?
16:07 < bridge_> <meloƞ> arch.. debian..
16:07 < bridge_> <meloƞ> you make me sick!
16:08 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> 😄
16:08 < bridge_> <meloƞ> NixOS is it's own distinct distro, own package manager and sysmte configuration approach
16:08 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> oh
16:08 < bridge_> <meloƞ> it's fully declarative
16:08 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> nice
16:08 < bridge_> <woidless> I don't want to use discord bots, because you can connect a bot directly through the teeworlds network, as well as scripts to my liking. I'm waiting for a response from ChillerDragon about python teeworlds network
16:08 < bridge_> <meloƞ> NixOS is it's own distinct distro, own package manager and system configuration approach
16:08 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> hmm
16:09 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> then we are stop talking until you get response from Chilly Dragon
16:10 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> and another question what's your recommendation for desktop manager, gnome or plasma ?
16:10 < bridge_> <meloƞ> neither, i3
16:10 < bridge_> <meloƞ> imagine needing a Desktop environment
16:10 < bridge_> <meloƞ> couldnt be me
16:11 < bridge_> <meloƞ> but i'm on sway rn, to be fair - but given it's a drop in replacement for i3 i didnt really notice any difference
16:11 < bridge_> <meloƞ> just that i need to run xwayland now
16:11 < bridge_> <meloƞ> ..for DDNet to launch..
16:11 < bridge_> <learath2> If you want to make it even more annoying for yourself bspwm is very minimal
16:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i3
16:13 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> no I like i3 more than anything in past I used i3 and that was really cool for programming and even multimedia usage
16:14 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> okey then "NixOS I3", I'm coming for you 😉
16:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> gentoo pls
16:15 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> no please
16:15 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> that'
16:15 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> that's not for me right now
16:15 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> gentoo is on next level
16:16 < bridge_> <teero777> i3 is good
16:17 < bridge_> <teero777> ey are there any good alternatives to picom on corgi?
16:17 < bridge_> <teero777> *xorg
16:17 < bridge_> <teero777> ey are there any good alternatives to picom on xorg
16:18 < bridge_> <teero777> ey are there any good alternatives to picom on xorg?
16:22 < bridge_> <meloƞ> mate, nixos is harder to get used to than gentoo
16:23 < bridge_> <meloƞ> gentoo is a one time setup
16:23 < bridge_> <meloƞ> 
16:23 < bridge_> <meloƞ> nixos is `FULLY FULLY FULLY` declarative, you need to learn the language: `nix`
16:23 < bridge_> <meloƞ> 
16:23 < bridge_> <meloƞ> need to learn how to setup your `SYSTEM` with `nix` etc
16:23 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> that sound like challenge hmm
16:23 < bridge_> <meloƞ> do it like @b0th - setup nix in a VM, get used to it, and then do the switch
16:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr do u use nix with native march
16:24 < bridge_> <meloƞ> or even better, just use nix right now! the package manager works outside of the distribution
16:24 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> True story, but i was using nix for a long time before 😄
16:24 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> then maybe I should stay as trash user
16:24 < bridge_> <meloƞ> the compiler flag? :kek:
16:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yeah
16:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> compile with native cpu features
16:25 < bridge_> <meloƞ> nah i didnt bother
16:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ofc u didnt
16:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i tried back then
16:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it was awful
16:25 < bridge_> <meloƞ> :KEKW:
16:25 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> What is the point to use gentoo ?
16:25 < bridge_> <meloƞ> absolute control
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with gentoo u have absolute control indeed
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for example say there is package X and it has a list of optional dependencies and features
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u can select to enable or disable them
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> you also can compile the packages using ur native cpu feature set
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> distros use x85_64 v0
16:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i use v4
16:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> distros use x86_64 v0
16:27 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Interesting
16:27 < bridge_> <meloƞ> a few things like `deselecting deps` can be done on nix aswell
16:27 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> But now ill never leave nixos
16:27 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Yes i was about to say it xd

16:28 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> you guys like living with linux and even sleeping with your os at night, I just compile some sources or maybe playing some games
16:28 < bridge_> <meloƞ> :kek: - Ryozuki is a Gentoo chad
16:28 < bridge_> <meloƞ> 
16:28 < bridge_> <meloƞ> me and nagi live in the nix world
16:28 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> then I don't thing Nix or Gentoo is good for me
16:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i also play some games
16:28 < bridge_> <meloƞ> they're basically nerdy distros, not really useful for people who just want stuff to work out of the box
16:28 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> Ryo are defender of Rust and Gentoo community 😄
16:29 < bridge_> <meloƞ> hey i also code in rust
16:29 < bridge_> <meloƞ> hey i also code in rust™️
16:29 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> most of games isn't fully support on linux yet
16:29 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Nix(OS) requires a lot of investment is you want to make cool thing but you can totally write a simple configuration
16:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> false
16:29 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> yeah but not like ryo
16:29 < bridge_> <learath2> Gentoo ❤️
16:29 < bridge_> <meloƞ> i know a single brand that doesn't work on any linux kernel/distro

16:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ddnet is a linux first game
16:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u get more support on linux than windows
16:30 < bridge_> <learath2> I still keep a windows install mostly for riot games games
16:30 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> with your gif it's hard to denied that I love to use gentoo or nix 😄
16:30 < bridge_> <meloƞ> Ryo what's the highest FPS you tickled out of DDNet?
16:30 < bridge_> <meloƞ> i peaked at 23K
16:30 < bridge_> <meloƞ> the coil whine was crazy.. poor thing
16:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> how u peak that high
16:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur pc is same as mine nearly
16:31 < bridge_> <meloƞ> different GPU
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk it shows always the same fps no matter what i do
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 5k
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i have a 3080
16:31 < bridge_> <meloƞ> you're on nvidia arent you?
16:31 < bridge_> <meloƞ> amd masterrace
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i use a amd cpu
16:31 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> well I have to use dual boot for my systems I can't fully uninstall windows for now

16:32 < bridge_> <meloƞ> how you got 0.07 gb more RAM >:c ... shitgame
16:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u know why my uptime is 27 mins?
16:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 27 mins ago i typed pkill xinit by mistake
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :KEKW:
16:33 < bridge_> <meloƞ> :pepeW:  how does one... accidentally type that
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wanted to pkill xivlauncher
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :MonkaChrist:

16:33 < bridge_> <meloƞ> i forgot i had the default keybind to pkill -f sway setup once
16:33 < bridge_> <meloƞ> 
16:33 < bridge_> <meloƞ> accidentally shutdown my WM in a 2 1/2 h run on DDNet :)
16:34 < bridge_> <meloƞ> big L - client's dont even support 64p
16:34 < bridge_> <meloƞ> big L - client's dont even support 64+p
16:34 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> they can connect to server but it's broken on clients
16:34 < bridge_> <montikboom> i already started server with it
16:34 < bridge_> <montikboom> everything fine
16:34 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> so in total it's broken
16:34 < bridge_> <montikboom> also can i get it to 2000+ players?
16:34 < bridge_> <meloƞ> you set up a server with 134 dead slots
16:34 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> try to connect some debug dummy and check scoreboard and etc
16:35 < bridge_> <meloƞ> you set up a server with 136 dead slots
16:35 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> I can do it with infinite slots, but not working on ddnet's network base caclculation for rendering tee and etc
16:36 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> maybe juppy could do it easily on his Rust version of server but on c++ it's working like shit
16:36 < bridge_> <montikboom> is ddnet++ have bugs more than working things?
16:38 < bridge_> <learath2> There is a possibility that he used fokkonauts patch but upped it to 200
16:38 < bridge_> <meloƞ> @b0th ofborg being annoying again gg
16:38 < bridge_> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1310630755897970810/image.png?ex=6745eb82&is=67449a02&hm=28418e458604954261bde7af9e8aadb74c2a1142d90d67d55f9eae335f6fd043&
16:40 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> that patch has completely done ?
16:41 < bridge_> <learath2> It's mostly fine except for a few bugs
16:41 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> then it's still need more work to do
16:42 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> have redesign for scoreboard too ?
16:42 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> to show more than 64 clients
16:42 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> Tf, i thought you already reviewed this xd
16:42 < bridge_> <meloƞ> i did -.-
16:43 < bridge_> <learath2> I think robyt3 had one
16:43 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> nice
16:50 < bridge_> <meloƞ> upstream teeworlds had a `scrolling scoreboard` - which was implemented meh, but the idea was good
16:50 < bridge_> <meloƞ> upstream teeworlds had a `scrolling scoreboard` PR - which was implemented meh, but the idea was good
16:54 < bridge_> <robyt3> The scoreboard already supports 128 players. But more seems unrealistic without either cutting some info like clans and country flags or making it scrollable (which would be less convenient to use and requires more work if you want to make it a proper UI)
16:55 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> i dont know why we need to show every player ever if theres gonna be so many people
16:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1310635047316885576/348862845-30b3321f-8b9f-4e32-9c1b-28a275678ef6.png?ex=6745ef81&is=67449e01&hm=d10f77db9323758b00a27c5514468f355ba3976027be3e77113a91b561f40803&
16:56 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> why not just like, the top 10 and then where you are, surrounded by a few close ranks if there are any
16:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://xkcd.com/3015/
17:03 < bridge_> <robyt3> I'm not sure if players wouldn't find this confusing because they expect that all players can also be found in the scoreboard. Though I think with the 128 backwards compatiblity that would already be the default behavior (only players close to each other are sent to each other to get around the 64 player limit).
17:04 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> So why
17:04 < bridge_> <meloƞ> no idea >:c
17:14 < bridge_> <Ewan> they are p good for me
17:16 < bridge_> <murpi> @blaiszephyr Imagine moderating this
17:16 < bridge_> <murpi> This will be your future :greenthing:
17:16 < bridge_> <meloƞ> 250 ecto's monthly ...
17:17 < bridge_> <meloƞ> guys one of those nameless tee is hacking
17:17 < bridge_> <meloƞ> 
17:17 < bridge_> <meloƞ> WHICH OF THE 3923 PLAYING RIGHT NOW?
17:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> use GNOME if you want to use computer without headache
17:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> use KDE if you also want to game
17:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> use a tiling WM if you want to rice which it sounds like u dont
17:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> u can rice ur stacking wm but unixporn will call u mean names
17:18 < bridge_> <murpi> Ohoho, no, imagine them having cyrllic names. You really think you have the luxury to simply type out their name?
17:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> lmfao
17:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> definitely a unique challenge
17:19 < bridge_> <woidless> Maybe someone has a link to the github teeworld network written in python?
17:19 < bridge_> <meloƞ> :monkaStop:
17:19 < bridge_> <diariesvexar> thank you ❤️
17:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> do you mean a server
17:19 < bridge_> <Ewan> i have no idea about it
17:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> u should be able to spec and get ur cursor out to click somebody and just ban them tbh
17:20 < bridge_> <Ewan> one day
17:21 < bridge_> <woidless> That's what I mean.
17:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> python client
17:22 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh no
17:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://chipsandcheese.com/p/pushing-amds-infinity-fabric-to-its
17:24 < bridge_> <robyt3> I think we have an issue for supporting chat autocompletion of names with transliteration, but we'd have to find a library to do that
17:27 < bridge_> <murpi> Scoreboard overhaul! Integrate it into the ESC menu, allowing ppl to clickily click on names to either copy or spectate them!
17:28 < bridge_> <robyt3> Yeah, if we make the scoreboard scrollable it would be like in CSGO/CS2 where you can bring up a cursor and right-click players to open a context menu to mute, report etc.
17:29 < bridge_> <murpi> Or that 😄

17:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> rustup toolchain install stable
17:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> oh yeah u did
17:47 < bridge_> <robyt3> Try to run `rustc` and `cargo`. Both should print something instead of "Could not find rustc/cargo", otherwise you either didn't install them correctly or you have to add them to your `PATH` variable manually
17:47 < bridge_> <terrachess> rustc and cargo works and asks for a command
17:48 < bridge_> <Ewan> say `which cargo`
17:48 < bridge_> <terrachess> /home/lio/.cargo/bin/cargo
17:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> do you use a different shell to build
17:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> or an IDE or smth
17:49 < bridge_> <terrachess> im using vscodium bruh
17:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> ok bruh
17:50 < bridge_> <Ewan> open a terminal in there and if cargo not found then you need to add it to your config, perhaps in your workspace
17:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> if in your shell where you call cargo & it succeeds, and the following command(s) also succeed, you just need your PATH to be updated within your ide
17:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> `cmake -B build -S && cmake --build build`
17:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> that's roughly analagous to the run button in vscode
17:53 < bridge_> <Ewan> i get around this problem entirely by using `direnv` + the vscode extension, which lets me define `env`ironment variables & much more (it integrates with another config file inside my per-project repos which tells it what packages are needed for development in this `dir`, among other things)
17:54 < bridge_> <terrachess> it worked but /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so', needed by 'DDNet'

18:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`
18:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> looks a little suspicious to me, i don't think arch will typically use a nested tuple dir like this for the native architecture
18:00 < bridge_> <Ewan> but idk what crystal linux is or what it does
18:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> but i actually dont know where that is coming from either, supposedly pkg-config is providing .pc files which point to that directory, but if the library doesn't exist then that's just wrong

18:01 < bridge_> <terrachess> uhm
18:02 < bridge_> <terrachess> i havent a x86-linux-gnu folder
18:02 < bridge_> <terrachess> wait what

18:02 < bridge_> <terrachess> that's all
18:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> in your /usr/lib??
18:02 < bridge_> <terrachess> yes
18:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> how are u talking to me rn
18:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> ur pc should be shitting itself
18:02 < bridge_> <terrachess> xd wtf
18:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> ok do like which sh
18:02 < bridge_> <Ewan> tell me what that say
18:02 < bridge_> <terrachess> i think i should install clear arch
18:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> im unsure about that
18:03 < bridge_> <terrachess> it will work better
18:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> i used clear linux for a while, which is a great distro but not really for devs
18:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> but idk what clear arch is
18:03 < bridge_> <terrachess> just arch
18:03 < bridge_> <terrachess> dont archbased
18:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> oic
18:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> u want to uninstall
18:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> actually it'd be good if you used nix. then you'd be unstoppable. use nixos at that point tho :D
18:04 < bridge_> <terrachess> i like nixos's logo bruh
18:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> i hate to be such a shill but most of my packaging issues for development have been completely solved (which historically has been a big reason behind my initial switch to linux then between distros)
18:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's kinda brainy and weird but if u want a new distro then it's worth a shot
18:05 < bridge_> <terrachess> thanks
18:15 < bridge_> <meloƞ> nixos is great if you learn it's lanugage
18:15 < bridge_> <meloƞ> nixos is great if you learn it's language
18:15 < bridge_> <meloƞ> you can have it minimal and functional like any other distro
18:15 < bridge_> <meloƞ> or you can fiddle around with it and create greatness
18:17 < bridge_> <Ewan> ye
18:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> u can do like i did and go into it with very little prior knowledge
18:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> and just write terrible configs until you realize they are terrible and then u have to fix them
18:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> but it saves u having to read things
18:18 < bridge_> <Ewan> i wouldnt recommend it
18:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @montikboom which bug did you find in ddnet++?
18:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless the python library is still quite low level and has no documentation yet there is only this quite complicated example available https://gitlab.com/teeworlds-network/twnet_parser/-/tree/master/examples/07/download_map?ref_type=heads
18:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> unless you need python because of some discord dependency i would highly recommend getting ruby to work which should be way smoother as of right now
18:51 < bridge_> <pilonpl> why does my firewall somehow prevent ddnet from seeing a local server hosted on the same machine?
18:52 < bridge_> <pilonpl> i am pretty sure other servers work just fine without any special firewall rules
18:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> depends on the firewall
18:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> many have application specific rules which don't act on ports, they act on binaries
18:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> if your thing was once allowed through by its binary location you'll have to re-do that for the new binary, or just open the port
18:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> local server should be visible regardless with or without firewall so i suspect other issues
18:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> firewall controls incoming and outbound packets but those should never be leaving your computer
18:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> firewall controls incoming and outbound connections but those should never be leaving your computer
18:55 < bridge_> <Ewan> firewall controls incoming and outbound connections but none have to leave your computer in order to be visible on ddnet
18:55 < bridge_> <pilonpl> i just use ufw
18:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> i mean
18:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> what are your firewall rules
18:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> lol
18:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> try `ufw allow $port/udp`
18:57 < bridge_> <Ewan> even still should not be related unless you have very restrictive rules either there or in iptables or smth
19:00 < bridge_> <pilonpl> maybe it ddnet doesnt check for servers the loopback interface ~~i have no idea how any of this works exactly~~
19:02 < bridge_> <pilonpl> because the loopback isnt blocked by default
19:02 < bridge_> <pilonpl> and i can still connect
19:03 < bridge_> <pilonpl> its just that ddnet doesnt list the server
19:08 < bridge_> <Ewan> there need not be any loopback device
19:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> if you cannot do like `connect localhost:port` in ddnet f1 console
19:09 < bridge_> <Ewan> then ur server is probably not working
19:28 < bridge_> <Nagi01 {LAN}> it has been merged :PEP_peepoHappy:
