00:00 < xrothx> nice ^^
00:00 < xrothx> indeed
00:00 < xrothx> to log them all
00:05 < xrothx> pff..
00:06 < xrothx> I bought a server @ strsbrg FR. 8gb ram 6vcpu's
00:06 < xrothx> But the webinterface sucked so now I have to find new php coder ^^^
00:07 < xrothx> any php coder @ ddnet ? 
00:07 < xrothx> g2g =)
00:07 < xrothx> bb
00:31 <@deen> maybe the tutorial should just be hardcoded into ddnet client, and be played offline. so when you start the client for the first time you get asked if you want to do the tutorial
00:43 < laxa> I think most games do that deen
01:11 < Maple> sup
02:22 < eeeee> but you'd have to spawn a local server
02:22 < eeeee> which would trip firewall/antivirus software in certain operating systems
02:23 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: you could make a virtual server, spawned inside the client
02:23 < eeeee> hmm maybe won't be that bad if you get it to bind to localhost
02:23 < eeeee> dunno how easy would that be
02:23 <@heinrich5991> (transfer happening in-memory)
02:23 <@heinrich5991> not sure either
02:23 < eeeee> just spawning a server in separate process sounds like the easiest way
02:24 <@heinrich5991> yea prolly
12:27 < RafaelFF> Hello there.
12:28 < RafaelFF> I was wondering what specifications and configurations would a official ddnet server require.  Anyone have this information?
12:32 <@deen> root access for me :P
12:32 <@deen> hi RafaelFF 
12:32 <@deen> RafaelFF: where do you want to run one?
12:32 <@deen> If it's Brasil, then I'm very interested
12:33 < RafaelFF> BR, yes.
12:33 <@deen> Debian 7 ideally, need only 1 cpu core, 512 MB RAM, stable VM and stable network
12:33 <@deen> i get access, then i set the server up
12:34 < RafaelFF> Normally one server run a lot of ddnet server instances?
12:34 <@deen> yes
12:35 < RafaelFF> So, for example, I would pay the mothly/anualy fee and you would be the admin
12:35 < RafaelFF> right?
12:36 <@deen> well, i set up the server, but i wouldn't do any administration ingame in brasil
12:36 < RafaelFF> I see.
12:36 <@deen> there isN't much administration to do in ddnet anyway
12:37 < RafaelFF> I see. Once the server is up, just don't touch, right? :D
12:37 <@deen> must of the stuff is automatic then
12:37 < RafaelFF> awesome
12:37 <@deen> like adding new maps, tournaments
12:38 < RafaelFF> And the scores and ranks are synced with all other servers?
12:38 <@deen> yes
12:38 <@deen> same ranks worldwide
12:38 < RafaelFF> But not all them? What the exception here?
12:39 < RafaelFF> what is*
12:39 <@deen> why not all?
12:39 <@deen> yes, all ranks are worldwide on ddnet
12:39 < RafaelFF> oh, sorry. misread "same"
12:39 < RafaelFF> i thought it was "some".
12:39 < RafaelFF> Great
12:40 < RafaelFF> Thanks for the information.  I'll talk to some people about this idea
12:40 <@deen> ok, great
12:40 <@deen> i've seen there are some brasilian players
12:40 <@deen> would be nice to get something going
12:41 <@deen> but hosting is expensive in brasil, i think
12:41 < RafaelFF> And our ping is minimum 150, which is terrible.
12:41 <@deen> minimum ping on brasil servers?
12:41 < RafaelFF> Maybe, I have to check
12:42 <@deen> or current ddnet?
12:42 < RafaelFF> no, the lower ping for brazilians in DDNet servers.
12:42 <@deen> but yeah, our chile server has terrible routing to other countries
12:44 < RafaelFF> I have to verify some values and who would want to contribute to this server. Maybe we can have a server hosted in Brazil for DDNET
12:44 <@deen> =)
12:44 < RafaelFF> Personally, I'd like that.
12:44 < RafaelFF> Dude, can't hammerfly in high ping. Mainly horizontal hammerfly.
12:44 <@deen> yeah, it's terrible
12:44 <@deen> i think for ddnet you need ping < 100
12:45 <@deen> 80 is still ok if you're used to it, everything higher is bad
12:49 < RafaelFF> In our dedicated server (non ddnet) we get 30-90 ping.
13:26 < RafaelFF> deen, related to DDNet server spec, what is the HD prerequisite?
13:32 < RafaelFF> and do you have any information on the estimative of limit of traffic?
13:40 <@deen> RafaelFF: HD should be about 5 GB
13:41 <@deen> traffic really depends on how many players you get
13:41 <@deen> Chile is pretty full and gets 600 GB / month
13:44 < RafaelFF> awesome.
13:45 < RafaelFF> Our virtual private server have 3 instances of TW running: ctf, dm and Tw+ (ictf, gctf, etc.)... Any problem having these in the server as DDNet instances?
13:49 <@deen> no, i just need your configs and i can keep them running
13:50 < RafaelFF> what configs?
13:50 <@deen> server configs, so i can keep running them
13:50 <@deen> maybe i misunderstood the question
13:53 < RafaelFF> well, my idea was to keep them separated to avoid our ctf/etc. messing with ddnet server. possible?
13:53 < RafaelFF> or not a good idea?
14:00 <@deen> ah
14:00 <@deen> how "separated"?
14:00 <@deen> on another server? or just as a separate user?
14:00 <@deen> both are fine with me
14:01 < RafaelFF> I was thinking about different configs files or different folders...
14:01 <@deen> yeah, that's fine
14:01 < RafaelFF> but this is just an idea. I don't have experience in maintaining TW servers. If you say that's the best idea, fine
14:02 <@deen> i can run vanilla and tw+ servers as well, whatever you want
14:03 < RafaelFF> more importantly, i want to avoid someone from messing with the ddnet configs, considering that it is all automatic.
14:09 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went down!
14:10 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went back online!
14:14 <@deen> yeah, i hate when that happens
15:19 < o_be_one> hi
15:19 < o_be_one> iveu nderstood about CAN, its cause my ddnet client is not up to date so it doesnt appear in ddnet tab
15:48 <@deen> ddnet tab should autoupdate itself
15:51 < Nimda> Arcade 2 by RosenVerkäufer just released on Moderate at 2014-11-14 15:50
15:51 < o_be_one> i havent the "CAN" filter
15:52 < o_be_one> and when i use "CAN" keyword in ddnet tab, it doesnt appear ; but in internet tab it appears
15:52 < o_be_one> i think its just cause i havent updated from some weeks
15:52 < o_be_one> my client is outdated ^^
15:57 <@deen> nope, that should not happen
15:57 <@deen> f1, cl_ddnet_version_server
15:57 <@deen> is that set correctly?
19:08 < o_be_one> im not at home right now, but ill try
19:14 <@deen> apparently this commit causes lags on windows: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/commit/808f889c00a189d957202895a87597c41127d76e
19:21 <@deen> any idea why?
20:15 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
20:16 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
20:20 < eeeee> deen: you mean when you run server on windows then it lags?
20:20 <@deen> eeeee: yes
20:20 <@deen> i can't test it myself because i have no windows
20:20 <@deen> just got the report
20:21 < eeeee> running server on windows is always a bad idea. in this case it seems that you're waiting exactly for the next tick in net_socket_read_wait
20:21 < eeeee> maybe that's too long and windows can't manage to schedule your process back before the tick is over
20:22 <@deen> hm
20:22 <@deen> even if nothing else is running? that would be weird
20:23 < eeeee> windows is weird
20:23 < eeeee> i have windows at home, can check it out later
20:23 <@deen> my thought was that it may be because of 32bit, but i don't see that it would overflow
20:23 <@deen> many use the server to locally test their own maps, so it should work on windows^^
