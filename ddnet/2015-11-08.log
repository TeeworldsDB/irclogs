00:09 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you happen to know how the changelogs are written?
00:10 <@heinrich5991> I collected the necessary information, and now I need to know in which format to use
00:10 <@deen> ?
00:11 <@deen> what changelog?
00:11 <@heinrich5991> http://ddnet.tw/news/ddnet-9.0/
00:11 <@deen> i just write them by hand in the ddnet-web repo etc
00:13 <@heinrich5991> ah, like this? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/blob/master/www/_posts/2015-08-27-ddnet-9.0.markdown
00:13 <@deen> right
00:14 <@deen> Maybe you can also use markdown, but I copy and paste that to the /releases/ page as well
00:17 <@heinrich5991> /downloads/ I guess
00:17 <@deen> right
00:42 <@heinrich5991> deen: suggestions? https://github.com/heinrich5991/ddnet-web/blob/master/www/_posts/2015-11-08-ddnet-9.1.markdown
00:42 <@heinrich5991> (on the general format)
00:49 <@deen> looks good to me
08:48 <@EastByte> So I set up letsencrypt for https://ddnet.tw/ now... only that I wasn't smart enough to request forum.ddnet.tw to be whitelisted aswell...
08:48 <@EastByte> gonna take another two days
08:56 <@deen> cool
08:57 <@EastByte> deen: awesome photos :)
08:57 <@deen> the new ones?
08:57 <@EastByte> yea
08:57 <@deen> thanks
08:57 <@deen> no idea how you saw them that quickly^^
08:57 <@EastByte> rss feed still working
08:58 <@deen> oh yeah, people get notifications for rss feeds
08:58 <@deen> i don't like notifications, they distract me
08:58 <@EastByte> right^^
08:58 <@EastByte> and I often want to be distracted from my work :p
09:01 <@deen> it's pretty much the first time I took photos, never had a camera before
09:04 <@deen> also the first time I had a smartphone, android seems really buggy, but maybe it's just my phone
09:04 <@EastByte> you bought an android smartphone for the trip?
09:05 <@deen> I convinced my little brother to buy a new phone and give me his old one :P
09:05 <@EastByte> oh
09:08 <@deen> the second half of the trip was very different from the first one btw, even if the photos don't show it
09:09 <@deen> flew to a new country every other day and used couchsurfing in every single one instead of hostels
09:09 <@EastByte> wow, couchsurfing
09:14 <@deen> in chile the problem is btw that they just gave us a new server and removed the other one
09:14 <@deen> now I have to get them to install debian on it again and I can set it up from scratch
09:15 <@EastByte> :/
09:17 <@EastByte> I only overheard that the support talked about dns stuff
09:19 < eeeee> android is really buggy. vanilla releases and cyanogen are tolerable because they at least get timely fixes, but manufacturers' and carriers' mods are horrible
09:19 < eeeee> like my phone has a bug in alarm clock app (sometimes when you update alarm time it's not changed in the widget). seriously, how can you screw up an alarm clock app...
09:22 <@EastByte> right, without stock android or cyanogen it's pretty bad
09:22 <@EastByte> I choose my smartphone from the cyanogenmod device list
09:43 <@deen> eeeee: well, i use cyanogen but still buggy for me
10:19 < devnull> die german server werden mit russen Ã¼berflutet
10:20 <@deen> devnull: ?
10:20 <@deen> oh, rus down
10:20 <@deen> ddos it seems
10:52 < eeeee> well, rest assured the branded builds are even worse :D
23:53 <@deen> so are there any plans with steam? anything else happened in the last month?
23:57 <@heinrich5991> deen: plans were cancelled by hi_leute
23:57 <@heinrich5991> essentially
