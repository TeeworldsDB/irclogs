00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> Why is the laser rifle and the shotgun's pickup sound the same?
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | HU> :pepedead:
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ds273if everyone knows that faking is trivial, does that not most fix most of the problems with faking?
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ds273> some people dont like when random people finish in their name and mess up their statistics
01:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.sqlite.org/stricttables.html
01:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sqlite with type checking ^^
02:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Bro accounts has been spoken in this channel so many times, like... Even other people have created proof of concept but has led no where. Just play as henrich5991, I'm sure he wont mind ;) hehe
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> people have played under my name before
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or even behaved really badly
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Thanks \:)
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@n000b)
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Getting more finishes and points from fakers is not too harmful imo.
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Harming reputation through bad behavior is worse. But then there is barely any faker out there that has no obvious giveaways. So the only people that get fooled are casuals that likley never did or never will meet the real player
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> And then also how to decide who is real and who isnâ€™t? Do you want to declare 9/10 players using the name â€žBlueâ€œ as fake?
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> TIL `zoom` has a optional parameter. very convienient c\:
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Added in 15.6 iirc
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyone got an idea why "systemctl start mariadb" times out? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4392
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm trying to get a mariadb server running on github build job for the tests
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see no systemctl in there @deen
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh yeah, I removed it and tried to start mariadb manually now
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Is there a way to ssh into the github job?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let me find it
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nothing official it seems
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, got it working finally
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I misremembered it from somewhere else
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what was the problem?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> with mysqld_safe, but still weird that systemctl was hanging
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know, couldn't find anything relevant with journalctl
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> systemctl start mysql would just hang
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> now just the actual postgres port missing ðŸ™‚
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what was the reason for moving to ubuntu 20.04?
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 18.04 uses old sqlite, which doesn't support window functions
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and we use window functions all over
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do they even come up with these silly questions? If you are using `string_reverse` what is the point of a loop even...

19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Beginner CS classes always boggle my mind
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> I had such question but as recursive function ðŸ˜„
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> you should do strong/weak hook warning backwards
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> like, when you see someone who have strong on you-red above him
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> and if you have strong on him-green above him
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> and i dont like this weak/strong hook warnings because it distracts. you should better do a colourful nickname
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> like red nickname on someone you have weak for
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> and green nickname if you have strong on him
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> also you should do a custom colour, of course...
