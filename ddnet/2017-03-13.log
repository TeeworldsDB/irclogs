00:09 <@deen> heinrich5991: no, but it would work
00:09 <@deen> and is better than unit-testing a game
00:10 <@heinrich5991> we could have a look whether there are other open-source games *with* testing :)
10:35 < necropotame> I'm flooded by this when i run "make"
10:35 < necropotame> <command-line>:0:0: warning: "_FORTIFY_SOURCE" redefined
10:35 < necropotame> <built-in>: note: this is the location of the previous definition
10:55 <@deen> necropotame: probably depends on your C/C++ compiler and installed libs
10:55 <@deen> necropotame: i don't get it
10:56 <@deen> and I don't see FORTIFY_SOURCE in ddnet source code
10:56 < necropotame> In the CMakeLists.txt
10:56 < necropotame> if(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES Clang OR CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES GNU)
10:56 < necropotame>   include(CheckSymbolExists)
10:56 < necropotame>   check_symbol_exists(_FORTIFY_SOURCE "" FORTIFY_SOURCE_DEFINED)
10:56 < necropotame> endif()
10:56 <@deen> ah
10:58 < necropotame> I will not investigate this now. In case, I leave here my g++ version: g++ (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4) 5.4.0 20160609

12:52 < necropotame> I'm implementing the overlay for animated zones. I would like to reuse the code of 0.7 for 3D textures. Someone is against this? It's to "tile" a quad with the same png than the one used for tiles
15:05 < Learath2> necropotame: the lines you showed should fix exactly the problem you describe i dont see how it could happen anyways
16:12 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: can you try a clean build?
16:14 < necropotame> I've cloned ddnet repository, and i'm still getting this
16:14 < necropotame> ^ heinrich5991
16:14 <@heinrich5991> mh, weird
16:16 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: can you pastebin (e.g. https://pastebin.mozilla.org/) your `gcc -dM -E - < /dev/null` ?
16:17 < necropotame> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8981886
16:18 <@heinrich5991> mh, no _FORTIFY_SOURCE
16:19 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: can you also check whether `g++ -dM -E - < /dev/null` contains _FORTIFY_SOURCE or if you add -O3 to either command?
16:21 < necropotame> It works with O3
16:21 < necropotame> I means it's in the list
16:21 < necropotame> #define _FORTIFY_SOURCE 2
16:21 <@heinrich5991> mh
16:22 <@heinrich5991> in both c/c++?
16:25 < necropotame> Yes, same behavior:  _FORTIFY_SOURCE set only with -O3

18:21 < necropotame> Sorry, I've answered you in Github. It works for me :) Thanks
18:22 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: you could merge it then :)

18:43 < necropotame> Ryozuki, is this fit for your portalgun? https://s10.postimg.org/v6l1ew16v/portalgun.png
19:01 < Ryozuki> perfect
19:01 < Ryozuki> <3
19:10 < necropotame> Inlet you place them in the ddnet entities file, is it okay?
19:10 < necropotame> I let*
19:10 < Ryozuki> yeah doing it
19:10 < Ryozuki> thxa lot
19:39 <@Nimda> pr0-move by szyker just released on Race at 2017-03-13 19:33
19:39 < Ryozuki> mm this is weird, i broadcasted a map release, but it didn't showed up, it might be some of these new patches that causes it?
20:13 < necropotame> If you are not using the last version and you are in a race, yes
20:14 < necropotame> See issue #669
20:14 < Ryozuki> im using last released version and was not a race server
20:35 < Learath2> we could require proof of work for votes
20:36 < Learath2> stopping votebotting once and for all
20:36 < Learath2> ofc we would be preventing vanilla people from voting
20:36 < Learath2> but it would save me from insulting vali
20:41 <@heinrich5991> meh
20:42 < Learath2> i was thinking of implementing some kind of proof of work in accounts anyways
20:42 <@heinrich5991> proof of work won't stop it, the cpus are too diverse in power
20:42 < Learath2> ?
20:43 <@heinrich5991> players have too differently powerful machines
20:43 < Learath2> oh true there are people still running win xp :P
20:51 <@EastByte> there are a lot of ways to regulate the voting
20:51 < Learath2> well i'd only allow authenticated people to vote which would end it once and for all
20:52 <@EastByte> and what prevents a bot from authenticating with the server?
20:52 < Learath2> we can ban them en masse
20:53 <@EastByte> I think that would only work out if accounts had some sort of worth
20:53 <@EastByte> like maps finished/playtime
20:53 < Henningstone> If ingame accounts would be tied to forum accounts, that's the only way how you could rather effectively prevent bots from registering
20:53 < Henningstone> but that would be odd as shit ._.
20:54 < Learath2> thats why i was thinking proof of work like hashcash or sth
20:54 < Learath2> but finished maps is also a nice idea
20:54 < Learath2> if you didnt finish 2 maps you cant vote
20:54 < Henningstone> sounds like fun :D
20:54 <@EastByte> Henningstone: forum accounts are easy to create by a human, so you can just collect them
20:55 < Henningstone> hm true... Does it have a proper registering process at least? with email verification and so on?
20:55 <@EastByte> I think so
20:58 <@EastByte> sad thing is that once we start giving accounts some sort of value people will start mining it
20:58 < Learath2> forum accounts or we could only let email verified accounts to vote
21:01 < necropotame> I've finished only 2 maps \o/ I can vote
21:01 < Learath2> could hand verify the 1000 or so accounts :P
21:02 <@EastByte> you could just let the mods be the only one allowed to vote :p
21:02 < Learath2>   :D
21:02 < Henningstone> you could just remove the entire voting thing, who needs that anyway :P
21:02 <@EastByte> disabling kickvoting and trusting mods is the next best option I think
21:06 < Learath2> do we even have enough modpower? :P
21:07 <@EastByte> we have more mods for GER than I like to have
21:09 < Learath2> +1 i guess less mods less better
21:09 <@EastByte> less better? ^^
21:10 < Learath2> exactly
21:10 < Learath2> === worse
21:10 < Ryozuki> maybe some command like /help to request help from moderator?
21:10 < Ryozuki> usually u can't look all map, so u sometime notice someone is blocking by seeing votes
21:10 < Ryozuki> maybe i explained bad xD
21:12 < Learath2> next project a mod dashboard to display help calls
21:12 < Ryozuki> xD
21:12 < Ryozuki> "Teeworlds police"
21:12 < Ryozuki> call 9tee1
21:13 < Learath2> implementing  right now
21:13 < Ryozuki> rofl
21:37 < necropotame> Ryozuki, I've saw your video, seems nice :) I'm not sure how many game mechanics can use this
21:37 < Ryozuki> me2
21:38 < Ryozuki> i guess we can leave that to mappers (?)
21:38 < necropotame> Sure
21:39 < necropotame> With tune zone that change the curvature, it could be fun ^^
21:40 < necropotame> I guess you can make grenades slow and use it as a timer: you must do something before the grenade touch the ground

21:55 < Ryozuki> as always people are against new things :/
22:04 < necropotame> You should create a PR. Then we could "all" discuss about it
