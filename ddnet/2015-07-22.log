11:03 <@deen> Wow, just got the costs for 2015 covered: http://ddnet.tw/funding/
11:07 < laxadedi> Good news !
11:07 < laxadedi> Big donator or what oO ?
11:08 <@deen> 2 big donations, yes
11:08 <@EastByte> awesome
11:09 <@deen> I guess I should have done the funding site 2 years earlier, ooops
11:09 <@EastByte> and the funding progress bar didn't break its boundaries^^
11:09 <@deen> yep, I'm suprised that I didn't have to fix anything :P
11:13 < laxadedi> Hehe :D
11:13 < laxadedi> You found some friends in rich countries of Africa ?
11:13 < laxadedi> Just saying, some famous streamers got donations up to 50 000$
11:14 <@deen> 50k $ in what? a day? a year?
11:14 <@deen> for server costs? or just as income?
11:15 < laxadedi> donations
11:15 < laxadedi> for streamers
11:15 < laxadedi> http://www.twitch.tv/sodapoppin/profile
11:15 < laxadedi> look on the right : Tip Jar
11:16 < laxadedi> it's one of the biggest streamer on twitch
11:16 < laxadedi> and they got donation just for streaming :)
11:17 <@deen> having the donors sorted by donation amount on the right side probably helps :P
12:24 < KinG_> hey
12:24 <@deen> hi KinG_ 
12:25 < KinG_> we have vnc access

16:49 < Learath2> deen: i have a function that has 3 possible returns and i cover them all in a case but compiler says not all cases covered
16:49 <@deen> Learath2: source?
16:50 <@deen> but i think that's a bug that i reported already
16:50 < Learath2> let me push it
16:51 < Learath2> deen: https://github.com/Learath2/nimircbot/blob/experimental/bot.nim#L56
16:54 <@deen> probably works when you add returns
16:55 < Learath2> deen: i have the returns in place
16:55 <@deen> ah wait
16:55 <@deen> misread the error
16:55 <@deen> https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/2613
16:55 <@deen> might be this bug
16:55 <@deen> ehm, why would bot.loadPlugin(x) only be of 0, -1 and 1?
16:55 <@deen> why can't it be anything else?
16:56 <@deen> you need an else at the end
16:56 < Learath2> well the function only has 3 return statements 
16:56 <@deen> aaah, now i get what you want
16:56 <@deen> the compiler doesn't analyze stuff like that
16:56 <@deen> in more complicated procs it would be impossible to analyze
16:56 <@deen> instead you should make an enum for the return type and return that
16:57 <@deen> or return a range
16:57 < Learath2> return a range ?
16:57 <@deen> because the return type being int, the compiler expects that any int can be returned
16:57 <@deen> proc loadPlugin(...): range[-1..1]
16:57 <@deen> but returning magic numbers to indicate errors is not ideal
16:58 < Learath2> where does the enum belong ? the global scope ?
16:58 <@deen> instead you should have an enum X = success, errorNonexisting, errorLoaded
16:58 <@deen> i guess
17:11 <@deen> or throw exceptions, depending on what you prefer
17:19 <@heinrich5991> deen: you probably want the total donations thing to be green :)
17:19 <@heinrich5991> http://ddnet.tw/funding/
17:19 <@deen> oh, right^^
17:19 <@heinrich5991> (also on the main page)
17:21 < Learath2> oh thats nice ddnet is fully funded :D
17:32 <@deen> yep, pretty great. got 600 â‚¬ in 3 weeks
18:23 < Sadale> wow. deen great job!
18:23 < Sadale> deen, BTW, the amount of expense is more than I expected. Is that yearly expense?
18:24 < Sadale> 360EUR for GER server? :o

20:05 <@EastByte> deen: switch to mixed case server names?
20:05 <@EastByte> what's wrong abuot case sensitive?
20:17 <@deen> what's wrong is that I just uppercase the first character
20:17 <@deen> which works great for Novice, Moderate, Brutal, ... but not for DDmaX
20:18 <@EastByte> ah
20:49 < Learath2> deen: i have a pointer to a function how do i call it ?
20:49 < Learath2> it literally is of type pointer
20:50 < Learath2> I got it with symAddr
20:50 <@deen> cast it to a proc var i guess
20:54 < Learath2> oh i broke nim
20:57 < Learath2> deen: if im getting c compiler errors it means i broke nim yes ?
20:59 <@deen> not if you do casts
20:59 <@deen> with casts you can do anything unreasonable you want
21:00 < Learath2> well my cast does look suspicious :D
21:00 < Learath2> how should i have casted to a proc var ?
21:00 <@deen> not sure
21:01 <@deen> make a minimal example and I'll try to get it working
21:01 < Learath2> i tried cast[(void -> PluginInterface)](x) which definately didnt work :D
21:05 <@deen> ah, {.cdecl.} should help
21:05 < Learath2> deen: http://codepad.org/tobqiZRF
21:05 <@deen> cool, github broke gist, i can't paste anymore
21:06 < Learath2> gist seems fine for me 
21:06 < Learath2> even from sublime
21:06 <@deen> https://gist.github.com/def-/fe216186cae3262d4759
21:06 <@deen> this works for me ^
21:08 < Learath2> cant make the table happy that way tho Error: type mismatch: got (Table[system.string, proc (): PluginInterface{.closure.}], string, proc (): PluginInterface{.cdecl.})
21:09 <@deen> then define the table to be Table[string, proc: PluginInterface{.cdecl.}] as well
21:09 < Learath2> {.nimcall.} worked better 
21:10 <@deen> but is wrong of course :P
21:10 <@deen> http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#types-procedural-type
21:10 < Learath2> why would it be the dlls are also written in nim
21:10 <@deen> ah, ok
21:10 <@deen> i assumed they're in C
21:10 < Learath2> should actually get a way to make that also possible
21:28 < Learath2> cant get it to work oh well wont waste any more of my time

21:32 <@deen> ^ wanted this for a long time
21:32 <@deen> might also help with making better videos
21:32 <@deen> spectating both players, freeview
21:33 <@deen> and it's fun to go through my old demos and watch some other people playing at totally different parts of the map^^
21:35 <@EastByte> neat
21:38 <@deen> it doesn't work perfectly, because the server doesn't send all evens, even with /showall
21:38 <@deen> but sending all events caused too many lags for people with bad connections
21:38 <@deen> and some maps have lots of lasers that would always have to be sent
21:51 < laxadedi> !twp /dev/null
21:51 < Nimda> No /dev/null found online.

23:01 < Chairn> im on windows 7 ^^
23:03 < Learath2> Chairn: have experience with git ?
23:03 <@deen> Chairn: commit multiple times, then push once
23:04 < Chairn> Learath2: not on windows
23:04 < Chairn> only on linux
23:04 < Chairn> if i can avoid setting a vm
23:04 < Learath2> well get git it comes with msys
23:04 < Learath2> which kinda emulates a posix layer on windows
23:04 < Learath2> its called msysgit iirc

23:23 < Chairn> im installing it
23:23 < Chairn> i already have mingw, it uses the same application to install
23:28 < Chairn> hum, im not sure it installed git 
23:28 < Chairn> in the bin folder, it does not appear
23:28 < Learath2> uhm msysgit doesnt install with the same application as mingw
23:29 < Learath2> https://git-scm.com/download/win
23:29 < Learath2> should get you git bash
23:29 < Chairn> ah, it's one word :D
23:29 < Chairn> that's why

23:35 < Learath2> yep
23:36 < Learath2> that should get you ddnet
23:36 < Chairn> erf, have to paste my 2 lines modifications for now :D
23:38 < Chairn> wut, 20% 50MB?
23:38 < Learath2> ?
23:38 < Chairn> what is that heavy?
23:38 < Learath2> the entire history of the tw repo i guess
23:39 <@deen> mostly the binary libraries we have in there
23:39 <@deen> and the versions of them that have been in
23:39 < Learath2> or that
23:39 <@deen> other directory is 100 MB
23:50 <@deen> I hope what I did to the license is ok, no idea about legals: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/license.txt
23:50 < Chairn> meh, autocompletion doesnt work on windows command line with git...
23:51 <@deen> Chairn: install zsh!

23:54 < Chairn> does the git folder has to be named ddnet?
23:55 <@deen> no idea, sounds weird
23:55 <@deen> ah, are you trying to push to my repo?
23:55 < Chairn> i cloned ddnet.git
23:55 < Chairn> then comitted and pushed
23:55 <@deen> yes, you can't push to my repo
23:55 <@deen> you have to fork it, if you want your stuff public on github
23:56 < Chairn> i tried fork
23:56 < Chairn> git says unknown command
23:56 <@deen> fork on github, then clone your fork
23:56 <@deen> https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/
23:57 <@deen> It's all a bit complicated
23:57 < Chairn> ah great, so i can commit all the modifications i made then :D
23:58 < Chairn> youhou 150MB again
