00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Is it currently possible to run check when using `ninja` to build ?
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @RafaelFF yes. `ninja run_tests`
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Yey. -1.5 min when building with ninja.  Nice.
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Will change in AUR ddnet package.
02:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Can I change my text entities(cl_text_entities) size/scale somehow ? May be it is not relevant place to ask such questions so sorry for this.
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> not cool(
02:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> thx, @jao
02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how would it help?
02:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> they are way too big for me. Just wanted to have them smaller since I can nicely see them even with huge zoom out
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @jao , ofc it depends on ppi and resolution but it would be nice to have possibility to scale them up
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> hm
04:21 <+eeeee> deen: funny enough teewebs started as an online demo viewer, but then i was too lazy to make the necessary ui changes
08:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @RafaelFF On Arch if you're using the AUR you should definitely set MAKEFLAGS="-jXX" in /etc/makepkg.conf
08:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but not too high if you plan to compile some large-scale projects and have a low amount of memory
08:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @RafaelFF for a from-scratch build ninja and make should be nearly identical with the same parallelization
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 thanks for the reviews
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen for the color stuff, should we maybe handle those in the console? Something like a victim
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> didn't know how victim is handled
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but yes, that would be nicer, and I wanted to do something like that in a next step
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but we have other color formats in there as well for the UI
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i thought maybe just unify everything and store it as an RGB number actually, since they are converted to RGB on every frame anyway...
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also, not just console, it's a config setting, so it should work consistently when you set it in your config file
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @deen I saw the change in the README, thanks.
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> xD
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> But if I set the flag only in my /etc/makepkg.conf, other users won't take benefit of it. Maybe I should same in between value (don't know if 8 is too much) in the PKGBUILD
11:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> But if I set the flag only in my /etc/makepkg.conf, other users won't take benefit of it. Maybe I should use the a in-between value for the flag (don't know if 8 is too much) in the PKGBUILD
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> In the PKGBUILD you can't know what the user prefers
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they might have a system with 500 threads, but limited RAM, so they want 1 thread
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or they might be doing something on the side
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> everyone who uses the AUR should b e aware of /etc/makepkg.conf
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/makepkg#Tips_and_tricks
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and if you set it to 8 in the PKGBUILD then you overwrite what the user willingly set in makepkg.conf
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Good point

18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> help, i have a server on linux and use file based records. on the one map it works just fine, but on the other map the records file wont get created. if i create it manually it still doesnt work, any idea why?
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> edit: on the other map it also doesnt save anymore
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :brownbear:
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut check the log?
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> which?
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> of your server
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder why checkinstall is not available on buster (unstable) but yes on stable and sid
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.debian.org/CheckInstall
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> easy way to package ddnet for me
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i cant do it xD

20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Since i restart it a lot i was wondering if it is an client/server settjng.

20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> look whatâ€™s on top @Ryozuki
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> shudup
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Huh, no QtCreator?
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> notepad++ 3rd
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao intellij is paid
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its 4th
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so not bad
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @deen as i often told i had problems with sdl2 using 10+ clients, it seems to work fine with opengl3 enabled :O
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sublime is also "paid"
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :ninja:
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Emacs is on the bottom because this isn't a stack rank of people's favorite operating systems"
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> intelij is not paid
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> actually
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> there's free version and "pro"
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> for java
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but jetbrains got tools for nearly everything
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if they only mean the java one
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i use clion for c++ and i love it
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for free due to student license
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> the Java one ise called "InteliJ"
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> for C/C++ "JetBrains CLion"
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> etc
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ik..
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> INtelliJ is specifically for java
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> where is clion on the ranking
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt appear which is weird
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i find clion way better than vs
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> me either
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> vscode best
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but clion has no free version
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> yea, it doesn't. probably only for open-source projects
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Savander> if you join to their partnership program
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki you know that the emacs navigation is integrated in every standard unix terminal?
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so it is much more widley used than vim
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen idk what you mean by check the logs, in the server log is just "player x finished in xx min"
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i cant find the problem
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vim is best
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut my guess is that the DDNet-Server.exe doesn't have permissions to create files
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it does, it can create my account files aswell and this doesnt seem to be the problem because i created a record manually to try this out and it couldnt write into it
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try to give full permissions on records directory
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> will do when im back home
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> this might actually be it
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can confirm that we don't log failures
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I tried taking away permissions from records directory and get the same problem as you and no error
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe i forgot to change permissions from root to my user
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will inform you about the result tomorrow
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sigh, the file score stuff doesn't use any tw related functions for opening files
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no wonder there re no errors reported, will fix it
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay :)
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then i will merge that to my repo manually and have a look where it fails
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen there is also a bug that 2 (( and )) appear for the rank IIRC on filebased records
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when /rank
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and they dont get automatically loaded when you join
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea i fixed that for myself
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pls make a pr
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u can
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dunno if it conflicts with sql
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bcs i dont have sql i just overwridd it
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bcs i dont have sql i just overwrote it
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its easy, just go into the join function in gamecontext where the LoadScoreThread thing is from mysql. just place a m_Score = m_BestTime under it
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wait
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its this:
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/BlockDDrace/blob/f7008aab3de403bb05e52f65f32447f25d5570d2/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L1067
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> quick pr from mobile xd
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> mobile lol
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut do we have that fix in ddnet++ it looks faimilar to me
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes i made it ages ago to ddpp
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah nice
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> as u can see ddnet++ > ddnet xd
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> blockddrace > ddnet
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> traitor o.O
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> blockddrace > ddnet++
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you should go through blockddrace commits and check some stuff is also unfixed in ddpp yet
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> pr it nobo
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> tomorrow maybe
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CYBFITTNER> blockddrace is trash
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you dont even know it
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CYBFITTNER> same as block
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CYBFITTNER> just different name
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure if I should really start fixing the FileScore code
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we never touched it since it's totally unused in official servers
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye but mostly used on unofficial servers
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you can also promote ddnet++ for filescore supprot :p
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Suggestion: When on fng gamemode (or noby fng) when you try to disconnect while frozen, show a confirmation dialog.
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> pff 'or'
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> because other fng servers dont put a dummy when someone rage quits
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> you just go away like peace idiots
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> also suggestion: console option for `color_to_rgb` to convert from tw colors to rgb
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> also suggestion: console option for `color_to_rgb` to convert from tw colors to rgb or hex
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen i would be very thanksful if you'd fix file Score
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen i would be very thankful if you'd fix file Score
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @CYBFITTNER false
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fixed?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Alexander will do it now
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Colored ping ðŸ‘Œ
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> @deen Thanks
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Also if you could
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> show me somehow
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> how to convert the tw colors using javascript
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i really really really need it
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> i was talking to PeX ingame, and he still uses TWTD and he claims he can't join RUS servers with his client while he can when he uses the ddnet client. anyone got any idea how that is possible?
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye tell him to use ddnet
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> i told him
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> i also explained to use inp_mouseold then
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Alexander try reading ConColorFromRgb and doing those calculations
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> ðŸ‘Œ
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also code at the bottom here: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=7422
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and descriptions by HMH here: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=5876
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> okay i read that first post before
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> but the description by hmh looks very... descriptive and im pretty sure it will help me understand
