14:39 < laxadedi> ' OR 1=1 --
14:39 < laxadedi> ?
14:39 < laxadedi> :D
14:39 < WolfAlex_> laxadedi: trying to inject some sql code into something? 
14:39 < laxadedi> WolfAlex_: just the name of EastByte video
14:42 < WolfAlex_> where? i can't find it
14:42 < WolfAlex_> or just because of injection :/ x)
14:53 <@EastByte> laxadedi: huh?
14:54 < laxadedi> rocketfly_injection
14:54 < laxadedi> sed -i 's/rocketfly/SQL/g'
14:54 <@EastByte> ah
14:54 < laxadedi> well, it's not even funny
14:54 < laxadedi> it's just that it made me think of SQL injection cause of the name of the dmeo
14:55 <@EastByte> well it's the name of the map :P
14:55 <@EastByte> I guess this time it'll be a +200min rank

16:07 < o_be_one> hi :)
19:26 < WolfAlex_> deen: short idea: switch thats only active when you have a specific weapon in your hand
19:27 <@deen> WolfAlex_: sounds too complicated
19:27 <@deen> how would anyone understand how it works?
19:27 < WolfAlex_> hm needs a good mapper
19:31 < Nimda> Excast 2 by Åmol just released on Moderate at 2015-04-09 18:46
20:02 <@EastByte> WolfAlex_: just place the switch in a location only reachable using a specific weapon :P
20:04 < WolfAlex_> hm 
20:11 < MyNewBie> hi @deen check this : https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/173
20:13 <@deen> Everyone else check it too, I don't know why it crashes :P
20:25 < WolfAlex_> deen: how about a switch that is activated if attacked (toggels it state if hit by laser/projectile)
20:31 <@deen> WolfAlex_: we considered that about 1 year ago
20:31 <@deen> maybe nice, but not sure if we need so much more complexity =/
21:22 < ochristi> yo gtt.net 100ms from deutsche telekom -.-
21:39 <@deen> i know
21:46 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1266
21:46 <@deen> I'm in touch with our hoster about this
21:46 <@deen> but they probably won't be able to do anything
21:46 <@deen> so there are only 2 choices: wait for the lags to disappear, or get a new server, probably without ddos protection
21:51 < ochristi> but I do not trust dtag either
21:59 <@deen> at least nfoservers' CEO is talking to internap about this now
21:59 <@deen> but i bet internap knows very well about this
21:59 <@deen> and is just not willing to pay dtag's extra fees
23:39 < Just_a_Nick> hello, someone here who could help me?
23:46 <@deen> ochristi: Some news: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&p=12801#p12801
23:46 <@deen> Just_a_Nick: hi
23:49 < Just_a_Nick> @deen I need your attention
23:49 < Just_a_Nick> also
23:49 < Just_a_Nick> a friend of mine created a teeworlds-skin for me
23:49 < Just_a_Nick> I pushed it per drag and drop into the skins folder
23:49 < Just_a_Nick> but in the client the skin isn't showed
23:50 <@deen> does it work with other skins?
23:50 <@deen> when you copy a new one, for example from http://ddnet.tw/skins
23:50 < Just_a_Nick> yes
23:50 <@deen> then the skin may be in a wrong format
23:50 <@deen> it has to be an rgba png
23:50 < Just_a_Nick> it's .png
23:51 <@deen> can you upload the file somewhere?
23:51 < Just_a_Nick> I made a screen with the details of a default teeworlds skin and mine
23:51 < Just_a_Nick> http://www.bilder-upload.eu/show.php?file=8c8bd3-1428616512.png
23:51 <@deen> I can't see the image there
23:51 < Just_a_Nick> why?
23:52 <@deen> site not loading properly for me
23:52 < Just_a_Nick> lemme try it with another
23:53 < WolfAlex_> Just_a_Nick: the size is wrong, 230x128px is not correct
23:54 < Just_a_Nick> http://www.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/screen118mxki36vg1.png
23:54 < Just_a_Nick> what is the size I have to use?
23:55 <@deen> 256x128
23:55 <@deen> and also RGBA instead of RGB
23:55 <@deen> it's easiest to edit an existing skin, then everything should be right
23:55 < Just_a_Nick> hm ok
23:55 < Just_a_Nick> what is RGB and what is RGBA? :D
23:56 < WolfAlex_> Just_a_Nick: adds transparency
23:56 < Just_a_Nick> thanks for help, I will consult him
23:57 < WolfAlex_> ok :/
23:57 < Just_a_Nick> what's up? :o
23:58 < Just_a_Nick> oh man, he's not answering. I think he is masturbating lol xd
