00:02 < bridge> <oxyzo.> id like to see multiple colors in chat, like

00:02 < bridge> <oxyzo.> id like to see multiple colors in chat, like
00:02 < bridge> <oxyzo.> `echo [red]R[green]G[blue]B`
01:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why?
01:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> invalid colors should be still shown
01:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> `helloworld[orange juice]` = `helloworld[orange juice]`
01:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> whats ur gh name?
01:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also i think [[]] is better since you cant get it wrong way around
01:32 < bridge> <oxyzo.> sure i guess
01:32 < bridge> <oxyzo.> if you mean github its oxyz0
01:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also much easier to type
01:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> gh -> github yes
04:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp

07:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> netmsgs are scary i just want to use id lmao
09:19 < bridge> <totar> There was a discussion about this in here at some time
09:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i tried removing it
09:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and seemed to work until linking
09:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oop no im an idiot
09:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i remember you saying it was required
09:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but uhh
09:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> big X what didnt work xd
09:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> uhmm
10:08 < bridge> <kebscs> What's the point of issue before pr is pr is instantly opened
10:08 < bridge> <kebscs> What's the point of issue before pr if pr is instantly opened
10:21 < bridge> <Assa> Wasn't there a point to explicitly list all files in a directory or something?
10:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i thought it would be harder
10:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but thats kinda pointless
10:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i have as much vision on the cmakelists files as the directory structure
10:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which is none
10:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cmakelists also gets merge conflicts and you have to worry about order
10:44 < bridge> <Assa> I wouldn't do that for assets btw, like the data/ directory
10:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wdym
10:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wouldnt remove it or keep it?
10:45 < bridge> <Assa> I am in favor of glob recursive for code, but not for assets
10:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why
10:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> any files added or removed goes through review by atleast 1 person
10:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not the source one
10:46 < bridge> <Assa> automapper files, mapres, maps, ...
10:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the source one never gets custom assets
10:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the source one never gets custom assets, the install dir sometimes does but shouldnt
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> yes, datasrc is fine, I was talking about `data/`
10:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you shouldnt compile ddnet with custom assets in data/
10:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> das a bit silly
10:47 < bridge> <Assa> why? also hold my beer
10:47 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because thats what the config dir is for
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which is shareable across clients
10:48 < bridge> <Assa> sometimes I experiment with different assets, and I want to keep the old versions around
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can version control your config
10:48 < bridge> <Assa> or I have old_asset.png.bac
10:48 < bridge> <Assa> or something like that
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> if you mean the data/ in build/data then you can put stuff in there aswell, i used that as my "install dir" for a while
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its as bad as putting stuff in the install dir, but its less bad than the source/data
10:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and that isnt version controlled or looked after by cmakelists
10:49 < bridge> <Assa> `ln -s build/data data/`
10:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> how about
10:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> dont do that
10:50 < bridge> <Assa> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è compiling doesn't update the assets in the build dir
10:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cmake ../.. should
10:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cmake .. should
10:50 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and you could just edit the ones in the build dir then
10:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> pretend the source one doesnt exist
10:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you should still be doing it in the normal config tho
10:51 < bridge> <Assa> I am still not a fan of this (for assets), this is error prone, I won't be the only one
10:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is it error prone?
10:51 < bridge> <Assa> because people will push assets on accident
10:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and that will be instnatly spotted
10:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> by clicking on files changes
10:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and seeing the extra file
10:52 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i gues its not enforced by ci, but same goes for code

15:18 < bridge> <kebscs> some settings so its easier to notice?
15:18 < bridge> <Assa> isn't there an option to simulate delay?
15:20 < bridge> <Assa> I wonder if it's just `cl_antiping_limit`, but I don't know
15:25 < bridge> <kebscs> idk
15:26 < bridge> <kebscs> i made plasma turret prediction but idk how i can test it
15:26 < bridge> <kebscs> seem to work from logs
15:26 < bridge> <kebscs> XD
16:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> in factorio, fields can parse math: if u do 1+1
16:08 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i think something like `cl_prediction_margin 200` could help

16:27 < bridge> <patiga> TIL since Rust 1.83 we have https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.transpose and https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.transpose.
16:27 < bridge> <patiga> Which provide `Option<Result<T, E>>` <-> `Result<Option<T>, E>`. I needed this often when I was implementing iterators :)
16:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think it's only const since 1.83
16:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I have used that already from the start when I first used Rust
16:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What is also cool is to `collect` into a `Result<Vec<_>>`
16:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then you can have an iterator over Results of items
16:55 < bridge> <patiga> oh right, its available since 1.33

21:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> This error really doesn't tell us much about what's happening, other than that your graphics drivers failed
21:48 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You might have some outdated or broken graphics drivers, but the worst case is that it's a hardware failure
21:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> If you can't get it to work by updating your graphics drivers you can try switching to the OpenGL backend for rendering
21:50 < bridge> <vahemaaa> okey thanks a lot, and if it happens with OpenGL again?

23:22 < bridge> <gorp_tw> started using niri
23:23 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yea I don't think I'll ever use anything else
23:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> I didn't like it
23:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> It's weird with multiple monitors
23:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> And you can't merge
23:24 < bridge> <gorp_tw> thinking of your monitor as some logical unit of space is now like a deranged idea to me
23:24 < bridge> <gorp_tw> I'm a single monitor girlie
23:24 < bridge> <gorp_tw> too ADHD to be trusted
23:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> Then niri is a perfect fit
23:24 < bridge> <gorp_tw> ya
23:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> XD
23:25 < bridge> <melo∆û> It's bad for multiple monitors, because you can't share a single scroll region across Monitord
23:25 < bridge> <melo∆û> So it's just a more annoying i3
23:25 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yeah I see
23:25 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i force tabbed i3
23:25 < bridge> <gorp_tw> so this is strictly an upgrade for me
23:25 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i view everything fullscreen
23:26 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i might use half screens with niri now that its much more flexible
23:26 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but I just want a keybind that pops up all my system info, date, programs open, + runner

23:27 < bridge> <gorp_tw> stuff
23:27 < bridge> <melo∆û> It comes down to preference ig
23:27 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i need it to be modular
23:27 < bridge> <gorp_tw> fuzzel might not be
23:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> need it to get stdout from stuff
23:29 < bridge> <gorp_tw> also I guess I'm gonna try mako
23:29 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i normally hate notifications on desktop but it seems light
23:30 < bridge> <gorp_tw> do u use sway or hypr?
23:31 < bridge> <melo∆û> Kde :nouis:
23:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> It works without much thought and I'm just as fast with vim like key binds to switch between monitors/windows
23:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
23:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> It also has floating windows, tiling and multiple workspaces
23:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> Also a big fan of kde in general: (spectacle, kdenlive)
