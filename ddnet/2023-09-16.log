02:45 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> github just reccomended me a ddnet bot thing LOLLL
08:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But which one xd
11:48 < bridge> <murpi> Why is compressing image files such a pain in the ass? Some images double in size after compression, and I can't find any good source as to why.
11:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what images are you compressing? which format?
11:54 < bridge> <murpi> .png and .jpeg files
11:54 < bridge> <murpi> .png and .jpg files
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what u mean is, the raw image doubles in size after it's compressed to png?
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or r u trying to optimize them
11:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which tool do you use? are they photos? screenshots?
12:00 < bridge> <murpi> I'm trying to compress photos into an archive file format
12:01 < bridge> <murpi> Photos taken by a 250D, with python
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well images are already compressed
12:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in a format that makes sense for images
12:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> recompressing photos will likely degrade quality or increase size
12:10 < bridge> <murpi> I don't mind the loss in quality. I just want to have them in a archive file, for more streamlined sharing and privacy :/
12:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what do you mean by "archive file"?
12:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> zip? jpg?
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> use .tar
12:11 < bridge> <murpi> zip, rar, 7zip.. you name it
12:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> none of these should cause a significant increase
12:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting
12:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> at most a couple of kilobytes
12:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the 7z program also causes the problem? maybe you can select "compression: store" and compress to a zip file in there?
12:13 < bridge> <murpi> I've tried zipfile.ZIP_STORED already, same issue there
12:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that seems wrong. can you reproduce it with a single image?
12:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not a folder, but just a single image
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @murpi have u checked the archieve doesnt contain the images twice or smth
12:20 < bridge> <murpi> Yes, same issue
12:20 < bridge> <murpi> Just one image in the archive
12:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but the images in the archieve are untouched?
12:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. the same images as before?
12:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you send me a sample image? something is off
12:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or a sample archive
12:21 < bridge> <murpi> What does untouched mean?
12:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean if u uncompress the archive, its the original image again?=
12:22 < bridge> <murpi> decompress
12:22 < bridge> <murpi> and no
12:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i tried some images with lzma2 on max now. it's smaller than the individual files by a small amount
12:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so u wrote a python script that creates the archive and this script somehow touches the images?
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyway, the archive should not rewrite the contents of the files. except u really need minimum possible size, and want to optimize the images.
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the uncompressed files of an archive should be the original files
13:29 < bridge> <yuzu9953> remember when the client wasnt searching for servers, when u started client without internet connection but then connected ? u always had to restart client
13:29 < bridge> <yuzu9953> thysm for this little change
13:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I do not remember ^^
13:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> kinda sounds like a bug in the OS xd
13:31 < bridge> <yuzu9953> shit xd its common thing here, cuz i use my mobile phone. often i havent connected when tw started
13:32 < bridge> <yuzu9953> it works since few ddnet versions. dunno where was the change
13:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think this channel's description is outdated
13:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it mentions a matrix channel that might no longer exist(?)
14:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> time to call for a discord mod

15:03 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> does player's info page works on ddnet website?
17:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
17:38 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Before it didnt :p

19:31 < bridge> <warner6439> hi, I wanna add my own sql connector using mariadb, so I've included the right headers but it still can't use the functions (apparently undef refs), do I need to add something to the cmakelist to make it work? (I used mysql/mysql.h and mysql/mysqld_error.h)
19:31 < bridge> <warner6439> 
19:31 < bridge> <warner6439> btw, i know that there already is a sql connector around, just wanna do my own db
19:37 < bridge> <ultrakeker> Just copy `cmake/FindMySQL.cmake` and rewrite this for mariadb headers and libs, after it add `find_library(MariaDB)`(MariaDB is for file `cmake/FindMariaDB.cmake`) to CMakeLists.exe
19:52 < bridge> <warner6439> cmakelists.exe?
19:52 < bridge> <warner6439> 
19:52 < bridge> <warner6439> these find.cmake files search for headers right? so can't i just add the right headers directly into findmysql.cmake ?
20:00 < bridge> <ultrakeker> Find.cmake files is using for finding headers and libraries in your system/paths, right. Just create file `FindMariaDB.cmake`(or smth you like), copy stuff from `FindMySQL.cmake`(or other find.cmake file) and edit paths, names of files and names of variables, after this all write in CMakeLists.txt this line `find_library(MariaDB)`(MariaDB is end of find.cmake file) and add your generated variables(example: `MARIADB_LIBRARIES` and `MARIADB_INCLUD
20:00 < bridge> <ultrakeker> My English is so bad xdd
20:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chillerdragon: can u tell the guy in #questions (fsfosa) if your chillerbot ux is banable.. i have no overview over its features. and you are a honest guy and wouldn't advertise bots xd
