15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> @BannZay when maximum speed 2
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Didnt find it very popular (but personally I like it) so never tho
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I wonder why there is no spectator mode after you connected a game. In case of ddnet - there is, but it is server side only (/pause) and not supported by some servers. I figured out that there is no major limitations to have client side spectator (with ddnet I found only one - you got to use /showall). So I suggesting to rework camera so it will go through following steps:
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 1. Enter spectator mode (set cam_type = spectactor) regardless of the server version (dont rely on spec snapshot anymore)
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 2. If the server is DDNet like then extend this method to send "/showall or /pause" command on specating enter (the same on exit)
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> benefits: you can use specator if server under ddos or not support /pause command
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I am about to start work on it but I am afraid I missing something important so asking what you think about it
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I wonder why there is no spectator mode after you connected a game (without killing yourself). In case of ddnet - there is, but it is server side only (/pause) and not supported by other servers. I figured out that there is no major limitations to have client side spectator (with ddnet I found only one - you got to use /showall). So I suggest to rework camera code so it will go through following steps:
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 1. Enter spectator mode (set cam_type = spectactor) regardless of the server version (dont rely on spec snapshot anymore)
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 2. If the server is DDNet like then send "/showall or /pause" command on specating start (the same on end)
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> 
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> benefits: you can use specator if server under ddos or not support /pause command
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @BannZay why r there weapons in maximum speed when u cant wallshot urself
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @BannZay also if /pause is available on all servers it would be cool but might lead to cheats like easier camping in fng
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I never understand people calling ability to spectate a cheat. Keeping this in mind, how does things like cl_overlay_entities/dummy_copy moves/dummy hamer fly/etc/etc/etc even released?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> u
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> having pause on fng is like being able to zooz there
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> it should be a consern of the client
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> it should be a consern of the server
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> some servers disabled zoom
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I dont call it a cheat on DDRace but on pvp mods its a cheat lmao
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> u can easily enable zooz tho
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :troll:
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> with a other client tho
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> with DDNet
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> :surprised_pikachu:
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> its just adding // at a special line The code and compile it
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> yeah thats a other client
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> no its modified client
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> i used to zooz on fng
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> even though this ability is a cheat then fng admins should fix their servers since its not a problem at all to find propriate client to play with
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I am not sure if it so bad that DDNet client will be one of them
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> when i have a layer selected and rightclick on another one to change its properties, it doesnt switch to that layer. that hasnt always been this way and its throwing me off lately
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> especially because it still opens the menu for the other layer
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> sounds reasonable. Request "open settings for this layer" are handled xD
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh, it opens settings for the selected layer. Not cool then
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh, it opens settings for the selected (active) layer. Not cool then
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh, it opens settings for the active but not "clicked on" layer . Not cool then
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> There is no problems with groups. Only layers. It should be fixed tho
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> "ddnet admins should just fix their servers since its not a problem to find a bot client to cheat there"
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ðŸ§ 
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> there are fixes u can do to make zoom way less effective on pvp mods but it is still a cheat
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> yes, a nice thing to be in DDNet. I can not imagine modern game without anticheat nowadays
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> but clientside "anticheat" is so weird thing to be tho. I am not asking to add distructive functionality but a handy thing
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Im 'corneum same its in a new update and its p annoying lmao
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> (which might not like some of users, surely...)
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> u cant really do client side anticheat
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> in an open source game especially
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> that is what I am talking about
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> just because the nature of a game makes certain cheats hard to 100% patch doesnt make those things not cheats xd
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> Well, we went far away from the subject. My request is not about removing the client "checks" like "if its fng - then dont allow to zoom" but making clientside spectator. You want to disable it for fng - fine. Do it regardless my opinion about it
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :feelsamazingman:
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think client news is what most ppl actually see
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i think so too
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> i only see discord and client
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> add the ddnet discord link to ddnet client
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> hi. having problems DOWNLOADING ddnet on steam
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> starts and a sec later closes
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> someone?
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Zave haven't heard about that problem. Platform? Is there some error message in Steam?
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is a common steam bug
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not related to ddnet
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u mean the client starts
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or the download
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> the download
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ok, just checked and couldn't find any known problems reported by Steam
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/750820514066333696/screenshot-20200902225212.png
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then its steam
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ask steam support
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> Thanks
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe clear the downlaod cache
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or something related
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> tryied
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> tried
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> not working
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/750820991348899971/unknown.png
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> downloaded to my another disk, now good
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> did u have space
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in the disk
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> ye
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> 500 gb
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> ddnet takes 500 gb ? :v
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> more like 50 MB
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> ohh, my antivirus dont like the ddnt file
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> hmm interesting
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen maybe u can sign ddnet on windows
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth like that
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows stuff
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Zave you can report this to your antivirus company as a false positive and tell them that we are released on steam, then it should be fine
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki I thought if you run it from steam you don't get the warning?
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah u dont i think
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Zave> okay okay, thanks
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The certificate costs at least 100 â‚¬ / year, seems like a bit of a waste
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> windows evil
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, you don't pay it to Microsoft
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> :monkaS:
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> some antiviruses is dumb so hard. I been wondered so hard one time. Let me teach you how to make a virus. You should make a project on c# with the name Hack.Spy aaaand ... you are done, you might be blocked . (https://github.com/hackf5/unityspy/issues/12)
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> oh actually Houston I`ve got a problem as well, i thought that server is not shipping with steam version, BUT:
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/750825911191863316/unknown.png
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best antivirus is to use linux :greenthing:
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nouis troll
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberFighter> :justatest: ddnet is virus confirmed
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when linux has fl studio support ill switch
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> not sure, should we create an issue. But there is a thing we should now to provide users with answers
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/750826919372521482/unknown.png
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis use wine
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> not sure, should we create an issue. But there is a thing we should know to provide users with answers
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/750826919372521482/unknown.png
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u think i havent tried
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=178
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u cant slap wine on anything and expect it to work 100%
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have to use the best wine version
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for it
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ?xd
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it doesnt work
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur just a nobo
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @louis support open source use https://lmms.io/
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no lmms is probably 5% as good as fl
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nobo
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/750827523142582312/unknown.png
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ðŸ¤® ewww
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats wrong
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ugly
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so thats ur reason to say it has 5% of what fl has
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont find that argument convicing
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> convincing
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> well first i alr bought fl studio and have experience in it and that's more worth than some moral compass that i should support open source
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u bought fl studio so u obviously will convince urself its better
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> otherwise u would feel bad
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also fl studio has been a paid product for a long time and probably has better features than this lmms
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :))
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if ur making electronic music u heavily rely on plugins
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> which is what takes up a lot of electronic music production budget
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its not about the daw
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> uu have plugins that cost like $2000
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and only a select few free plugins are good compared to the rest
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> o well i guess i shouldn't be talking about this in dev channel
