16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Im 'corneum one of many unholy features
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol nice one @Jupstar âœª
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> how can i compile the new source and run few port ? github's guide is not complete
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> how can i compile the new source ( cmake ) and run few port ? github's guide is not complete
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TcTc which part is incomplete?
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Compile and execute the executable multiple times with different configs, each specifying a unique port
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo @deen was back then in bam times something different with the icons? Because i did the same thing and replaced the DDNet.cio file in other/icons and them bam -c all and recompiled but the icon is still ddnet
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you probably need to force a recompilation somhow
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for example by deleting the executable
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> otherwise it might not detect the change
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> haha it worked now i changed nothing just waited
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> didnt even rebuild
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe some windows cache
