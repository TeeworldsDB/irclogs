00:06 < WolfAlex> goto_die: fakeing gametype is a bad idea
00:07 < goto_die> why
00:07 < goto_die> I just did it
00:07 < WolfAlex> iirc (@ EastByte ) sending a non ddrace gametype, but sending ddnet snaps will result in not seeing the bullets 
00:07 < goto_die> right now
00:08 < goto_die> Fack
00:08 < Henningstone> oh damn you are right... totally forgot about that bug
00:08 < goto_die> what do you advertise me to do?
00:09 < Henningstone> *recommend ;)
00:09 < WolfAlex> goto_die: check if client is requesting the pings (when he is showing the scoreboard) and only over that time fake the gametype? xD
00:09 < goto_die> xDDDDD
00:10 < goto_die> yes my english vocabulary is no the best, but thanks :P
00:10 < goto_die> but btw, wich bullets do you mean? ^^
00:11 < Henningstone> gun and grenade
00:11 < goto_die> no its working
00:11 < Henningstone> oh that's nice!
00:11 < WolfAlex> oh
00:11 < WolfAlex> maybe the gametype is only checked while connecting?
00:12 < goto_die> I'm faking the gametype "DDNet" and everything is just working
00:12 < goto_die> @WolfAlex I don't think so
00:12 < WolfAlex> yes goto_die but ddnet also shows time xD
00:12 < goto_die> no ._.
00:12 < WolfAlex> rly? :o
00:12 < goto_die> yep
00:12 < Henningstone> @WolfAlex: look at "engine/shared/serverbrowser.cpp" for the criteria of a "race gamemode"
00:13 < Henningstone> â†’ the gamemode must contain the word "race" :D
00:13 < WolfAlex> oh
00:13 < goto_die> fine I finally figured it out xD
00:15 < goto_die> thanks for your help :)
00:15 < Henningstone> no problem :)
00:15 < goto_die> I have one more little question :P
00:16 < Henningstone> ofc
00:16 < goto_die> lets explain: I first check the client version and then send into chat that this client has been entered
00:17 < goto_die> if he disconnects fastly it wouldn't show up that he has been tried to enter
00:18 < goto_die> and this would cause confusion, so what do you recommend me to do? :D
00:20 < Henningstone> where do you do this?
00:20 < goto_die> what exactly? checking the client version?
00:20 < Henningstone> printing it into the chat
00:22 < goto_die> in /game/server/player.cpp and /game/server/gamecontext.cpp
00:22 < Henningstone> in both files???
00:23 < goto_die> because DDNet already checks the client version so i just had to disable the normal entering message
00:23 < goto_die> and add a print under the dbg_msg "using custom client"
00:24 < Henningstone> oh so you replaced the usual entering message? Then everything should be fine...
00:24 < goto_die> yep its working
00:24 < goto_die> but
00:24 < goto_die> check this // Magic number when we can hope that client has successfully identified itself
00:25 < goto_die> in /game/server/player.cpp
00:25 < Henningstone> got it! one second...
00:26 < Henningstone> and you've put it into there?
00:26 < goto_die> because if he is not using ddnet it takes some time to identify and then if he disconnect fastly just the "has left the game" will appear
00:26 < goto_die> yep
00:27 < goto_die> I'm not that good at "server modding"
00:29 < Henningstone> hmm sorry, just know and from nothing more than a bit info I can't help you much... Also it's quite late :o
00:30 < goto_die> I know I'm tired too, sorry for that :D
00:30 < Henningstone> I'd put it into gameconetxt.cpp Line 908
00:30 < Henningstone> so under the "sometee has entered the game" message
00:31 < goto_die> thats complicated
00:31 < goto_die> because
00:31 < goto_die> I want to do something like : "entered the game (using ddnet)"
00:32 < goto_die> if he is using ddnet the "verify" is quite fast so there are no problems but if he is not using ddnet it takes some time to "verify" that he has not ddnet and if he disconnect in this time no entering message will be sent
00:33 < Henningstone> then replace that message by yours ^^ In player.cpp, you could have a member variable which is set if the client verified that he uses a ddnet client. In gamecontext.cpp, you could check for that variable
00:34 < goto_die> I want to keep it very simple
00:35 < Henningstone> that wouldn't be much complicated... just one variable and you problem should be solved
00:39 < goto_die> but I'm very tired
00:44 < Henningstone> You can also do it tomorrow :) Just add a new variable "bool m_IsDDNetClient" to player.h, then in player.cpp, below the "Magic number when we hope"-thingy, put "m_IsDDNetClient = true" into the if-statement, and in gamecontext.cpp you then can just do "if(m_apPlayers[ClientID]->m_IsDDNetClient") SendChat(-1, CGameContext::CHAT_ALL, "player not using ddnet");" or something
00:44 < Henningstone> and you are done
00:45 < goto_die> yeah but the problem would still be the same or?
00:46 < Henningstone> the message would be sent earlier so that a non-ddnet-player cannot disconnect before it appears
00:46 < Henningstone> at least I think it would ^^ It's just in theory and I'm also tired ;)
00:47 < goto_die> ah the problem is that the message from player.cpp comes later than gamecontext.cpp ?
00:47 < goto_die> because I don't even know where the problem is exactly xD
00:47 < Henningstone> that is what you said, I don't know if it is true
00:48 < goto_die> no i said its because it checks the input thing first (takes a sec) and then spreads out the message
00:49 < Henningstone> hm then I really don't know. But I'll go to bed now...
00:49 < goto_die> okay, thank you very much and good night
00:49 < Henningstone> good night
15:08 < goto_die> heyho, many people are complaining about the 64 bit release of the newest version (does not open)
15:13 < o_be_one> havent did yet
16:22 <@deen> goto_die: yes, it doesn't work. not sure if anyone plans to find out why or fix it
17:21 < Caodym> HI !
17:26 < o_be_one> plop
20:24 <@deen> i fixed the 64bit windows version
23:00 < coffee> hi
23:00 <@deen> hi
23:00 <@deen> coffee: someone asked for blockZ source code
23:00 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=2946
23:01 < coffee> oh
23:02 < coffee> You disagree, but we're still friends right?
23:02 <@deen> friends? I disagree with everyone, don't worry about that :P
23:04 < coffee> Could I improve the mod ?
23:05 <@deen> I have to say I don't know. I don't play it, but in the last weeks the GER blockZ server was sometimes pretty full
23:06 < coffee> If the server is empty the rest of the time, then, close it
23:07 <@deen> not my decision, I don't run ddnet anymore :P
23:08 < coffee> nevermind
23:10 < coffee> At least, people are talking about my mod
