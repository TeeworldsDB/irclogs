00:07 < Ryozuki> your server actually runs with mysql and save race times?
00:07 < Ryozuki> TwItCh__
00:09 < TwItCh__> Yea it does
00:15 < laxa> afaik, you need maria db rather than mysql
00:16 < SPYRES> ok we will give it a try. I think thats our solution :P
00:17 < SPYRES> If the server fails to connect to db, will it post an entry in the logs but anychance just to confirm?
00:18 < laxa> compile server with -g and use gdb
00:18 < TwItCh__> If Im using the command sv_use_mysql 1 in the autoexec_server.cfg file, should it say in the server log that it connected successfully to the mysql database ?
00:18 < laxa> afaik, only some features requires maria db
00:18 < laxa> at least /save
00:18 < TwItCh__> Ok thanks will give it a try
00:18 < laxa> I guess the only one to help you would be deen or maybe EastByte
00:20 < TwItCh__> DoNe and H.M.H have helped me aswell
00:20 < SPYRES> To be honest with you I am a complete noob but thats not going to stop me hehehe
00:20 < laxa> if you can read and understand code, you should be able to get that done
00:20 < laxa> also use gdb might be some help
00:20 < TwItCh__> gdb?
00:21 < SPYRES> you see.. i can read and understand code but basic basic because im still developing my skill. :)
00:21 < laxa> gnu debugger
00:23 < SPYRES> okay ill cry myself to sleep xD dont worry.. ive taken your advice seriously and im on it LOL. Basically you have 2 noobs trying to make a server which we will eventually succeed :P
00:24 < TwItCh__> Hey ! SPYRES Im not that noob xD
00:24 < SPYRES> dont lie.. you are TwItCh__ <3
00:33 <@deen> no features require mariadb, mysql should work just the same
00:34 <@deen> TwItCh__: did you compile the server with "bam server_sql_release"?
00:34 <@deen> and yes, in the log it should say that it connected to the SQL server
00:35 < TwItCh__> Oh ok cool I got mariadb now, it's not saying anything about mysql in the autoexec_server.log
00:36 <@deen> and for points you need to insert entries into the record_maps table
00:36 <@deen> did you compile the server with server_sql_release?
00:36 <@deen> it's DDNet-Server_sql
00:36 <@deen> not DDNet-Server
00:36 < TwItCh__> Yeah I see
00:36 < TwItCh__> I didn't :(
00:37 < TwItCh__> I told SPYRES but he didn't listen
00:37 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet#building at the bottom
00:37 < SPYRES> lies 
00:37 < SPYRES> thanks deen for your help
00:37 < TwItCh__> Yeah thanks alot @deen
00:40 < SPYRES> Regarding the entries for record_map. We are importing the sql dump you made when you were considering closing ddnet
00:43 <@deen> SPYRES: ok, easiest solution
00:46 < TwItCh__> When I run bam server_sql_release it gives error saying cannot open other/sdl/sdl.lua : No such file or directory
00:47 < SPYRES> sorry for our noobness. We are aspiring learners at heart :P
00:54 < SPYRES> we will follow this i guess http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2730
00:59 < SPYRES> its alive :O we got the bam to work :P
00:59 < SPYRES> its compiling xD
00:59 < TwItCh__> the server_sql_release
01:00 < SPYRES> you guys must be think how dumb we are hehehe <3
01:05 < SPYRES> thinking*
01:26 < Ryozuki> he my guide worked for you? ^^
01:26 < SPYRES> YES!
01:27 < SPYRES> everything look good. We just need to setup points but it saves times and when you reconnect it looks good
01:27 < SPYRES> thanks lot!
01:28 < Ryozuki> the guide is also here
01:28 < Ryozuki> http://wiki.ddnet.tw/view/Setting_up_a_Server
01:28 < Ryozuki> :P
01:29 < Ryozuki> cya i have to go know
