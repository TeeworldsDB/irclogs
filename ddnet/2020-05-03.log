13:08 <+ChillerDragon> Does one know how to unslect a video on youtube? I always keep pausing the video instead of scrolling with spacebar
13:08 <+ChillerDragon> the internet seems to have the opposite problem
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> need to click somewhere else with the mouse
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 I fixed whisper now by doing it the same as normal chat mssages that are out of range. When receiving a whisper I send the WHISPER_RECV from cid=63, and the message includes the name in front
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (63 is like 15 in ddnet, VANILLA_MAX_CLIENTS-1)
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it has no name
13:22 <+ChillerDragon> omg i dont want to use my mouse and even that doesnt work
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ChillerDragon: then use tab to un-focus the video
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> after that you're good to go with spacebar scrolling
