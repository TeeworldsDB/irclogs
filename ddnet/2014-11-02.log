11:34 <@deen> EastByte: does "FRA went down" mean that the ddnet.tw server isn't reachable?
11:34 <@deen> not EastByte , laxa^^
11:34 <@deen> because we have no more FRA server
11:36 <@EastByte> ah
12:02 < Nimda_1716> DDNet FRA went down!
12:02 <@deen> and the website is always reachable for me
12:03 <@deen> maybe Nimda's server is just having problems

17:42 <@EastByte> nice behavior of ovh routing
17:42 <@EastByte> or it's the firewall
17:42 <@deen> ouch =/
17:42 <@EastByte> I remember that from ddmax
17:43 <@EastByte> some udp dst prots had highping
17:43 <@EastByte> ports*

17:45 <@deen> hm, why is there no good hoster? =/
17:47 <@EastByte> network stability<->ddos protection<->low cost
17:47 <@EastByte> just doesnt fit together^^
19:09 <@deen> EastByte: EUR feels weird
19:09 <@deen> have some 1 second long delays while using ssh
19:11 <@EastByte> well, fine for me
19:11 <@EastByte> but it looks really unstable today
19:11 <@deen> could you disable the firewall?
19:12 <@deen> and see if that helps?
19:12 <@EastByte> okay I will
19:14 <@EastByte> deen: I disabled it
19:14 <@EastByte> 32mbit/s
19:14 <@deen> oh
19:14 <@EastByte> looks like ddos
19:14 <@deen> yeah, enable it again^^
19:14 <@deen> haha
19:14 <@deen> good to know
19:14 <@EastByte> ^^
19:15 <@EastByte> I hope the firewall doesnt fail now^^

21:30 <@deen> Database got desynced a few days ago and i didn't notice, oops^^
21:30 <@deen> and someone changed the time in South Africa...
21:30 <@deen> on the server
21:30 <@EastByte> lol
21:30 <@deen> always great when you use the time to determine who won the tournament!
21:30 <@deen> because it showed the south africans as first :P
21:32 <@EastByte> https://eastbit.net/public/videos/spooky.webm
21:32 <@EastByte> tournament worked out well for me
21:33 <@EastByte> hm I need to switch to 60fps
21:34 <@deen> haha, nice EastByte 
21:34 <@deen> Syncing database from Chile -> South Africa now
21:34 <@deen> this takes some time^^
21:35 <@EastByte> good luck
21:35 <@deen> It should work automatically!
21:40 <@deen> done, worked!
22:01 <@deen> Proof that we can do it without a dummy tournament as well: http://ddnet.tw/609.png (1264x24099 awesome pixels)
22:02 <@EastByte> man I need a simple http fileupload server
22:02 <@deen> why?
22:02 <@EastByte> to give other people a possibility to upload files to me
22:02 <@EastByte> do we have some python webapp?
22:02 <@deen> we?
22:02 <@deen> i have a 10 year old php script for file uploads^^
22:03 <@EastByte> php.. no ^^
22:03 <@EastByte> and it should be js/interactive
22:03 <@deen> since the forum is php as well, i'm running php anyway, so i don't care
22:03 <@deen> if you find a nice one, send me a link
22:25 <@deen> hi xRoThx, hi cris272
