00:00 < CookieMichal> I was on the server all the time :I
00:00 < CookieMichal> OR u kicked me while I was AFK xD

00:16 < Nimda> DDNet USA went down!
00:17 < CookieMichal> I cri ^
00:18 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
00:19 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
00:26 <@deen> first time USA is down by ddos =/
01:18 < eeeee> deen: wanna try ec2 once again? they opened a new dc in frankfurt recently
01:18 <@deen> eeeee: yeah, that one would be really interesting
02:11 < Nimda> Website went down!
02:11 < Nimda> Website went back online!
02:11 < Nimda> Website went down!
02:11 < Nimda> Website went back online!
02:11 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went down!
02:11 < Nimda> DDNet RUS went back online!
02:24 <@deen> GER2 running thanks to eeeee 
02:33 < Nimda> New server detected : DDNet GER2!
02:37 < Nimda> DDNet GER2 went back online!
02:39 < eeeee> wut
02:43 <@deen> just my bad^^
02:43 <@deen> no problem with the srever
02:43 <@deen> i always have this problem with ubuntu
02:43 <@deen> can't change ssh port without restarting server...
02:43 <@deen> works on all other distros i tried
02:53 <@deen> oops, now i locked me out entirely^^
02:53 < eeeee> lol
03:52 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
04:15 < Nimda> DDNet USA went back online!
05:09 <@deen> finally all servers back
05:10 <@deen> I made CAN and Brazil have their own databases so that ranks keep working when USA is down
05:10 <@deen> USA was the server to survive all ddos attacks before =/

10:03 <@heinrich5991> deen: maybe make ranks external on a server without gameservers?
10:03 <@heinrich5991> I don't know what load the db server is expected to have, but if it's not too much I could check whether I could host it
10:03 <@heinrich5991> (or someone else.)
10:10 < eeeee> heinrich5991: you'll just get urself ddosed :)
10:10 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: as I understand it, the server isn't publicly visible?
10:11 <@EastByte> indeed
10:11 < eeeee> well yeah sure
10:11 < eeeee> unless the attackers can somehow figure whos hosting it, perhaps because you mentioned that in some publicly logged channel
10:11 <@EastByte> like this one?
10:11 < eeeee> :\)
10:12 < eeeee> but fear not for i know the correct way to solve this
10:12 < eeeee> we just have to put the ranks in the cloud!
10:12 <@heinrich5991> I could just rent a server for explicitely this :)
10:13 <@heinrich5991> but before the kids haven't gone for this server explicitely
10:20 <@EastByte> 40gbit/s attacks are quite heavy
10:20 <@EastByte> and from what I know the attackers aren't really experienced
10:21 <@EastByte> so how can they do that without fearing about being sued
10:21 <@EastByte> recklessness?
10:22 < eeeee> idk, i guess would be kinda hard to make the police actually do shit about them unless the attack some govt websites or banks or sth
10:22 <@EastByte> iirc they told they are using their own botnet
10:24 <@EastByte> isn't that criminal enough?
10:24 <@EastByte> I mean how many infected systems to they need for 40gbit bandwidth
10:24 < eeeee> i think should be considerable damage for it to be criminal
10:26 < eeeee> idk, it would be kind of interesting if some hoster wrote up some details about the attack. they can estimate number of different ips, their ciscos keep track of that
10:27 <@EastByte> speaking of, deen should create a network dump next time
10:27 <@EastByte> maybe their attack changed
10:27 < eeeee> also it's entirely possible that they just pay someone $$$ to rent 4x10gbit servers for like five minutes and call that "botnet"
10:28 <@EastByte> yea, we have a chatlog were one of the attacks said where you can obtain high bandwidth dedicated servers with ip spoofing ability
10:29 <@EastByte> and that was quite cheap iirc
10:29 <@EastByte> attackers*
10:29 < eeeee> so they're prolly just using that
10:29 < eeeee> 40gbit botnet would be very surprising
10:29 <@EastByte> yea but we had attacks on different vectors
10:30 <@EastByte> the http flooding was definitly caused by a botnet
10:30 < eeeee> you might be able to get 40gbit out of dns ampl but that's hardly a botnet
10:32 < eeeee> man i feel like instead of spending our time enjoing the game we're gonna become the leading ddos mitigation experts soon
10:33 <@EastByte> sure^^
10:34 <@EastByte> amplification attacks weren't a problem at ovh
10:35 <@EastByte> but in frankfurt there only is a limited bandwidth
10:35 <@EastByte> the big amplification attacks are strong enough
10:35 < eeeee> limited bw isnt the biggest issue tho
10:35 < eeeee> the issue is that hoster blackholes it for 4 hrs
10:35 <@EastByte> because it's too much traffic for them
10:36 < eeeee> yeah no shit
10:36 < eeeee> but that makes the attack way more effective
10:37 <@heinrich5991> yea
10:38 <@heinrich5991> it means 5min attack results in 4h downtime
10:39 < eeeee> where is ger hosted, again
10:39 < eeeee> nfoservers?
10:40 <@EastByte> yea
10:41 <@EastByte> they don't really advertise their ddos protection but it is well suited for gameservers
10:42 < eeeee> i wonder if all vps ips get blackholed or only the one attacked
10:43 <@EastByte> definitly only the ip being attacked
10:43 < eeeee> we can do some rerouting trick then
10:44 <@EastByte> let's fall back to the complicated soltuions again :)
10:44 <@EastByte> deen likes that
10:44 < eeeee> it's not even THAT complicated
10:44 < eeeee> but it's totally gonna work! but only with ddnet client...
10:44 <@EastByte> some time before I told xrothx to buy a second ip for testing purposes
10:46 <@EastByte> "definitly only the ip being attacked", well it might also be that all the vps simply is removed from network
10:46 <@EastByte> -all
10:47 < eeeee> that would be much harder to handle
10:47 <@EastByte> sure
12:52 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
12:53 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!

15:35 <@heinrich5991> deen: ddnet question: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=112906#p112906
16:47 < CookieMichal> deen: http://ddnet.tw/maps/twwebgl.js line 130: '$("#cnvs")' replace with '$(document)'. It will fix bug, when you don't hold mouse button, but map moves.
16:49 <@deen> CookieMichal: there are more lines like this?
16:49 < CookieMichal> deen: What do you mean?
16:49 <@deen> a few lines above and below
16:50 < CookieMichal> no need to change them
16:50 <@deen> ok, thanks
17:20 < CookieMichal> deen: Just found out that $(window).on("blur mouseup", will work better than $(document).on("mouseup", Replace please :)
17:22 <@deen> there is no .on("mouseup"
17:23 < CookieMichal> sorry, I meant $(document).mouseup(
17:23 <@deen> i don'T know javascript
17:23 <@deen> no idea how to change it^^
17:23 < CookieMichal> Line 130 Should look like this: $(window).on("blur mouseup", function(e) {
17:23 < CookieMichal> =)
17:24 <@deen> done
17:24 < CookieMichal> Cool :)
17:28 <@deen> CookieMichal: now make it work with touchpad
17:28 <@deen> ehm, touchscreen it's called I think
17:28 < CookieMichal> I am working on it now :D
17:28 <@deen> great
20:59 < CookieMichal> deen: Added touch support :) Here's the file
20:59 < CookieMichal> https://gist.github.com/CookieMichal/0b710f57f187ccebf300#file-twwebgl-js-L151
20:59 <@deen> CookieMichal: no additional js files necessary? nice
21:01 <@deen> CookieMichal: if you want to keep working on it: make the background stay at the same size when zooming out
21:02 <@deen> and make clipping and animations work :P
21:02 < CookieMichal> I will try ^^
21:02 < CookieMichal> btw modify HTML file like there: https://gist.github.com/CookieMichal/226fa80e8461a1977d81
21:06  * CookieMichal slaps deen around a bit with a large fishbot
21:27 < CookieMichal> I smell DDoS on DDNet GER
21:34 <@deen> hm?
23:11 < CookieMichal> deen: Make that, when player in locked team used /pause and someone else kills (all), he will automatically resume, so he can respawn instantly
23:13 < eeeee> y u no make yourself
23:13 < CookieMichal> cuz Im 2 lazy 2 test all the C++ code
23:14 < CookieMichal> aka idk how
23:14 < eeeee> so you like js code more?
23:14 < CookieMichal> Yep
23:15 < eeeee> but do you even webgl?
23:15 < eeeee> i could use some pr0 tips with my project
23:15 < CookieMichal> with three.js
23:15 < CookieMichal> it makes webgl rly ez
23:15 < CookieMichal> got canvas fallback
23:15 < eeeee> anyway could you consider http://tw.qwe123.info/d.html plx
23:16 < CookieMichal> *click*
23:16 < CookieMichal> o.0
23:17 < CookieMichal> Don't have time now
23:18 < CookieMichal> Cya tomorrow :)
23:18 < eeeee> kk
23:48 < Axomar> Deen r u there?
