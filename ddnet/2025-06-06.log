00:17 < bridge> <12944qwerty> @pioooooo noticed you worked on the afk command, do you mind if I continue on it and steal some of your changes?
00:19 < bridge> <gorp_tw> @12944qwerty my preference is the same command, idk why there's a player argument
00:19 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah
00:20 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i see actually zero value in using telecursor in any other way than X.5 increments
00:20 < bridge> <12944qwerty> it probably should have been if teleport is supposed to have player name but not cursor and tc to have cursor but not playername
00:20 < bridge> <gorp_tw> idk.why it was ever done
00:20 < bridge> <gorp_tw> if you need precision, they would be using tpxy anyway
00:21 < bridge> <gorp_tw> if anything, the argument should be "noclip"
00:21 < bridge> <gorp_tw> for if you accidentally tp to a solid tile, and it casts a ray to that pos and gives you the last air position
00:22 < bridge> <gorp_tw> makes it easier to use quickly
00:22 < bridge> <gorp_tw> teleporting with chat commands to any solid tile should be invalid in all contexts but meh
00:22 < bridge> <gorp_tw> should be rcon only for that stuff
00:23 < bridge> <gorp_tw> unless there's some use for that where u buffer hook on dummy in a solid tile then teleport out
00:23 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i know ive done that
00:23 < bridge> <gorp_tw> if its not possible to reach them
00:24 < bridge> <gorp_tw> or I guess some weird weapon usage idk, someone might have other examples of why solid teleport would be useful
00:24 < bridge> <gorp_tw> in /practice at least it should be not possible IMO
00:26 < bridge> <gorp_tw> telecursor or telecursor 0 (falsy) should do X.5 tp only, with raycast
00:26 < bridge> <gorp_tw> telecursor 1 should do X.5 only but allow solid tp
00:26 < bridge> <gorp_tw> telecursor 2 is precise position and also allow solid (feel free to argue it :P)
00:27 < bridge> <12944qwerty> wdym by solid tp
00:27 < bridge> <12944qwerty> or feel solid
00:27 < bridge> <gorp_tw> to a solid tile
00:27 < bridge> <gorp_tw> hookable unhookable
00:27 < bridge> <gorp_tw> its not possible in gameplay so in /practice it has no use IMO
00:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> maybe there's a 3rd mode too, where tp to solids is just not handled
00:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> ignores the request
00:30 < bridge> <gorp_tw> you could also move this to a client setting but, we hate those
00:31 < bridge> <kebscs> i would say we hate extra command options too
00:31 < bridge> <kebscs> simple tele cursor command and u want 3 modes for it
00:31 < bridge> <gorp_tw> gg
00:31 < bridge> <kebscs> who ever going to use it 😂
00:31 < bridge> <gorp_tw> just dont bind the mode u dont want lol
00:31 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont use binds
00:32 < bridge> <kebscs> ./tc easy enough
00:32 < bridge> <gorp_tw> tct is small
00:32 < bridge> <gorp_tw> if u need it ergonomic
00:34 < bridge> <kebscs> tct?
00:34 < bridge> <gorp_tw> telecursor tile
00:35 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i think client setting is better. you could specify 1 for .5 and 2 for also ignoring solid tp dest
00:35 < bridge> <gorp_tw> default 0, backwards compatible
00:36 < bridge> <gorp_tw> then u can apply the setting to tele and tc
00:37 < bridge> <gorp_tw> cl_ is not accurate though. the server handles it ultimately
00:39 < bridge> <gorp_tw> `tele_command_behavior`
00:41 < bridge> <gorp_tw> on client join, it sends this flag to the server, and a supporting server can respect this flag and handle the tele commands appropriately. it should be resent when it is changed in the client though which is probably normal for stuff like this
00:42 < bridge> <gorp_tw> server state is gross tho
00:43 < bridge> <12944qwerty> @pioooooo noticed you worked on the afk command, do you mind if I continue on it and steal some of your changes?
00:43 < bridge> <12944qwerty> tested your code, not sure why it got abandoned? looks like it works perfectly fine?)
00:45 < bridge> <gorp_tw> nah sorry it really should be an argument xD
00:45 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i don't like state
00:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the client should be able to say where it wants to go
00:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> as in coords
00:45 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> then the client can do whatever the fuck it wants
00:45 < bridge> <gorp_tw> do you mean like
00:46 < bridge> <gorp_tw> a cl_ to intercept tc commands and translate them to approximate tpxy ones?
00:46 < bridge> <gorp_tw> that COULD work actually but its confusing
00:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well i just generally want to be able to control state completley
00:46 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> for practice reasons
00:49 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but you can? with tpxy? but I want things to be precise for imprecise methods, conditionally
00:49 < bridge> <gorp_tw> specifically for tc
00:50 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i think it has to be f1 only sadly cus it has to turn it into the appropriate commanf
00:50 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i think it has to be f1 only sadly cus it has to turn it into the appropriate command
00:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why are there seperate test and practice commands
00:51 < bridge> <gorp_tw> idfk
00:51 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and why is clangd broken
00:51 < bridge> <12944qwerty> exactly,
00:51 < bridge> <12944qwerty> I don't know what coords are where I want to tp to, but using my cursor I can snap to that tile. But sometimes I may want to be on the edge of a tile instead, which is where i'll use the imprecise tc
00:51 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i just like his idea, whatever method would actually be considered by devs
00:52 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yeah dude I test maps all the time and its so fucking annoying
00:52 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i totally get it
00:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe tp to nearest safe would work
00:53 < bridge> <gorp_tw> separate command would be fine I guess but bleh we know how that goes
00:53 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe tp to nearest air would work
00:53 < bridge> <gorp_tw> why is tc even a thing
00:53 < bridge> <gorp_tw> just turn tele into tc coords if you're not in spec
00:54 < bridge> <gorp_tw> teleporting to your own position is pointless if not for some speed reset
00:54 < bridge> <12944qwerty> what if you want to tp to freeze area
00:54 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> then dont use it
00:54 < bridge> <gorp_tw> but if we could bind speed it's not a problem
00:55 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i think its only bad for solids really
00:55 < bridge> <gorp_tw> getting stuck in a solid tile just barely when u try to tele rly nicely feels so ass
00:56 < bridge> <gorp_tw> its like, yes but you know what I want to do xd
00:57 < bridge> <gorp_tw> what does tc via f1 even do if you're in spec?
00:57 < bridge> <gorp_tw> is your cursor considered centered on the player?
00:59 < bridge> <gorp_tw> or maybe its spec position.. idk stuff is confusing
00:59 < bridge> <gorp_tw> wish it was one command
01:01 < bridge> <gorp_tw> OH SHIT you're qwerty XDDD I thought you were an even newer player, what's up dude
01:05 < bridge> <12944qwerty> lmaoo
01:07 < bridge> <gorp_tw> i remember u trying to learn some tech on like one of ur first days and I was like aight this guy is not a USA rq risk
01:07 < bridge> <gorp_tw> addicted now
01:12 < bridge> <12944qwerty> im a pro now fr 😎
01:17 < bridge> <gorp_tw> sry im being a spaz rn, i just had like a ton of coffee on an empty stomach
02:22 < bridge> <louis> testing commands should slowly be moved to practice commands imo
02:22 < bridge> <louis> needing rcon to test a map kinda feels like bad behavior anyways
02:23 < bridge> <louis> i tink implement /tpcursortile to tp to the center of the block you are on or aiming at, idk
02:23 < bridge> <louis> might be a better solution
02:25 < bridge> <louis> why, its useful to get across a closed map
02:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well my first thought was, this is exact same behaviour
02:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i looked at the implementation and it sucks ass
02:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i then thought what you thought
02:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why do you need rcon... for this
02:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> theres only a few commands seen in test which arent in practice
02:28 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> some which are weirdly named, i would like to take the opertunity to rename them
02:35 < bridge> <louis> i think all is missing is /up /down /left /right
02:36 < bridge> <louis> and i would change how /invincible works with buffs and powerups
03:05 < bridge> <pioooooo> not at all, go for what you want. It's abandoned bc maintainers want to add it in the player flag and what I did was a chat command
03:32 < bridge> <gorp_tw> yeah i guess you're right
03:51 < bridge> <Ewan> u fix yet or no
03:51 < bridge> <12944qwerty> Yeah i reinstalled it and it worked
03:52 < bridge> <Ewan> huge
04:08 < bridge> <gorp_tw> maybe teletile and teletilecursor are better names
04:38 < bridge> <12944qwerty> does that mean the client chooses when it's afk?
04:38 < bridge> <12944qwerty> what's player flag I can look at to see what that's like
04:45 < bridge> <12944qwerty> what is `CNetObj_Character`and why can't i find it definition anywhere lol
04:46 < bridge> <12944qwerty> did you use vscode for editing or was that someone else
04:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i do at work
04:47 < bridge> <Ewan> Not for cpp tho
04:51 < bridge> <12944qwerty> oh, the clangd extension isn't finding some paths for some reason even though they exist in the same directory as ones they have found
04:51 < bridge> <12944qwerty> weird
04:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> really weird
04:57 < bridge> <Ewan> which paths
05:08 < bridge> <12944qwerty> namely `#include <game/client/component.h>`
05:09 < bridge> <12944qwerty> inside of that it's `#include <engine/input.h>`
05:11 < bridge> <12944qwerty> hm all the way in it's cstdint
05:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> Cmake .. -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 in your build directory
05:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> This generates a commands_json file, so clang can learn where stuff is basically
05:31 < bridge> <meloƞ> `cmake .. -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1` in your build directory
05:32 < bridge> <12944qwerty> would that work because clangd is warning me in the code, not in the build dir
05:32 < bridge> <12944qwerty> and how would clangd know that the commands_json file exists
05:33 < bridge> <meloƞ> It's predefined
05:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> From their docs:
05:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
05:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> By default, clangd will assume your code is built as clang some_file.cc, and you’ll probably get spurious errors about missing #included files, etc. There are a couple of ways to fix this.
05:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
05:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> compile_commands.json#
05:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> This file provides compile commands for every source file in a project. It is usually generated by tools.
05:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
05:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> clangd will look in the parent directories of the files you edit looking for it, and also in subdirectories named build/. For example, if editing $SRC/gui/window.cpp, we search in $SRC/gui/, $SRC/gui/build/, $SRC/, $SRC/build/, …
05:34 < bridge> <meloƞ> ```
05:35 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah it's not finding it for some reason then
05:35 < bridge> <meloƞ> Or maybe you're missing standard headers?
05:35 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah it's the cxxxx libraries
05:35 < bridge> <12944qwerty> cstdint, ctime, etc
05:36 < bridge> <meloƞ> Create a new file and include iostream and save it, does clang throw an error?
05:37 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah 'iostream' file not foundclang(pp_file_not_found)
05:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> You're on ucrt rn right?
05:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
05:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> Install ucrt64-w64-x86_64-gcc
05:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
05:37 < bridge> <meloƞ> Or something similar (you need to look it up I don't know rn)
05:37 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yup
05:38 < bridge> <12944qwerty> already isntalled
05:38 < bridge> <12944qwerty> (mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc)
05:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> did you add mingw64/ucrt64/include
05:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
05:38 < bridge> <meloƞ> To your path?
05:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> did you add msys2/ucrt64/include
05:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> 
05:39 < bridge> <meloƞ> To your path?
05:40 < bridge> <12944qwerty> no, but adding it made no difference
05:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> Did you fully restart vs code ?
05:40 < bridge> <12944qwerty> the game compiles, it's just the extension not working to make things easier
05:40 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah
05:40 < bridge> <meloƞ> Hmm, okay one last thing to try
05:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> Open up the vscode .workspace file under the /other subdirectory
05:41 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i did
05:41 < bridge> <12944qwerty> that's what i've been doing
05:41 < bridge> <meloƞ> :feelsbadman:
05:41 < bridge> <12944qwerty> does the cmake extensions not being installed make a difference
05:42 < bridge> <meloƞ> Shouldn't
05:42 < bridge> <12944qwerty> wait should clangd be installed by ucrt or standalone
05:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> preferably via ucrt
05:43 < bridge> <meloƞ> Your entire environment should preferably come from ucrt
05:43 < bridge> <12944qwerty> ucrt doesn't have a clangd
05:43 < bridge> <12944qwerty> error: package 'mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-clangd' was not found
05:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> Clang-tools-extra
05:44 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah just discovered that lmao
05:44 < bridge> <12944qwerty> not a ucrt one though
05:44 < bridge> <meloƞ> :nouis:
05:45 < bridge> <12944qwerty> it exists for mingw but not ucrt
05:46 < bridge> <12944qwerty> wtf
05:46 < bridge> <12944qwerty> spot the difference

05:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> :brownbear: :KEKW:
05:47 < bridge> <meloƞ> There has to be one.. right??
05:49 < bridge> <12944qwerty> it works
05:49 < bridge> <12944qwerty> somewhat
05:49 < bridge> <12944qwerty> clang-tidy is making a mess of red lines now though
05:50 < bridge> <meloƞ> how so
05:51 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i assume it's because clang-format-10 doesn't exist
05:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380393766711591076/image.png?ex=6843b760&is=684265e0&hm=4feb60d0cc2a78e66dc889f033a858ce9e8527162276870a5a0ae6205bf19a22&
05:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> it's literally just case styling all over
05:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> clang-format does exist but clang-format-10 doesnt
05:53 < bridge> <meloƞ> yeah i recommend grabbing a static library from https://pypi.org/project/clang-format/10.0.1/
05:54 < bridge> <12944qwerty> shouldn't i be putting it in msys2 or something though
05:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> i mean, just put the binary in msys2/ucrt and call it `clang-format-10` so vscode can find it
05:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> :p
05:54 < bridge> <meloƞ> yeah i recommend grabbing a static binary from https://pypi.org/project/clang-format/10.0.1/
05:56 < bridge> <12944qwerty> the clang-format that does exist doesn't seem to be found by the extensino though
05:56 < bridge> <12944qwerty> weird
05:57 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i have it in path too
05:58 < bridge> <12944qwerty> it still has the error even though the clang-format is being used
06:07 < bridge> <12944qwerty> the wheels don't install for the python one
06:08 < bridge> <pioooooo> It's generated from python script so you have to look for it inside build dir. But since you have set up clangd I assume it can find it for you
06:08 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah clangd finally found it
06:13 < bridge> <12944qwerty> oh well i can turn off format for now
06:32 < bridge> <12944qwerty> oh it wasn't format extension, it was part of clangd
06:38 < bridge> <Ewan> thats not how the path works
06:39 < bridge> <Ewan> only executables are relevant in that
06:39 < bridge> <Ewan> gcc includes the system locations by default
06:40 < bridge> <Ewan> /usr/local/bin :feelsbadman:
06:40 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnet uses an old version of clang format that doesn't really exist in package manager anymore
06:40 < bridge> <Ewan> yes, i know. amazing
06:48 < bridge> <12944qwerty> nono the problem is that clang-tidy is erroring
06:48 < bridge> <12944qwerty> not clang-format
07:19 < bridge> <Ewan> what does it say idk
07:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i replied to the wrong msg
08:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jxsl13 Yo, do you use `air`(https://github.com/air-verse/air) tool? For some reason sometimes I can't Ctrl + C out of it. I tried to add logs to the code and it looks like sometimes it doesn't write to `sigs` channel https://github.com/air-verse/air/blob/6ba3c07ce640f1c79ada44c41b7484ddbec893e8/main.go#L108-L111 -.- Maybe you know why it could be the case?
08:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> at first glance I don't see anything, other than the graceful shutdown code not using signal.NotifyContext and os.Exit being called outside of the main function.
08:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> not sure why there is no signal in the sigs channel, tho
09:10 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how to even debug it :feelsbadman:
09:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> start app in debugger, send sigint signal to app?
10:34 < bridge> <01000111g> @yrrr_ help him
10:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> something is definitely happening
10:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380469317489000489/image.png?ex=6843fdbd&is=6842ac3d&hm=bb2804adadc8cadf829d4f7246b2d6c5552a32b2e82cf4b3dd3816393f9cee96&
10:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> well, there is a Go debugger called delve, which integrates into vs code
10:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i use neovim btw
10:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> probably works with that as well, but it's more work, I'd guess, as usual

11:55 < bridge> <yrrr_> @12944qwerty clangd is a bit goofy with msys2. you need to specifiy in some vscode-clangd config file that you are using the mingw toolchain. when i get home i can send how i fixed it for myself.

12:02 < bridge> <whxisme> @patiga is it correct database?
12:10 < bridge> <yrrr_> you only need vscode clangd plugin for it to work and i think you dont need to instally any clangd from msys2 repo
12:13 < bridge> <whxisme> I've read the issue on this issue, but it's still not entirely clear to me how it relates to command/power access rights.
12:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> This is not related to power access rights
12:19 < bridge> <whxisme> ok
12:19 < bridge> <whxisme> don't you know something about this?
12:19 < bridge> <whxisme> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380491402533670922/image.png?ex=6844124e&is=6842c0ce&hm=cce8c13793650b77b96fc8fea8fe03f904110533957e5058eadc7ae93d3a64d7&
12:25 < bridge> <meloƞ> Das okay :kek:
12:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @jxsl13 I tried to reproduce this in tty but I couldn't so it's probably not go's fault but something from alacritty, zsh or tmux 😐
13:20 < bridge> <0xfaulty> Is any chance to merge #10098 until next release?
13:20 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10098
13:30 < bridge> <Assa> if 10098 get's merged, we should update the entities, as the 45° angle doesn't make sense for mapping anymore
13:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why are rcon commands "temporary"
13:32 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> having them not temporary requires they havea  function, but setting it to nullptr (std::functions can also be empty) would work but is not "type" safe (its not garunteed anymore that the function member isnt null) but you can just add a check for that
13:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> all commands which are temp registered are cfgflag_server
13:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> so deleting them is okay
13:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its a bit scary deleting char*s tho
13:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but no one should be adding cfgflags_server
13:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> apart fromt he server
13:47 < bridge> <kebscs> why?
13:49 < bridge> <kebscs> if you look closely the tile image matches how the weapon is flipped
13:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Unlikely, since we still have open TODOs for prediction that are more important and we already have many features for this release
13:50 < bridge> <kebscs> the pr is ready just needs a review
13:50 < bridge> <kebscs> and i feel like there isnt many features this release
13:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 10098 has no _accepted_ issue anyway
13:54 < bridge> <kebscs> a 5 year issue i would say is accepted
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> no
13:56 < bridge> <kebscs> then add labels or close old issues
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yes
13:59 < bridge> <kebscs> nvm it does have labels
13:59 < bridge> <Assa> yes but the image itself doesn't match
14:01 < bridge> <kebscs> what image
14:03 < bridge> <whxisme> help pls. i need to get access for command /power rainbow. who can i give access to me
14:03 < bridge> <whxisme> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380517346061455430/image.png?ex=68442a78&is=6842d8f8&hm=7c7866234f7c4811a36c633fad6f69fc1279ee4b5f6b3a8ba08c044e1e4e7ade&
14:03 < bridge> <whxisme> what i need to write in "Name"
14:03 < bridge> <whxisme> i wrote nickname but /power still doesn't work
14:14 < bridge> <whxisme> @patiga dont you know?
14:14 < bridge> <patiga> I don't know, sorry
14:15 < bridge> <whxisme> 😦
14:17 < bridge> <whxisme> Can you just assume
14:17 < bridge> <patiga> try a 1 in the rainbow column
14:18 < bridge> <whxisme> i need to write just my ingame nickname in column NAME?
14:24 < bridge> <patiga> probably
14:27 < bridge> <gorp_tw> dont expect us to know anything about some mod, better to ask the dev that made it or someone who hosts it
14:28 < bridge> <gorp_tw> otherwise we're guessing
14:42 < bridge> <zelamusinc> hi,im developing a player stat viewer site called TeeViewer,but i started yesterday so its far from finished,im using api's of ddstats.tw and status.tw.if i give them credits and make a good site,will you guys,ddnet devs host the site,or at least give a domain/subdomain?
15:11 < bridge> <kebscs> ddstats.tw and status.tw arent even associated with ddnet
15:16 < bridge> <kebscs> and ddstats.tw uses the ddnet's database, which is openly available
15:17 < bridge> <kebscs> its better to base your site on official db too, the unofficial website can just close if the creator feels like it
15:17 < bridge> <zelamusinc> but it processes the data doesnt it
15:17 < bridge> <zelamusinc> right
15:17 < bridge> <zelamusinc> thanks
15:51 < bridge> <whxisme> i wanna to give power to player with nickname claw on my ddnet server with teemod opengores. what i need to write in collumn Name? player ingame name?
15:51 < bridge> <whxisme> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1380544567077634059/image.png?ex=684443d2&is=6842f252&hm=5f5db4ac7164b76b9fbda2b3a6cbe194c9a19b05029d6757c824f90c031f5554&

15:53 < bridge> <kebscs> name is name
15:53 < bridge> <kebscs> other columns 1 - enabled 0 -disabled
15:53 < bridge> <whxisme> name in game?
15:54 < bridge> <kebscs> probablty
15:54 < bridge> <kebscs> probably
15:54 < bridge> <kebscs> check the source
15:54 < bridge> <whxisme> idk, id doesnt work
15:54 < bridge> <whxisme> i write command /power rainbow but server still answering that i haven't got permission to use this power
15:55 < bridge> <kebscs> debug then
15:56 < bridge> <kebscs> idk if anyone here ever used that mod
17:29 < bridge> <zelamusinc> what about the subdomain? is it possible
17:33 < bridge> <kebscs> idk i dont own these domains, and im not a ddnet admin
17:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet domains are managed by a player called sp someone
17:53 < bridge> <zelamusinc> how can i contact him
18:03 < bridge> <zelamusinc> looking at the mentions of sp someone,doesnt look good😬
18:13 < bridge> <louis> @zelamusinc youre better off contributing to ddnet-web or smth we alr have
18:13 < bridge> <louis> you saying this makes it seem like you just want to make a css wrapper for ddstats.tw or the like
18:16 < bridge> <louis> the current website already shows stats, so a subdomain wouldn't make sense
18:16 < bridge> <louis> if you just need someone to host the website i think a lot of ppl in this chat would help you out though
18:23 < bridge> <zelamusinc> thanks
18:24 < bridge> <zelamusinc> im thinking about merging the 2 sites,status.tw and ddstats.tw,they both have uniuqe features
18:25 < bridge> <acrolol> seconde time since 27/06/2024 asking.
18:25 < bridge> <acrolol> Can we create a /teampoints to see the global points of our team
18:26 < bridge> <kebscs> combined?
18:26 < bridge> <acrolol> yes
18:26 < bridge> <kebscs> if not it would spam the chat too much with a big team
18:26 < bridge> <zelamusinc> if i can,ofc i will,i tried the use the same color scheme as the ddnet.org but the design doesnt match,ddnet.org is a bit more oldschool and crispier,mine is a bit more modern,animations and rounded corners etc.
18:26 < bridge> <acrolol> combined
18:26 < bridge> <kebscs> combined has little to no use imo
18:27 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> is this windows defender report known?

18:27 < bridge> <acrolol> i like the idee tbh
18:27 < bridge> <zelamusinc> chinese by whis ahh report
18:28 < bridge> <zelamusinc> its better to google it and look on forums dedicated to this
18:28 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> If not then I assume the guys PC is just infected.

18:29 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> Has anyone reported it for 19.2.1
18:29 < bridge> <learath2> Run it thru virustotal if you want to check
18:29 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> I don't have it
18:29 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> It's just a screenshot
18:29 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> And I'm in bed lol
18:29 < bridge> <learath2> I remember hearing about someone complaining recently
18:29 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> Good to know
18:30 < bridge> <zelamusinc> imagine complaining about an open source game as a virus
18:31 < bridge> <kebscs> can also submit here <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission>
18:32 < bridge> <kebscs> not sure how well that works tho
18:33 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> I just told them to add it to exceptions for now. I did warn them only do that if they've not done any banking on that machine before.:nouis:

18:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
18:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML
18:54 < bridge> <robyt3> It's not detected for me or with virustotal. Maybe the heuristic detection failed because the file was still being downloaded.
18:55 < bridge> <TsFreeeeeeeeeddie> It's also possible for actual virus to infect it I assume?
18:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems unlikely that it would be detected for only this file then and also by a very unreliable detection
19:15 < bridge> <freakin_lime> Same for me

19:15 < bridge> <freakin_lime> cant start ddnet after patch
19:28 < bridge> <melon> will it pinpoint you which file or is it just the .exe?
19:29 < bridge> <melon> is it just the .exe?
19:30 < bridge> <zelamusinc> i'll test
19:33 < bridge> <zelamusinc> can you press it then show which file its flagging
19:47 < bridge> <soulyvevo> :troll:
20:00 < bridge> <Dreamless> I'll pile up on another.
20:00 < bridge> <Dreamless>

20:05 < bridge> <learath2> Can you run it thru virustotal to make sure no one else picked us up?
20:06 < bridge> <learath2> I think it's our self-replacing executable that's really pissing off these machine learning algorithms
20:06 < bridge> <Assa> had the same issue, this is a false positive from microsoft machine learning bs
20:06 < bridge> <Dreamless> just the .exe file?
20:06 < bridge> <learath2> Also the half italian half chinese detection is bizarre, how did that happen? 😄
20:06 < bridge> <learath2> Aye
20:07 < bridge> <zelamusinc> its country based?lmfao doesnt detect to me
20:07 < bridge> <zelamusinc> thats german
20:07 < bridge> <Dreamless> my pc has some weird settings, It was some shenanigans to read the chinese characters, but I also live in italy and had some weird localization settings that I didn't bother too much
20:08 < bridge> <learath2> I am 10000% sure that's Italian in Dreamless' image

20:09 < bridge> <zelamusinc> https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission
20:10 < bridge> <Dreamless> idk if it's relevant, but I opened the game, joined a server, and after 5-10s it kicked me out, deleting the file
20:12 < bridge> <learath2> The website didn't work 11/10
20:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But why is it chinese at the same time
20:14 < bridge> <learath2> I18n moment
20:15 < bridge> <learath2> Probably the labels are built into the program and use the windows language, and the description text is from an api that uses geoip
20:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Possible
20:18 < bridge> <Dreamless> here

22:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> how ya doin
22:30 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> the intention is making scripts look prettier rather than adding functionality
22:30 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> eg not executing dummy stuff without dummy connected
22:30 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> i cant see anything you cant do without this and typing in f1
22:31 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> ehh
22:31 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> idk what my line is
22:31 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> but it isnt crossed by any stretch
22:34 < bridge> <kebscs> windows defender isnt on virustotal
22:39 < bridge> <Ewan> idk
23:35 < bridge> <robyt3> Seems like they removed it, I'm pretty sure it was available before
23:47 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> (location is limited to 8 cardinal directions, its for infclass callouts, which kaffine has allowed)
23:49 < bridge> <12944qwerty> Invalid case style for member 'm_Last_KickVote' (fix available)clang-tidyreadability-identifier-naming
23:51 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> m_LastKickVote
23:51 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah, I had installed the server onto msys2 and then pointed the extension to it. I've stopped using compile_commands.json though, that wasn't the problem. it was just the clangd server not being on msys2.
23:51 < bridge> <12944qwerty> When I installed the clangd extension on vsc, it automatically installed it's own clangd. However, it gave the error for not finding the stdlibs. When I switched to msys2 clangd, it found those stdlibs easily.
23:51 < bridge> <12944qwerty> i'm using ucrt64 instead of mingw32 ,would that make a difference
23:51 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> if you push to a public github repository, actiosn will run the checks for you
23:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> yeah but I'd rather have it give me a green checkmark at first go instead of me having to go back and fix
23:52 < bridge> <12944qwerty> besides, clang-tidy red errors are all over the place making it hard to read
23:52 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> you can always force push over repeated fixes
23:52 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> if you want a readable commit history
23:53 < bridge> <12944qwerty> nah, idc about that
23:54 < bridge> <Bunny (dum dum)> you can always go back and fix it when you do
