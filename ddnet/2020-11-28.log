12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do we already have a CI check for variable naming?
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki no, due to too many wrong variables names
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we could introduce a check that it can only decrease I guess
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen splitting the debug info after the fact might require less tooling
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 any idea how to do it on Linux + Windows?
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> another article https://edgarluque.com/blog/code-conventions-in-ddnet :yoo:
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki no rss/atom feed?
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I have to make it
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> My blog looks same but before it was made with python scripts now its full rust
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> So i gotta make a a atom generator in rust
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES_WTFEyes:642733839973613598>
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So your blog generation takes 0.1 s instead of 0.5 s now thanks to Rust? 😄
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It's also memory safe ☕
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well before it was a fully static web, now its backed with a db
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I plan on adding comments and stuff
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It uses only 12mb of ram according to systemd
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> memory safe isn't really interesting for a static site generator, no?
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but for an internet facing website, maybe
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but there's a lot more to dynamic website protection
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> waiting for the XSS to roll in 😛
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Python is also memory safe
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh true, that also
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Is it also thread safe?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> It's easy to be memory safe when you don't care about absolute performance, like Python and other scripting langauges
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I guess
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> java is also memory/thread safe 😉
13:05 <+ChillerDragon> is it threadsafe?
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (not a scripting language)
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It just takes the whole ram
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No more ram to leak
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ☕
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> memleaks are considered safe in rust
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Python has the GIL, so using multiple threads is barely possible
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only if all the threads wait for IO or call C functions that release the GIL
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yeah i read a article about that
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > In CPython, the global interpreter lock, or GIL, is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. The GIL prevents race conditions and ensures thread safety.
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mem::forget
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Python powers django
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Used by a lot
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES_WTFEyes:642733839973613598>
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think instagram uses django
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://info.ddnet.tw/info?name=deen is also created with Python and I'm not worried about performance. Always < 10 ms and that's all spent in the database anyway
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's just generating one list, right? ^^
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes 🙂
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Well i used rust cuz i enjoy it and find it fun, i also learn, my blog will never have a traffic that makes rust speed matter anyway 😛
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> never say never
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Chile server is running with emergency power generator, electricity has been cut off for some reason 😄
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> At least they're prepared, not the first time they had such issues:
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > The autonomy of the Generator is 27 hours with the current load and we can recharge hot fuel to continue for up to 12 days if necessary.
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oof
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hot fuel refill sounds dangerous. Watch the next update on the situation being they burned down the dc and we lost all data
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh, they say hot fuel refill
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise they could turn a generator off, refuel it, start it again and then go to the next generator
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> Dont touch strong weak
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @bajojajo wdym? is that just a random non-constructive reaction by someone who heard weak/strong?
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this smells like a sockpuppet to me tbh
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> maybe it's about strong/weak changing
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> @heinrich5991 there are maps to require save and change strong weak to even finish the maps
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @bajojajo check the issue
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > If we do still need a way to change weak/strong, provide it as a separate command.
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> Yea im saying we need :)
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, fine
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you give at least one example?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> Nope cuz those maps are mostly noname oldschools
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wait. any map finished in team0 can't fall into this category
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> theres one part on pentamine which makes the part 100x easier if u have strong
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> Yup
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cus u have to drag other thru some speeders, but if u have weak u need to do like some crazy shotgun bounce to add force
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> And on complex maps like justice, binary strong weak change is really needed
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> im sure there arent too many cases tho
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> It mostly hurts hard complex insane maps
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> Where strong weak change alot
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hard complex insane oldschool?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> Insane insane
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> Binary, justice1, justice2
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> Well binary has /spec, but u get the point
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> Players need a way to change strong weak
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> whose sockpuppet are you btw?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> are you circumventing a ban?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> your account raises all the red flags
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> Whats a sockpuppet
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> pretending to be someone else because you don't want to identify your main account or are banned on this server
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with your main account
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bajojajo> Im Wrzosik
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> kk
18:41 <+ChillerDragon>  :banhammer:
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill touch it 😊
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> is there a reason to not have unfreeze in the switch layer ? and please dont excuse it with not being used much
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> will not being used
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lets add 100 useless features
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> add switchable envelopes too plz
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and sound triggers
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not possible with vanilla
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> do people still play on vanilla :greenthing:
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> we even made 0.7 compat lately
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i dont understand how it wouldn't work for vanillaaa
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wouldn't that mean synchronized animations/sounds in general wouldn't work
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> synchronized animations are implemented in vanilla
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes please just let go of vanilla. especially after the steam release.  i want para x-y for layers not only groups. i want clipping with para and placeable like tiles
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i want para less than 1
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait would sounds be ok with vanilla tho?
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> sounds are only in ddnet
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cant we just add cool features and just make vanilla have some low-detail version of maps
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> ye ok never mind it keep being retarded i found a work around anyway...
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Sorah in general: not being used much is a good argument against a feature: there would be better things to spend time on. a feature isn't a one-time cost either, it has to maintained going forward
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum some stats on amount of vanilla players would be nice. if there are only a few ones playing, we could maybe drop it
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> cant you just take a look on the version numbers every now and then?
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, if you know how to do it, tell me the commands to run on the logs
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just wanted to check if there's something simple
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> when i was mod a few years back i could see everybodys version number on the server
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yea, but that doesn't give you the statistics for a whole day
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess you could check multimap or so
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll try going through the logs of today
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum I count 10,000 players with 0.6 clients and 1,000 players with 0.7 clients
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess at least the 1,000 with 0.7 clients likely don't have the ddnet client, about 9% of our player base
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what a bunch of fools 😠
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> some might be on fclient
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i guess we got more 0.7 when ddnet allowed 0.7 clients to join
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> 0.7 is best
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> maybe 0.7 community on ddrace isn't quite high
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> but gctf and zcatch community is active
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> also vanilla
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's at 9%, quite high IMO
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah 9% is a lot
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> well one day it should happen. maybe give them a loooong warning
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> but from those 9% maybe 0.5% is using modded client
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> like fclient or zillywoods
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd also guess that few players on 0.7 use modded clients
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but please don't make up percentages
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ye that 0.5% was rather a guess
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> in future ddnet will have three folders of maps
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> maps6
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> maps
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> maps7
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> if ddnet would move to 0.8
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> would it still have backwards compatibility?
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we'd have to add it
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though now that we know the differences well, it would be implemented more quickly
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> dang i think /roll would be good feature
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> seems very out of place
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> maybe if you made more of these and added them all at once :feelsamazingman:
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ddnet: suggesting::ddnet: 
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> place an option:flag_unk:  to choice what the skin:jaouis: ,  for players see it:poggers:   if them no have my skin:frozen: 
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3>  ( choice the default skin)
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can put whatever you want as your skins/default.png in your config direcotry
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> when other player will use skin that you dont have downloaded
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> this looks hard!
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> you wont see it
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> you will see it as default
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> so his suggestion is to be able to change default to something other
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> yeah i want choing default
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ye
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :ddnet: suggestion :ddnet: 
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> don't :twinbop:  use so many emojis 😱 when you write messages 🗣️ because it makes 🤹 what you write:nobot: hard to read 🍞
