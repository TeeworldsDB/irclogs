12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> would it be possible to add a NetStruct to data types? (e.g. similar to NetIntAny, NetArray, ...)
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> or, perhaps not a good idea to use anything recursive
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We seem to have an issue with how we linked libnotify
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> cmake succeeds when it's not installed
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we dont check it
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should, right?
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would be nicer yes
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Not Keks the given error for vulkan things not being found is also very meh
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what does it say?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://paste.pr0.tips/t7
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ahh i guess https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5076/commits/f595318b830653ca13f462e6949fbf80eb7b6860 fixes this
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't believe I've been using my computer at 800mhz, things compile so quickly now :3
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in 20 years
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i cant believe ive been using my computer at 800ghz, things compile so quickly now xd
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> too bad frequency isn't increasing anymore

15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> power wall hits hard
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> true story
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i want more single thread performance xd
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> now they throw more l1 cache to it and it works xxd
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> where is that from, i want more stats like that
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> performance related
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also for gpus xd
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hum, Hennessy & Patterson is a good source
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> its the biblio for system architect
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> its the bible for system architect
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> lol, i typed biblio instead of bible, phd really starts to consume me
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> too bad they stats always end in 2010
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/972857044115808256/unknown.png

15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> modern cpu are nowadays more dense in terms of power than a nuclear reactor
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and intel probs already beats the sun at this point xd
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hence the power wall, you can't cool them down efficiently
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> also dark silicon problem if you have ever heard of it
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> intel cryo cooler
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/972857503115251742/unknown.png
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cool by activly using electric energy
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/972857796687175740/unknown.png

15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> are you also facing such problems in your memory designs?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> partly, but not completely
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hence my phd about computing in memory directly because there is way less power density for the moment
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so obviously, this is not possible
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> faster memory = faster effective CPU, i am fine with that
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> actually, we would need to slow memory a lil bit, depend on the technology
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well each cycle is still becoming more efficient, so comparing clock speeds isn't always really fair
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if you get close to super conduction?
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and we can't compute anything there, mostly parallel stuff for AI or BLAS stuff
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it is because power scales with f²
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> heat must go somewhere, superconduction don't apply to semiconductor
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> with other materials?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> then it's a drastic technology change, we have nothing close in that matter
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe optronic might be a game changer
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but we still have a long way to go
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well yes, so it might actually be good that f isn't increasing anymore
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes i want my alien hardware
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> spintronic is also interesting in the way it works
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> in spintronic, the path (copper wire) is actually the gate
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> its quite weird, fucking quantum physic
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we can extract more performance while not having to increase the frequency it's a win, and if raw performance starts to stagnate we might finally get back to the golden age of optimization when people actually cared about writing nice code
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> win win 😛
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tru, it already happens a lot
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> script languages get c bindings for slow paths 😄
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, you cna't have more performance without more frequency or more parallelism
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hardware operators have already been quite optimized
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but there is still room
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> so we really need a technology shift
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well you can pipeline more, we most definitely can parallelise more
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> pipeline more --> more stalls when branching
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 15 stage is around the norm
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> --> more people care about writing nice branchless code --> I'm happy 😛
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> in 2005/2006 they had up to 40 stages and reverted because it was highly inefficient
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you cant write branchless code 😄
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, you can with predicated/conditional hardware operator
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not the norm in x86
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but that's what is used for GPU
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but we still have a bit of headroom for transistor sizes and for the overall gaps between the transistors(for logical units) & other components(memory controler etc)
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dont we?
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> interesting tab about simd extension:
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/972860260433920020/unknown.png
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, intel is still at 10nm, so they can go down up to 2 or 3nm, but they already took 10 years to industrialize their 10nm process
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 3 silicon atoms would be around 0.6-1nanometer
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> all we need
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> TSMC does sell 5 and 7nm now, but technology is slightly different and less efficient (performance wise) than intel's finfet technology
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think quantum fuckiness prevents us from going that low 😄
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> silicon is just the base die
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think the quantum effects are only the space between transistors not the transistors itself?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you need germanium, carbon and some more as well
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but tbh, who the fuck knows xd
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not especially well read in semi conductor technology, but if you go that small the uncertainty in the position of the electron starts being an issue
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and the fabrication process would be a mess
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> they already have huge problems to get a good yield from their wafer
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> like 50% are thrown out due to defects
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i pay my 2million bucks for 1 trillion fps
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> damn, 1ps per frame 😄
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fwiw, I'm not especially concerned about not getting more performance, I think we have plenty enough we are just wasting right now, if we don't get improvements for a while we'll just have to get smarter about our use of cycles
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i bet as soon as x86 is the reason for no more performance
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it dies faster than the industry can imagine rn xd
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> risc-v ftw !!
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but is risc really good in your argumentation?
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> more pipelined instructions = more effective performance
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so would it make sense to make more ccomplex instructions
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wouldn't*
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or better
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the longer the code runs inside the logic unit the better
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you can add extension to it, so not really a problem
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's what makes it interesting, you can specialize it following your needs
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean it kinda works out for apple
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but not as much as it should tbh
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> considering intel beats it with 10nm
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and m1 is a soc
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do you think a RISC processor can scale up in high power regions?
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (signle threaded ofc)
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> what do you mean by "high power regions"?
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> throw 100 watts against it and it runs better with like ok efficiency curve
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> basically what intel does
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> give it 5ghz instead of 4 and u have a bit more performance 😄
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> because risc is risc, you'll have linear scale up, but most complex computing would not benefit from it directly
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so another cisc design? or still prefer risc? D:
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i still prefer risc, it's easier to design 😄
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> hehe
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> easier to manage as well for the state machine
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> x86 is a real mess
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i believe that 😄
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> variable length instructions is a bad start
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 40 years of backwards compatibility is a design error
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but i defs want to see another cisc
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> also x86_64 is not 40 years old 😄
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> x86 is
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes but the fuck uses 32bit
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> code compiled today (which most use the same x86 prefix) still runs on the good old 8086
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> code compiled today (which most use the same x86 prefix instructions) still runs on the good old 8086
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean the industry that uses such programs also doesnt need more performance anyway, isnt that kinda true?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i often think the industry argument isnt really the greatest
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, now they indeed have 64 bits registers which would not work back then
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just drop x86 and emulate it, and in 3 years bcs hardware gets faster nobody cares xd
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but the decode unit of intel's cpu is a bloat
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean i often heard the decoding is expensive
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i mixed myself, 40 years old code still run on today's hardware
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's a mistake
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and the power consumption doesnt speak for amd or intel
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but the effective speed is still good XD
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would a modern cisc just use 32bit word length?
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and not decode?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> power consumption is important for servers
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or 16bit
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and for the planet as well
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 32 is maybe overkill xD
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dont fly or ride a car would be more
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wdym "32bit word length and not decode"?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and video calls are an easy way to illuminate most of that 😄
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean x86 without a decoder basiucally
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would require fixed since OP code sizes
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you always need a decode stage
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so e.g. 16 bit for the OPcode and i dunno how much more for whatever it needs on informations
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so e.g. 16 bit for the OPcode and i dunno how much more for whatever it needs on information
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> risc-v has 4 bytes instructions
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> there's a compressed extension with 2 bytes instructions
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> you need 3x5 bits for 3 registers opcodes
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mh ok
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> plus, you don't use 16 bits opcode, but like 8 is well enough
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for risc?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but for cisc?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> then you add some bits that depends on each opcodes for variation
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> to ease the decode and minimize hardware
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't know for cisc
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> in all cases, you don't need much opcodes bits
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but we need cisc, bcs i need more performance
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> pls study cisc
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> the more bits, the more hardware (more muxes in decode stage)
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> gib time & money pls
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> mostly time 😄
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah ok, time is an issue accepted
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> if you're interested, i can send you my manuscript once i have finished it
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> chapter one will discuss global context in semiconductor industry
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> power wall, energy wall, dark silicon
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> memory problems
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if there are nice graphs i take it
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> the picture i sent you are there. I just need to redo them in latex to fit the other figures style

16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> enjoy chapter 1
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but there are lots of interesting thing there
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 1300 pages though ^^
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nice
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> even relativly up to date
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> will look a bit into it later, but now football xd
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> tv or outside 😄 ?
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> outside 😄
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> better
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should I use `LOCK` or `std::mutex` in new code?
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> std::mutex xd
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> unique_lock
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or lock_guard
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or scoped_lock for the c++17 gangsters
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but scoped_lock apparently allows to use multiple mutex but also no mutex
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that kinda sucks
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> only skipped through it, but reads pretty nice, kinda mix of an article and some more specific information 😄
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's sad that `curl_multi_poll` doesn't have a block forever version
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> My alternative is to use select with `curl_multi_fdset` but then I have to deal with file descriptors larger than `FD_SETSIZE` myself, or I could use the newer event based API but then I need to wrap `epoll` in system.cpp. Annoying
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it maybe time for us to move to libevent to handle this stuff for us?
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> wow curls manual really sucks
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it doesnt even mention valid usages for the timeout parameter
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, pretty annoying, I had to look at the source to make sure
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I could pass `INT_MAX` as timeout
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/972917324023742474/RDT_20220508_1945491390148576957613074.jpg

20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Paralix> Why on GER2 my dummy ping 50, and main 69?
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> anyone using dwm there ?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> does anyone know how to build acl?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> does anyone know how to build acl for networking?
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> suckless software usually sucks
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> software is not that easy and unless u rly want simple stuff its meh
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also if u didnt know, some suckless authors email use a reference to german nazis xd
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > official suckless.org mails originating from a host using a nazi reference (wolfsschanze, hitler’s summer residence) as hostname.
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u are on x11 i recommend i3-gaps on wayland sway
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mfw getting framed as nazis just because they don't subscribe to the systemd cult
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no, its because using direct references to nazi stuff lol

20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nothing i guess
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> are u against simple software now bcs some weirdos are for it?
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont get it
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no i just pointed it out
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i actually used dwm before i3
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it didnt like it
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> i already used i3
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> use kwin and ur games just run ™️
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u dont like i3?
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u know haskell there is xmoand
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xmonad
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> y ik xmonad
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (also buggy af)
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just saiyan
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> i3 was cool but i just wanted to test dwm
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> dwm is cool and very customizable
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just use terminal lets face it
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> x)
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> true
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> tty only
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> why need wm
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> text is suckless
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> firefox sucks
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use suckless browser
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux is bloated
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> remove drivers
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tru
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> package manager is bloat too
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> host your own server
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dont use google its bloated af
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> own kernel
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> use library
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the http protocol is bloated
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont use the web
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> public libraries
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> tcp only
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> udp
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no tcp
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> reliability is bloat
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i miss the old times
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> windows xp starts in less than 1 second on my vm xd
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the good old days
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> 😄
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks in the old times u didnt have a ssd
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its fake
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes but software wasnt bloated xd
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u remember the browsers
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> witht 5 layers of extensions
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on the search bar
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i miss firefox 3.6
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that was stable for like 5years no real updates
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> now its firefox 101
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and it sucks xd
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why it sucks
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the only bad thing is webgl perf
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> what does not suck on modern browsers
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok i actually like css
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i need this for our client
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> modern css is way better
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> than old css
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> old css was spamming tables
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to get stuff to work
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> flexbox is godsent
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> email templates still use tables btw
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a nightmare
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well i want to be honest with u
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> firefox for devs, best browser(bcs the tools and the f12 menu and stuff)
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but firefox is so much behind webkit
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> webgl performance, stuff like backdrop filter still not default
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no scrollbar customizations
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> svg is buggy
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadge
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine not being backed by a multi billion dollar company
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and being not for profit
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> web browser development is insanely costly
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah but its still kinda mozillas fault
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> way more than kernel development
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> before chrome was there all used firefox
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its insane
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but they slept and slept
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and chrome modernized the web
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or google
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and then firefox just ran behind
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> netscape best
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mostly use firefox on mobile tho
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs adblock xD
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and videos in background
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh ye
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have ublock on firefox android
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i use fenec tho
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs its in fdroid
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> web dev is rly mobile focused because adblocks there are even rarer
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yes trui
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> even on desktop
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think only 30% ppl use adblock
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl are dumb af
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its probs more ignorance
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if they knew they could hide them they probs would do it
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> tbh i am suprised so many ppl arent annoyed enough to activly search for using adblocks
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean when u buy a samsung TV nowadays u get fucking ads on them
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> like wtf
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i use a dns based adblock inside our router nowadays
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs its too annoying to deal with all platforms individually
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I use bspwm now, it's pretty good
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have to switch to https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz its made in rust
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES3_ChadShirtRip:756135949494386749>
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > LeftWM was built from the very beginning to support multiple screens and ultrawide monitors. The default keybindings support ultrawide monitors and multiple screens.
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice feature
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leftwm/leftwm/main/screenshots/4.jpg
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lol
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nobos
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> where is glassy blur

21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> use that css xd
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but not on firefox xddd
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i want this for ddnet too

21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> looks sheesh
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> nobo

21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> Sad
21:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> Where are emojis on status bar?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hi can anyone guide me where to start if i want to generate ddnet maps with python/scripting?
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> eh
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if ur new to programming its gonna be a ride
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but for starters you need to use patigas library
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> twmap
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's why I started using xmonad, it's written and configures in haskell 😄
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think someone had some maze examples, would be nice if they could share them, probably easiest to start from a working generator
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in rust there is a popular config format that blends really well with rust types
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its this one
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ron-rs/ron
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rust object notation
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > RON is a simple readable data serialization format that looks similar to Rust syntax. It's designed to support all of Serde's data model, so structs, enums, tuples, arrays, generic maps, and primitive values.

23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> anyone has installed spotify without fking snap ?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> this `https://aur.archlinux.org/spotify.git` is so unstable
