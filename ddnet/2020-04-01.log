10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen just wanted to let you know, your blog https://hookrace.net/ is down for some reason
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well not down as is, its just blank
10:30 <@deen> thanks, I accidentally overrode the index.html yesterday
10:30 <@deen> overwrote*
10:46 <@Learath2> heinrich5991: is there a reason you didn't use the aio facilities of the host systems?
10:58 <@Learath2> ah, windows' console can't do overlapped io because it's a fake file
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> does anyone know what
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```int m_ColorEnv;
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> int m_ColorEnvOffset;
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> are for (in  `CMapItemLayerTilemap` (`game/mapitems.h`))
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> envelope for color, time offset
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> envelopes (I don't know the reason for the name) are basically teeworlds's animations; this is how you can make color-animated layers
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah okay
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so i guess they are only relevant in 'tiles' layers
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> would you consider all those `version` variables worth checking while parsing a map?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, also for quads
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I do it (always with `>=`)
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ooh `m_aName` is for the layer name i guess?
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 After your commit https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2453/commits/165ab18cd230a1450832bef11835234d1627094f the chat command `/map Kobra` would trigger `[chat-command]: calling 'm' with args 'Kobra'`, interpreting it as a `/mute` command. Will you fix or should I open an issue in the teeworlds repo?

15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uhhh, what
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I tested only with `/map` not being registered as a chat command through. It should still be sent as a chat message to the server though I guess
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I tested only with `/map` not being registered as a chat command though. It should still be sent as a chat message to the server though I guess
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh is that a failure of strcmp with different size strings?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually no strcmp should be handling that ifne
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fine*
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't see how map resolves to m
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i didnt look at the commit, just did git bisect to find it :D
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro do you get that dbg msg on the server or the client?
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> client, the server gets no `CL_SAY` msg at all
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> i guess it would mute a client called Kobra clientside if it were on the server
15:32 <@Learath2> Ah, it's the last command that slightly matches
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @timakro you can send remove chat command packets, to remove the clientside commands from the 0.7 client
15:44 <@Learath2> @timakro #2532
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> thanks @Learath2
16:54 <@Learath2> @timakro np, let's hope oy decides to start merging again :)
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 31 open prs
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 11 of them mine
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 really pumps out code every day ^^
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> does anyone have experience with the 0.7 `sv_map_download_speed` setting? Is the default of 2 a good value?
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I guess it's kinda similar to ddnets `sv_map_window` if not more conservative
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "Number of map data packages a client gets on each request'
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> each data packet is about a KB large
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so, say you have a particular good ping of 10ms to the server
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then we get 100 * 1000 * 16 B/s
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so 1.6MB/s (or 12.8 Mb/s)
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for the best ping that I can imagine. setting it to the max value (16) seems reasonable
17:44 <@Learath2> I have a roadmap to http map downloads on vanilla, first part is getting an extended serverinfo protocol in
17:44 <@Learath2> then we convince oy to upgrade us to c++14, then getting the new engine jobs into vanilla
17:44 <@Learath2> after that it's trivial to add in the http map downloads
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ha, goold luck
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> thanks @heinrich5991
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Does anybody know how connless tokens work in 0.7? From sniffing packets it seems to me like the client determines two tokens and the server responds with both. Do i miss something or where is the security for the server here? For example from serverstatus request flood
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's a TOKEN message first, do you see that? @timakro
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 so the server sends a token message before sending the serverinfo?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, the server doesn't respond to REQUESTINFO packets unless they carry the correct token
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the correct token can be obtained from the server using the TOKEN ctrl message
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> maybe this isn't required for LAN?
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thank you ddnet discord admin
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :)
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's perfect
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> whoj changed it
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> huh?
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> u just copied kog :kek:
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i made it
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> what xD
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's perfect
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> sure
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @jao you should also make that transparent outline for the 1
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's @Ryozuki
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> im not an artist
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> gg you actually got me xD
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ...
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> XDDD
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> lmao
