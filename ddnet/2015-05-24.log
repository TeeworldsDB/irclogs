00:00 < eeeee> but what about existing records and vanilla
00:01 < eeeee> (assuming using their steam accounts is even possible from open source)
00:06 <@EastByte> teeworlds/ddnet is not suited for that
00:08 <@EastByte> the only thing (to acc) I can imagine is a possibility to verify friends ingame
00:08 <@EastByte> for ranks an stuff we would need another independent ranking table
00:10 < eeeee> yeah that was basically my suggestion, keep the existing ranks as is and use accounts for new features like "achievement unlocked: The More the Merrier (finish a map in a team of at least 7 tees)
00:11 < eeeee> "
00:14 <@EastByte> still impossibruu
00:14 < eeeee> huh, why
00:15 <@EastByte> sure it is possible but it is worth an implementation in ddnet?

00:15 < eeeee> doesn't sound that hard to implement
00:15 <@EastByte> dat release time...
00:16 <@EastByte> laxa: one finish one with me?
00:16 <@EastByte> and tell me which one
00:16 < laxa> hum ?
00:16 < laxa> ah new maps ?
00:17 < laxa> I haven't been playing tw for ages ^^
00:17 < laxa> currently playing dota 2 !
00:17 <@EastByte> but you know ddmax maps
00:17 < laxa> yes
00:17 < laxa> but those names don't ring a bell in my head
00:17 <@EastByte> ring ring
00:17 <@EastByte> I know cloudy
00:17 < laxa> ^^
00:20 < Learath2> Well the only solution i think would be to leave the old records as is and start anew 
00:20 < Learath2> that'd mean reseting points 
00:20 < Learath2> that would mean public outrage
00:20 <@EastByte> indeed
00:20 < Learath2> should vote it
00:20 <@EastByte> I would rather wait for a completely new game
00:21 < Learath2> Reset all points and get a shiny unspoofable account system or stay as is and get no account system
00:25 < eeeee> then no account system it is for now
00:26 < Learath2> ill sketch some things up as to how it'd work with or without rank reset
03:42 < XxDarioxX> .
09:21 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: ever heard of backward-compatiblity?
09:21 <@heinrich5991> removing all points is basically a no-go :)

10:55 <@heinrich5991> so many new maps?
11:01 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: these are old ddmax maps
11:01 <@EastByte> 5 released per day
11:02 <@heinrich5991> ah
11:02 <@EastByte> you probably played some of those back then :P
11:02 <@heinrich5991> :)
13:31 < Learath2> heinrich5991: backward compatibility is impossible as discussed before
13:31 < Learath2> Unless deen was taking government issued ID's from people who has ranks
13:40 <@EastByte> actually we once had a different solution for that
13:40 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: what about letting people take previous records into the new account system
13:40 <@heinrich5991> plus some fine tuning
13:40 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: can you please not answer in the same moment as I do? ^^
13:40 <@EastByte> haha
13:40 <@heinrich5991> :)
13:41 < NooBxGockeL> teeworlds goes steam ? wtf, pls no ._. i like teeworlds beeing small and independent. I approve for account system tho, no fakers anymore, but it'd make DDRace client substantially different from standard. Might scare some people off.
13:42 <@EastByte> every ddnet client user has 2 unique timeout codes (player+dummy)
13:42 <@EastByte> we can already identifier players using it
13:42 < NooBxGockeL> no, not players, but machines
13:42 <@EastByte> so people could prove it's their nickname and we can bind it to his account
13:44 <@EastByte> NooBxGockeL: the discussions here mostly aren't realistic anyway^^
13:44 < NooBxGockeL> lol ^^ why discussing then. The idea isnt that bad
13:45 <@EastByte> this is how developers talk
13:45 < NooBxGockeL> i'd know that, im one myself :P
13:46 < NooBxGockeL> but sadly tw is written in c++, im java ._.
13:46 < Learath2> heinrich5991: inb4 someone joins the server does /register alldemnicks
13:46 < Learath2> EastByte: the two unique timeout codes can they be reset ?
13:46 <@EastByte> ^ and there we still have timeout codes to prove
13:46 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: no problem, old records can be used more than once
13:46 < Learath2> or do they change on nicks
13:46 <@EastByte> Learath2: they can
13:47 <@EastByte> but I guess most people are having the same code since the beginning
13:47 < Learath2> inb4 everyone does /mergerecords bestplayer eu
13:47 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: plus some manual fine tuning
13:47 <@heinrich5991> of course, you can construct bad scenarios
13:47 <@heinrich5991> but that's not the point
13:47 <@heinrich5991> not merging the records at all is way worse
13:48 < Learath2> i quite like EastByte's idea actually
13:48 < NooBxGockeL> heinrich5991, i dont think so, the scenario of /merge milk nxg is way worse than if all have to start at 0
13:48 < Learath2> we should collect a database of timeout codes and associate them with nicks then records
13:48 <@EastByte> Learath2: deen already did that (atleast he wanted to)
13:48 < Learath2> afterwards people can just /mergerecords timeoutcode
13:49 <@heinrich5991> NooBxGockeL: "manual fine tuning"
13:49 < Learath2> and that should minimize manual fine tuning
13:49 <@EastByte> and we have to be careful since these codes can be stolen
13:49 <@heinrich5991> (also, I hope no one plans on making nickname registration)
13:50 < Learath2> not sure if we should let people register nicks
13:50 < Learath2> probably shouldnt
13:50 <@heinrich5991> (no newer game has this anymore, everywhere the nickname can be given more than once. consider steam, battle.net, etc.)
13:51 < Learath2> maybe a way of making sure someone is who he claims to be
13:51 < NooBxGockeL> ^ that is nickname registration
13:52 <@heinrich5991> no
13:52 <@heinrich5991> does steam have nickname registration?
13:52 <@heinrich5991> can you be sure of some people's identities?
13:52 < Learath2> yes check their steamid 
13:52 <@heinrich5991> (answers are: no, yes, in that order)
13:53 < Learath2> so if we have a table of records <-> timeout code <-> nicks it should be trivial to merge the records
13:53 < NooBxGockeL> that is true, yes, maybe im biased, i personally dont like that system... all the unicode xXxHaX0R3DxXx guys are annoying
13:54 <@heinrich5991> NooBxGockeL: what would you do if your nickname was registered before you had a chance to
13:54 <@heinrich5991> ?
13:54 <@heinrich5991> get over it and make a new nickname? :)
13:54 < NooBxGockeL> nah, but that can be handled with timeoutcodes ?
13:55 < NooBxGockeL> aka record timeoutcode, extract both, input in online form, register email to nickname
13:55 <@heinrich5991> if two players have the same nick, who gets it?
13:55 < NooBxGockeL> yeah thats worst case
13:55 <@EastByte> I always get 'east'
13:55 <@EastByte> even on github
13:56 <@heinrich5991> minus doesn't always get minus
13:56 <@EastByte> pff
13:56 <@heinrich5991> not even on github
13:56 < Learath2> someone had my nick on steam i asked support to give it to me and they did for some reason :D
13:56 <@EastByte> Learath2 was in use?
13:56 < Learath2> yep
13:56 < Learath2> as a username not a nickname tho
13:56 <@heinrich5991> there is no such thing as "in use". you mean the URL?
13:56 <@heinrich5991> oh, you mean username
13:56 < Learath2> the actual login name you use
13:57 <@EastByte> they gave you the account?
13:57 < Learath2> yep they just associated it with my email
13:57 < Learath2> it was prolly inactive or smth
13:57 <@EastByte> lol
14:03 <@EastByte> I guess the first thing we should do is analysing how well the timeout codes are suitable for that
14:03 <@EastByte> building up a database with nicks and codes
14:04 <@EastByte> maybe asking some players
14:05 <@EastByte> or we could add another unique id to the clients (using a client update)
14:06 <@EastByte> doing a relation between timeoutcode and unique id
14:06 < savander> protectioncodes are better
14:06 < savander> you know why? Because a week ago was bug in updater
14:06 <@EastByte> what's a protectioncode?
14:07 < savander> oh, this code which is used at start 
14:07 < savander> timeout code
14:07 <@EastByte> yea but it can be abused
14:07 <@EastByte> since every server can log them
14:08 <@EastByte> the thing with the client updater is another problem
14:08 < Learath2> do we have any statistics on how many people are stuck on 7.6
14:09 <@EastByte> not sure, but it's not hard to make one
14:09 < Learath2> does the client report the version when connecting ?
14:09 <@EastByte> yes
14:09 <@EastByte> iirc
14:09 < savander> client sends information about version?
14:09 < savander> ah.
14:09 < savander> nvm :p.
14:10 < Learath2> is deen the only person with access to things ? 
14:10 <@EastByte> yep, he is the only administrator
14:18 <@EastByte> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/game/version.h#L9
14:18 <@EastByte> this number is sent on join
14:20 < savander> so...
14:21 < Learath2> well deen didnt change it for 7.6.1
14:21 < Learath2> it should be easy to get the next update out with a different number
14:21 <@EastByte> 7.6.1 doesnt fit into this version number I guess
14:22 <@EastByte> so the next version needs to be 7.7
22:19 <@deen> back
22:19 <@deen> i hope i didn't miss too much
