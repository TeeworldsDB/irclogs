01:07 < bridge> <patiga> Godot :D
01:08 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ooo
01:08 < bridge> <patiga> and tilemaps were a bit painful
01:10 < bridge> <teero777> looks dunny
01:10 < bridge> <teero777> looks funny
01:50 < bridge> <Ewan> miniaudio
01:59 < bridge> <Ewan> good morning
03:13 < bridge> <_gwendal> am i doing smth wrong ? :justatest:
03:13 < bridge> <_gwendal> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1165820293596594228/debian_xC4PNuIk4I.png?ex=65483dc1&is=6535c8c1&hm=674b02e2bb42feb8ed23283505b31d00ac4f857b8308fdf4f468649aad805fe8&
03:15 < bridge> <Ewan> where'd u get this
03:15 < bridge> <_gwendal> https://ddnet.org/downloads/
03:15 < bridge> <Ewan> your distro needs multiarch support to run a 32 bit binary if the system is 64 bit
03:16 < bridge> <_gwendal> tried both linux download just in case but both make the same errors
03:16 < bridge> <Ewan> get the x86_64
03:16 < bridge> <_gwendal> uh
03:16 < bridge> <Ewan> wtf
03:16 < bridge> <_gwendal> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1165821016027697232/Discord_XJ6gIlgOky.png?ex=65483e6e&is=6535c96e&hm=227d99a92720e6d89091fa1b2d65701411b7e4a519f8db432e9314ad735c2038&
03:16 < bridge> <Ewan> so it also does this on 64 bit?
03:16 < bridge> <Ewan> well what is ur host
03:16 < bridge> <_gwendal> i'm using weird oracle cloud linux machins
03:16 < bridge> <_gwendal> i'm using weird oracle cloud linux machines
03:16 < bridge> <_gwendal> might be related
03:16 < bridge> <Ewan> it could be arm
03:16 < bridge> <Ewan> uname -a
03:17 < bridge> <_gwendal> ```Linux je-ten-supplie 5.15.0-1040-oracle #46-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 14 21:47:21 UTC 2023 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux```
03:17 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah it's arm
03:17 < bridge> <Ewan> you'd have to build from source. given ddnet even supports arm yet, which idk about
03:17 < bridge> <_gwendal> aight sounds like a fun challenge
03:17 < bridge> <Ewan> didn't see ubuntu :justatest:
03:17 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
03:17 < bridge> <Ewan> good luck
03:21 < bridge> <_gwendal> it's kinda weird cause the server was working when i got it from apt :tear:
03:22 < bridge> <Ewan> actually i remember now that ddnet uses a universal binary on mac so it should support arm
03:22 < bridge> <_gwendal> o i'll try it xd
03:22 < bridge> <Ewan> aarch64 build may be packaged for apt arm repos
03:22 < bridge> <Ewan> just not on ddnet website
03:22 < bridge> <Ewan> but u want to not use apt cuz it's older right
03:22 < bridge> <_gwendal> i'm stupid for not seeing it wtf
03:23 < bridge> <_gwendal> dmg file :justatest:
03:24 < bridge> <Ewan> why downloading mac build :justatest:
03:24 < bridge> <_gwendal> because it's written arm ?! :justatest: i am so clueless idk what i am doing
03:25 < bridge> <yekrm> The only option is to emulate an x86-64 environment
03:25 < bridge> <Ewan> no it's not LOL
03:26 < bridge> <Ewan> git clone https://github.com/DDNet/DDNet
03:26 < bridge> <Ewan> git checkout 17.3
03:26 < bridge> <Ewan> cmake -B build -S .

03:26 < bridge> <Ewan> ./build/DDNet-Server
03:26 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
03:26 < bridge> <Ewan> that is how u build from source
03:26 < bridge> <Ewan> required build tools are cmake and rust, and u will also need all compile time dependencies
03:27 < bridge> <Ewan> oh yeah check it out <https://github.com/DDNet/DDNet#dependencies-on-linux--macos>
03:27 < bridge> <_gwendal> yea i was trying to figure out which arguments i should put on cmake following this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet#building-on-linux-and-macos
03:27 < bridge> <Ewan> `sudo apt install build-essential cargo cmake git glslang-tools google-mock libavcodec-extra libavdevice-dev libavfilter-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libfreetype6-dev libglew-dev libnotify-dev libogg-dev libopus-dev libopusfile-dev libpng-dev libsdl2-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libvulkan-dev libwavpack-dev libx264-dev python rustc spirv-tools`
03:27 < bridge> <_gwendal> yea saw it
03:27 < bridge> <_gwendal> thanks :))
03:27 < bridge> <Ewan> np
03:28 < bridge> <Ewan> if you wanted to add compile opts u would do like this
03:28 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
03:28 < bridge> <Ewan> git clone https://github.com/DDNet/DDNet
03:28 < bridge> <Ewan> git checkout 17.3

03:29 < bridge> <furo321> btw, because you're on ARM. You also need to pass these two options to cmake `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsigned-char" -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fsigned-char"`, if I remember correctly :)
03:29 < bridge> <Ewan> nice ^^
03:34 < bridge> <_gwendal> i'm not sure i understand everything that is happening but it looks really cool
03:35 < bridge> <_gwendal> what is DOPT1 and DOPT2 btw ?
03:35 < bridge> <yekrm> :owo:
03:35 < bridge> <_gwendal> thanks, i put em :owo:
03:36 < bridge> <Ewan> example
03:36 < bridge> <_gwendal> XDD im stupid omg
03:37 < bridge> <Ewan> like all these
03:37 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1165826185171841075/image.png?ex=6548433e&is=6535ce3e&hm=81c0f0cea6ebafd2596618bbef9bcc7698820f8bda36fa535e10c81c8eb57d8c&

03:37 < bridge> <_gwendal> yeye xd
03:37 < bridge> <_gwendal> i was trying to find these options in that list u just sent and was like "wtf this guy gave me" xddd
03:37 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
03:37 < bridge> <Ewan> if ur only running a server u can turn off a lot of stuff
03:38 < bridge> <Ewan> will make build faster and maybe a smaller executable
03:38 < bridge> <Ewan> but it doesn't rly matter
03:38 < bridge> <_gwendal> yea i thought about it, but realized i would take more time to understand what i can disable or not
03:39 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
03:39 < bridge> <Ewan> default is fine
03:40 < bridge> <_gwendal> it worked :owo:
03:40 < bridge> <Ewan> congratulations
03:40 < bridge> <_gwendal> thanks, it's all you and @furo321
03:42 < bridge> <_gwendal> indeed the server looks different from the 15.9 i was using 2 days ago xd

03:45 < bridge> <_gwendal> This is weird cause the server actually is registered ?
03:46 < bridge> <furo321> It failed to register on IPv6, you can disable it with `sv_register ipv4` if you want.
03:49 < bridge> <_gwendal> Thanks worked :owo:
07:01 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> @jupeyy_keks thanks for the review :owo:

09:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
09:18 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> morning üçµ
09:38 < bridge> <Ewan> morning
09:38 < bridge> <Ewan> my mom used the last of my good coffee
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> well
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> she left some but it wasn‚Äôt even enough for a double shot
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> and we‚Äôre out of milk
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> oh my god.
09:43 < bridge> <cyberFighter> hi
09:43 < bridge> <cyberFighter> rest in peace
10:19 < bridge> <learath2> Have any of you heard of the "Visitor Pattern"?
10:20 < bridge> <learath2> I never knew it had a name üòÑ
10:35 < bridge> <j.0u> Hello i have tried repeatedly to add this ‚ÄúAuto Verify‚Äù feature to my client but to no avail It doesn't show any errors but it doesn't work :feelsbadman: 
10:35 < bridge> <j.0u> 
10:35 < bridge> <j.0u> ```
10:35 < bridge> <j.0u> https://github.com/sjrc6/TaterClient-ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/verify.cpp
10:35 < bridge> <j.0u> ```
10:37 < bridge> <j.0u> I created the gconfig and added that to cmakelists.txt as well:
10:37 < bridge> <j.0u>     components/verify.cpp
10:37 < bridge> <j.0u>     components/verify.h
10:38 < bridge> <j.0u> 
10:38 < bridge> <j.0u> The rest of the steps are in gameclient.h
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> well plz tell us the erro
11:09 < bridge> <Ewan> well plz tell us the error
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> oh nvm
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> u said no errors
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> plz debug and make sure that the auto verify code is actually being run
11:10 < bridge> <Ewan> if it's a component i have a hunch that you added the object definition in gameclient.h but never actually added it to the client's list of components as is also required in gameclient.cpp
11:11 < bridge> <Ewan> u will see a long long list of `m_SomeComponent`
11:12 < bridge> <Ewan> that's my caveman explanation i'd have to look at the code to be any more specific
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> serde is built upon that
11:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/de/trait.Visitor.html
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe ill invent a random data format and implement the serde traits
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> can be a good way to learn the ins and outs of serde
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> can be a good way to learn the ins  of serde
11:14 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft so u want to be a mod
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> to mute my rust speech
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
11:21 < bridge> <Ewan> that's exactly wy
11:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i knew it
11:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i hate rust with a blazing passion
11:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i will mute all your rust speech so fast
11:30 < bridge> <j.0u> bro u saved my life
11:30 < bridge> <j.0u> :owo: :owo: :owo: :owo:  thxx ‚ô•
11:30 < bridge> <Ewan> üòÉ
11:37 < bridge> <ladno_t.> please give me the textures of the copy love box
11:39 < bridge> <Ewan> map extract is very easy to use
11:39 < bridge> <Ewan> drag and drop
11:39 < bridge> <ladno_t.> I don't understand how to use it at all
11:41 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1165948043800084521/Discord_pEcdBywu5f.mp4?ex=6548b4bb&is=65363fbb&hm=7d26c60fcdc3a9f0fdd5f0fccc6a3fc13c0ed0958a0a4113eb179e0c7cf50c30&
11:42 < bridge> <ladno_t.> and how to download the map
11:45 < bridge> <Ewan> well i would say get it from heinrich's archive but i'm not finding it
11:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i just happened to have it in my downloaded maps
11:45 < bridge> <Ewan> which is at `C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\DDNet\downloadedmaps` on Windows
11:46 < bridge> <ladno_t.> Okay, thanks, you're the only one who explained it clearly.
11:46 < bridge> <sedonya> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Extra_tools
12:01 < bridge> <sedonya> How can I output the UUID of the system in the client?
12:02 < bridge> <Ewan> don't remember the exact fn
12:05 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym the system
12:05 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
12:05 < bridge> <Ewan> CUuid &id; // idk where u want to get this from
12:05 < bridge> <Ewan> 
12:05 < bridge> <Ewan> char aBuf[UUID_MAXSTRSIZE];
12:05 < bridge> <Ewan> FormatUuid(id, aBuf, sizeof(aBuf));
12:05 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
12:07 < bridge> <learath2> Uuid of the system?
12:07 < bridge> <learath2> That makes less than 0 sense
12:09 < bridge> <sedonya> I want to make access to my client by UUID to block those who violate the usage rules
12:09 < bridge> <sedonya> Just UUID, I misspoke a little bit.
12:09 < bridge> <sedonya> Just UUID, I misspoke a little bit
12:10 < bridge> <Ewan> make and store a UUID in the settings. this will be purged on a settings change tho, so it will not work for persistent stuff like bans
12:10 < bridge> <learath2> People will just change the uuid
12:10 < bridge> <Ewan> u can *try* and formulate some sort of unique identifier based on system info but it would not be worth it
12:10 < bridge> <sedonya> How can I do adequate blocking then? For example, so that only reinstalling the OS will help
12:11 < bridge> <Ewan> it will not be simple
12:12 < bridge> <Ewan> this is a problem ddnet has already and wants to solve
12:12 < bridge> <Ewan> the most popular idea for a solution is an accounts system... and look where we are
12:13 < bridge> <Ewan> the best/simplest you can do is probably implement some sort of simple auth using some web service + oauth or something, so people will have to use burner emails if they want to cheat
12:13 < bridge> <Ewan> and emails are getting harder to make. especially in batches
12:13 < bridge> <Ewan> so that would probably suffice for small-time rule-breakers
12:14 < bridge> <sedonya> Thank you very much, I'll try to think of something
12:15 < bridge> <Ewan> also this will need to be supported server-side if you want it to be immune to client mod bypasses
12:16 < bridge> <Ewan> so it will not work on ddnet or kog or whatever servers unless they choose to implement your auth method. which is pretty far fetched
12:16 < bridge> <Ewan> it's a hard problem to solve
12:16 < bridge> <sedonya> What is the DDnet team doing at the moment? An account system? New official server tags?
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> but if you can auth with some server you host only for the sake of authenticating the client + the client is responsible for blocking abusers from joining servers, it would still work well enough to deter small time offenders
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> but if you can auth with some server you host only for the sake of authenticating the client + the client is responsible for blocking abusers from joining servers based on the response from said server, it would still work well enough to deter small time offenders
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> but once someone patches this out it's over. they will just share the exe
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> nothing really üòÉ
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> a lot of talk
12:17 < bridge> <sedonya> :brownbear:
12:17 < bridge> <Ewan> everyone wants to do it their own way and nobody with the knowledge has made an implementation that people are onboard with
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> i'd do it but i know next to nothing about cryptography/security so there would probably be huge holes in the logic
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> also i have a hard time even finishing client mods
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> so
12:18 < bridge> <sedonya> I'd love to do what I can, but my knowledge is still a bit lacking
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> yea man just keep doing ur thing
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> code and learn
12:18 < bridge> <Ewan> then u will be a genius.
12:19 < bridge> <Ewan> speaking of which i would quite like to have async skins and assets, but this baggage i've introduced in my pr is really not cool
12:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i thought it was justified but it's basically as much work to just roll a new implementation with a custom job for each instance... like...
12:19 < bridge> <Ewan> iif it had worked out like how i'd initially envisioned it, maybe not. but there are so many more parameters for init/precautions you have to take when using this mass file loader thing that i don't even think it's worth it
12:20 < bridge> <sedonya> I have so many cool ideas for a client, and I've gotten even more from my client's small community <3
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i love to hear that
12:20 < bridge> <Ewan> as long as what you're doing is kosher i think it's awesome
12:21 < bridge> <sedonya> Most importantly I would like to make support for custom skins on weapons, partials, etc. Same as skins, only more so
12:22 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i think voxel had a similar idea
12:22 < bridge> <Ewan> would be cool
12:22 < bridge> <Ewan> but you'd want the infrastructure for it
12:22 < bridge> <sedonya> I'd also like to make support for sound sets, instead of people just replacing the standard files
12:22 < bridge> <sedonya> I'd also like to make support for sound sets, instead of people just replacing the default files
12:23 < bridge> <Ewan> that would be cool. but personally i'd rather those features just be in ddnet itself you know xd
12:25 < bridge> <sedonya> Everyone wants to do their own thing, but usually the DDnet team will just add your nickname to the news list
12:25 < bridge> <sedonya> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1165959260602105906/image.png?ex=6548bf2e&is=65364a2e&hm=ab5e2354eb900e70fe5379ad6bc59e615b550967f14f7bb0ae9cc7052f5d8fcb&
12:26 < bridge> <Ewan> yea but at least u get to be purple xd :feelsbadman:
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> sedonya the problem is that now every new feature that ddnet comes out with, your users are gonna also want. that makes a lot of work for you
12:28 < bridge> <Ewan> unless you structure your code very intelligently most big updates are goiing to be a lot of dealing with merge conflicts
12:29 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't even have an official client and i already have this problem. a few ppl use my hacked together status bar thing + i have to backport ddnet features and make windows builds every so often
12:29 < bridge> <sedonya> The info says to get ``dev`` you have to send a PR. But nowhere does it say that it must be useful. They didn't accept what I did to my mod - color, that counts too :feelsbadman:
12:30 < bridge> <sedonya> My server is the most popular of the unofficial ones
12:31 < bridge> <Ewan> is yours the fng server?
12:31 < bridge> <sedonya> My main server is S-DDR, but I also have a godfng server as well
12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> i see
12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> s-ddr doesn't show up in my browser
12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> is it block?
12:32 < bridge> <sedonya> yes
12:32 < bridge> <Ewan> cool
12:33 < bridge> <sedonya> And since a good antichit is only given to official servers, we have them allowed. Thanks to what we have collected almost all DDnet bots, which makes the official servers cleaner :owo:
12:34 < bridge> <sedonya> I'm strongly against cheats, but it's easier to allow them than to run through every application and only ban half of the noticeable cheaters
12:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft have u still not contributed to ddnet?
12:34 < bridge> <Ewan> nope
12:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:34 < bridge> <Ewan> ddnetters dont like the way i code
12:34 < bridge> <Ewan> or think
12:34 < bridge> <Ewan> my features are stupid
12:34 < bridge> <Ewan> i could always pick up some mundane issue if i wanted to become purple i guess
12:35 < bridge> <Ewan> ya fuck it let's become purple
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> well it wont be useful if ubecome blue
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> but pruple is cooler
12:35 < bridge> <Ewan> üòÉ
12:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i might become blue
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> its already set
12:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm afraid there aren't enough USA players on here to vouch for me tho
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> its ok u will get it
12:36 < bridge> <sedonya> Why do all roles have color and wiki contr are the only ones like suckers
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i hope so
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> most of usa is in tee cafe
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> or cool ddracers discord
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> wiki gives the icon
12:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> what is that
12:36 < bridge> <Ewan> a server
12:36 < bridge> <sedonya> That explains everything
12:37 < bridge> <sedonya> infclass?
12:37 < bridge> <Ewan> no sry tee cafe is a discord server
12:37 < bridge> <sedonya> a
12:37 < bridge> <sedonya> okay
12:37 < bridge> <Ewan> that i was in at one point, but left and now can't find an invite to üòπ
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> send link
12:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna check
12:37 < bridge> <Ewan> that i was in at one point, but left and now can't find an invite to üòÇ
12:37 < bridge> <Ewan> @syrinok hey u got tee cafe invite?
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> this is the only american mongrel online rn i bet
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got it
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> WTF
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> #welcome
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> sry for ping skeith
12:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it even active
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> i am not sure
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> usually i just have a hunch that ppl are there
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> a certain set of ppl playing in team but not using text chat
12:38 < bridge> <Ewan> so i assume they're in voice. and if they're not in cool ddracers, i assume they're in tee cafe
12:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok i alreayd left got bored
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> W
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> consider it is 4:39 for me rn
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> nobody's gonna be up except for weirdos like me
12:39 < bridge> <Ewan> and skeith
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm trying to flip flop my sleep schedule rn. my espresso machine got me into this mess, it can get me out
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> when i first got it i drank 1 drink from it and the damage was already done. went to bed at 4 am and it's been this way for about a week
12:40 < bridge> <Ewan> my caffeine sensitivity really went up when i stopped drinking it so regularly
12:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i also promised my mom i'd go to the store and get some stuff but i lost track of time and the store closed. so now i'm just gonna go as soon as it opens
12:44 < bridge> <sedonya> Buy coffee?
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> the coffee i get you can only buy online
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> at least in my area
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i usually get the sugar shack blend. it's delicious <https://vividcoffee.com/shop>
12:45 < bridge> <Ewan> also cheaper
12:46 < bridge> <sedonya> ??

12:46 < bridge> <Ewan> yes
12:46 < bridge> <Ewan> that
12:46 < bridge> <Ewan> i am bored so i will stream
12:47 < bridge> <sedonya> Pretty cheap, I guess
12:47 < bridge> <Ewan> not really
12:47 < bridge> <Ewan> it's just cheaper than the regional blends they have

13:39 < bridge> <ar1gin> hi devs, can someone with gpu knowledge assist me in my stupidity please? right so uhh, there is this thing called vertex buffer and the gpu draws triangles using it, i can also attach uniform buffer for camera/lighting/etc but can i update vertex buffer? like what if i want to draw arbitrary triangles each frame (lets say about mm <250-500 of them)? and if i can update vertex buffer how slow is that? or am i doing the wrong way??? please i can't fi
13:41 < bridge> <k2d222> generally if you want to update your vertices you have to rebuild your vertex buffer, and it's okay to do so. if you hit performance issues, then you may want to think about other approaches that minimize cpu->gpu memory transfer. how many vertices are we talking about?
13:42 < bridge> <k2d222> so you said <500, that's not too much
13:42 < bridge> <ar1gin> not that much, i am thinking of developing a small 2d game for my phone
13:42 < bridge> <ar1gin> and uhh, i also went for implementing my own graphics üëç
13:43 < bridge> <k2d222> gl on that üôÇ its very challenging but can also be very rewarding üôÇ
13:43 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :gigachad: :pepeW:
13:43 < bridge> <ar1gin> thanks for answering :heartw::heartw::heartw:
13:43 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Did u check my game?!?!
13:43 < bridge> <ar1gin> which one
13:43 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> If it deserves to be called a game
13:44 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/diagonals
13:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> @ar1gin u use rust right
13:44 < bridge> <ar1gin> with wgpu
13:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know ur using opengl but if u want to learn vulkan https://vulkano.rs/
13:44 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> .
13:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> they got a lot of tutorial
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In integrated gpus u could in theory have another advantage that the memory does not require a copy
13:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> With opengl i always found rebuilding the whole buffer faster than updating it. So pre allocation not worth it
13:46 < bridge> <ar1gin> i wanna make a game for my phone because google play is filled with powerconsuming garbage so i need a crossplatform compilation and wgpu says it can compile on pretty much any platform
13:47 < bridge> <ar1gin> is this the continuation of your opengl adventures?
13:48 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> @ar1gin yea
13:48 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Thats final result and i dont touch graphics
13:48 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Ever
13:48 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :pepeW:
13:48 < bridge> <ar1gin> you know, implementing graphics from scratch is a hard milestone, so you should be proud that you were able to do it üëç
13:49 < bridge> <ar1gin> lets see if it compiles on my machine
13:50 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :justatest:
13:51 < bridge> <ar1gin> hmm
13:51 < bridge> <ar1gin> imgui
13:51 < bridge> <ar1gin> seems interesting
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> no imgui!
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> evil sinful library
13:51 < bridge> <Ewan> wasteful
13:51 < bridge> <ar1gin> w
13:51 < bridge> <ar1gin> whay
13:51 < bridge> <ar1gin> its cool
13:51 < bridge> <ar1gin> and fast
13:52 < bridge> <ar1gin> and its rlly easy to define ui in code
13:52 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> I liked it :feelsbadman:
13:52 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Btw press space, only then u can click on cells
13:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> @ar1gin u use rust
13:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> so use egui
13:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/emilk/egui
13:53 < bridge> <ar1gin> i know about egui
13:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> egui is rust imgui
13:53 < bridge> <ar1gin> yeah yeah
13:53 < bridge> <ar1gin> i used it
13:53 < bridge> <ar1gin> a lot
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> dear imgui is fine
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> for an imgui library
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's not a good type of ui imo
13:54 < bridge> <ar1gin> wait
13:54 < bridge> <ar1gin> isnt egui and imgui the same thing?
13:55 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Time to back to demo stuff :pepeW:
13:56 < bridge> <ar1gin> im still struggling to compile it üòÖ
13:56 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :pepeW:
13:56 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Works on my machine
13:57 < bridge> <ar1gin> is it for windows?
13:57 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> No
13:57 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :p
13:57 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Did u use --recursive?
13:57 < bridge> <ar1gin> ok that means the problem is me
13:58 < bridge> <ar1gin> it's not able to find glm for some reason..
13:59 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :pepeW:
14:00 < bridge> <ar1gin> k fixed it
14:00 < bridge> <ar1gin> cmakefiles is borked
14:00 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> A gg
14:02 < bridge> <ar1gin> ```diff
14:02 < bridge> <ar1gin> -add_subdirectory(dependencies/glm)
14:02 < bridge> <ar1gin> +include_directories(dependencies/glm)
14:02 < bridge> <ar1gin> ```
14:02 < bridge> <ar1gin> this fixed it for me
14:02 < bridge> <ar1gin> you might want to look into this issue
14:03 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Maybe i was changing stuff between commits and fucked everything up
14:03 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :justatest:

14:04 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Its between 2 players
14:04 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> No one can take it
14:04 < bridge> <ar1gin> oh
14:04 < bridge> <ar1gin> hold uyp i thought this was a different game
14:05 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> XD
14:10 < bridge> <Ewan> add_subdirectory will add a cmake project in said dir
14:10 < bridge> <Ewan> include_directories will add all the headers in that directory to the global include paths (so you can use it with `<example.h>`)
14:11 < bridge> <Ewan> typically you would want to do `target_include_directories(project PRIVATE dir)` in order to avoid polluting the global include paths
14:11 < bridge> <Ewan> same for linking libraries but for different reasons
14:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Will you also make it look nice? Xd
14:12 < bridge> <ar1gin> i will try my best <3
14:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm something of an artist myself
14:12 < bridge> <ar1gin> oh if you're talking about the art then yes of course
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I always find it hard to make it not look like trash but be very energy efficient. E.g. cool shaders will cost resources. Gifs etc. Are resolution and often framerate dependent so that kinda sucks too ^^
14:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Are you an artist?
14:14 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
14:14 < bridge> <ar1gin> not that much, i'm bad at any form of art, but if i take my time....
14:14 < bridge> <ar1gin> im probably gonna leave post proc. out because of that
14:15 < bridge> <ar1gin> post processing is not always better
14:15 < bridge> <ar1gin> sometimes you can create a picture that looks beautiful even without 1000x bloom
14:16 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> I know that üôÇ
14:16 < bridge> <Ewan> üòÉ
14:16 < bridge> <Ewan> congratulations
14:16 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> But somehow there was add_sybdirectories :pepeW:
14:16 < bridge> <Ewan> idk how much c/cpp u know so i just want to help whenever i can
14:16 < bridge> <ar1gin> btw for anyone looking for phone games, i can recommend "slice & dice"
14:16 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> I know basically 0
14:17 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> üòé
14:17 < bridge> <ar1gin> really good and really optimized
14:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I can't quite put my finger on it, but somethings seems off ü§î
14:20 < bridge> <Ewan> is this the rare heinrich5991 joke
14:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> emulating pattern matching in languages that don't support it
14:24 < bridge> <patiga> here ya go :)
14:24 < bridge> <patiga> trivia: did you know, that...
14:24 < bridge> <patiga> 1. the sunbeams on dm1 are colored with envelopes to make them less bright?
14:24 < bridge> <patiga> 2. the sun is transparent and the beams are actually quite chaotic and leave a hole in the middle of the sun? its not as bad as here, but once you know, you'll see it every time ü´†
14:24 < bridge> <patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1165989066572046386/2023-10-23-142126_1920x1080_scrot.png?ex=6548daf0&is=653665f0&hm=f0b860ff5b0629a7f8f4e1f6aae72645cce1f37dc3cc2fcd477fdd52a6a3ed84&
14:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > the sun is transparent and the beams are actually quite chaotic and leave a hole in the middle of the sun?
14:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thank you for ruining dm1 for me
14:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What r u working on now? Porting ddnet to godot?
14:26 < bridge> <patiga> the original :)
14:26 < bridge> <patiga> its more subtle than I remember
14:26 < bridge> <patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1165989521268154449/2023-10-23-142523_692x651_scrot.png?ex=6548db5c&is=6536665c&hm=e16fc8682ad66d9eaf7b26d975105991feb4337a691efed19b9baa3e658f6972&
14:26 < bridge> <patiga> yea, was curious how long that would take
14:26 < bridge> <patiga> maybe its just procrastination for my bachelor thesis üôÉ
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And what is your current time
14:27 < bridge> <patiga> wdym with current time?
14:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Time spent
14:28 < bridge> <patiga> my fourth day on it, maybe 4 h each day? I didn't actually track the time
14:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And did u write custom shaders or only use godot one
14:29 < bridge> <patiga> its actually the third time I have now reimplemented drawing tw/ddnet maps xd: blender, twgpu, godot
14:29 < bridge> <patiga> I'll need to write a custom shader for quads + envelopes I think
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So it does support tile maps?
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And every time different approach xd
14:30 < bridge> <patiga> yes, but its very different, large maps take quite some time to process
14:30 < bridge> <patiga> not super long, but like 10 seconds I think, haven't tested much yet
14:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Every method has advantages and disadvantages ^^
14:31 < bridge> <patiga> yea ^^
14:31 < bridge> <patiga> the whole map construction is done with rust bindings tho ^^
14:31 < bridge> <patiga> they work quite well
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Hardest part might be to integrate the border extension
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If u plan that
14:31 < bridge> <patiga> yeaaa :/
14:31 < bridge> <patiga> not sure yet how to do that
14:32 < bridge> <patiga> with Godot I could test the perf difference between raycasting tilemaps and doing them the 'native' godot way
14:32 < bridge> <patiga> but thats for another day I think
14:33 < bridge> <patiga> I was honestly hoping I would have mipmaps by now, but there are some confusing things along the way
14:33 < bridge> <patiga> I'm honestly not sure if I'll even get mipmaps for the tilemaps
14:33 < bridge> <patiga> would suck
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well Godot supports gles2 right?
14:34 < bridge> <patiga> yea
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I assume they don't use texture arrays
14:34 < bridge> <patiga> they are atlasses I think
14:34 < bridge> <patiga> I checked the box for a 1 pixel separation between segments of the atlas
14:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah
14:36 < bridge> <patiga> btw, is your Rust renderer public yet? if not, could I maybe get access to it? I'd like to take a look into its workings :)
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I can later push the current state
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do u only want the front end?
14:37 < bridge> <patiga> I wanna see the rendering code
14:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Like the vulkan stuff or just higher level stuff?
14:37 < bridge> <patiga> both would be nice :)
14:38 < bridge> <patiga> is it structured like the ddnet rendering code?
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok. U can get both, but I'm still in a brainstorming phase for the vk backend, so it's not really final.. wont matter too much for tile rendering. But like everything around it xd
14:39 < bridge> <patiga> (hmm, if I have sufficient trust in the renderer, I might just be able to just extend all borders by like 100 or 200 tiles and call it a day ü§î)
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sadly this will contain bugs tho
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'd really love to do that for ddnet
14:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But e.g. aim maps use single tiles for backgrounds(by abusing the auto extend)
14:40 < bridge> <patiga> doesn't really matter that it's not final. because its just a rendering challenge which I've already poured some thoughts into and I think I'll learn some stuff from seeing how someone does it who knows what they are doing ^^
14:43 < bridge> <patiga> the aim maps seem to all use a 2x2 tile background, must be some other map series
14:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah ok but 2x2 doesn't make it better
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If they are 1000 tiles
14:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Visible for over 1000 tiles*
14:44 < bridge> <patiga> they aren't extended at the borders though
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what? how that
14:45 < bridge> <patiga> maybe we just fade to black at the borders of a map :D
14:45 < bridge> <patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1165994374597988402/2023-10-23-144513_1920x1080_scrot.png?ex=6548dfe2&is=65366ae2&hm=7bde7f454df50e4b2c4efbd7fa525bb9513064bcb0792a3cf4d141e3c8f6788c&
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> keep in mind that extending is not related to game layer
14:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the 2x2 will extend directly (after the 2x2 tiles ^^)
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for the rest of the map
14:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what i want to say is: you cannot ujst extend them by 200-300.. u need to extend them over the whole visible area
14:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they don't use parallax afaik
14:47 < bridge> <patiga> I'm not in entities here, those are the 2x2 tiles, the layers have an empty border
14:47 < bridge> <patiga> but yea
14:47 < bridge> <patiga> the issue will be there on maps that use that specific nieche
14:48 < bridge> <patiga> eh, those edges sure are annoying
14:48 < bridge> <patiga> maybe I'll fall back to the raycasting in the end, because I won't have to worry there xd
14:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did u even solve this on twgpu? cant remember
14:49 < bridge> <patiga> I started with Godot because I hoped for faster development, and being actually able to develop a small app that could easily run on mobile phones
14:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess once u are fluent in godot this is true üòÑ
14:50 < bridge> <patiga> I did raytracing: a signgle quad always covering the entire viewport. the tilemap uploaded as a texture. then I map the screen coordinates to the tilemap coordinates, clamp to the limits of the tilemap and sample the tilemap and the tile array texture right after
14:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> its obviously true
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> godot provides lot of things out of the box
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> its a engine xd
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say it's 99% true
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://twitter.com/passivestar_
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> fun follow
14:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> he posts blender  and godot stuff
14:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a big engine always has the disadvantage that it doesn't let you integrate easily into every aspect of it
14:51 < bridge> <teero777> Smooth scrolling in console is already implemented yea?
14:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> somewhere there is an abstraction that limits you

14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice hack
14:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://vxtwitter.com/passivestar_/status/1714526775156326770
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> look
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> this guy is insane
14:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is godot
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> neat
14:55 < bridge> <Ewan> very cool
14:55 < bridge> <Ewan> but how's the perf
14:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean godot will be quite optimized for PBR, so most light effects will be fast
14:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/RodZill4/material-maker
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> more interesting would be use of raytracing
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://vxtwitter.com/passivestar_/status/1715199217633841600
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i feel like unreal engine currently has a monopoly on public avaialable engines
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> godot can only improve
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> its currently in a nice place also relogic is a sponsor
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1165997651116949596/image.png?ex=6548e2ef&is=65366def&hm=f6c407dd3d2b23cb413c154cfddf6d387b099da92300cafc98785ffe372182f4&
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah, terraria is a sponsor
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it must be good for 3d
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just showed u 3d godot
14:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> the joke is that godot 2 sucked hard
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> but 4 is nice
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah was just a joke xd
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the meme lives on
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> the pog thing about godot being open source is these tools
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> popping up everywhere
14:59 < bridge> <patiga> @jupeyy_keks I'm a bit unsure how I should implement the envelopes. does a envelope-values-1d-texture which the quads sample from in the vertex shader sound bad to you in any way? Godot doesn't really tell me how I should update my own gpu buffers (It doesn't actually provide me with non-const-sized-gpu-buffers I think, but 2d-textures-used-as-1d-textures could fill that gap)
14:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> and the physics addons etc
15:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://twitter.com/MegaCrit/status/1713793866779042272
15:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> these guys made slay the spire
15:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah SSIL is their GI method, then indeed i wonder about performance and how well it looks compared to unreal üòÑ
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> wats SSIL xd
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> it also says SGDFI
15:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Signed distance field global illumination (SDFGI) is a novel technique available in Godot 4.0. It provides semi-real-time global illumination that scales to any world size and works with procedurally generated levels. SDFGI supports dynamic lights, but not dynamic occluders or dynamic emissive surfaces.
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> uff, tbh i have no idea. using textures sounds like a hack, but if godot doesn't give u anything better i guess u have no other choice?
15:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my fear with sampling stuff is that drivers can always override its behavior üòÑ
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Screen-space indirect lighting (SSIL):
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     The SSIL quality and number of blur passes can be adjusted in the Project Settings. By default, SSIL rendering is performed at half resolution (and then linearly scaled) to ensure a reasonable performance level. Not available when using the Forward Mobile or Compatibility backends.
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://docs.godotengine.org/de/4.x/tutorials/3d/global_illumination/introduction_to_global_illumination.html
15:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> what does unreal use?
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno they call it lumen or smth
15:05 < bridge> <patiga> ah, thanks for the brain storming/a bit rubber-ducking, I'll try some stuff out
15:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i don't think there is anything comparable
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki the most important thing in UE5 is Nanite.. so their GI etc. has to integrate with that technology
15:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's why u can't really compare it to anything else i think. it's simply a new approach
15:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> copy the aproach
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> üò¨
15:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true xd
15:12 < bridge> <Ewan> i am incredibly surprised they don't have more sponsors. i guess you have to be more explicitly linux-oriented to get support from all the big names which usually sponsor oss projects like this
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> smth rly weird happening
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> im compiling a project with rust
15:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i OOM
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just added a bench binary
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> odd stuff
15:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill use less jobs
15:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> linux foundation decided to sponsor https://github.com/o3de/o3de
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe smth rly big in there
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> instead of godot
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for WHATEVER reason xd
15:15 < bridge> <Ewan> probably some quarrel
15:15 < bridge> <Ewan> wrong license or wrong philosophy or they don't like a top contributor
15:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u use it
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no, i just heard it's amazons game engine, which makes sense since many contributors have amazon in their name
15:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its cool to have alternatives and its open source
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, idc too much tbh üòÑ
15:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> godot profited most of the unity problems...  at least from the open source engines
15:17 < bridge> <Ewan> amazon's got their fingers in everything
15:30 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> @ar1gin it build for me even without that glm line at all
15:31 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :thonk:
15:31 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> @ar1gin it builds for me even without that glm line at all
15:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> r u under linux?
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> & do u inlcude glm headers with #include <glm/...>
15:35 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ü§ì
15:35 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1166006892364038194/image.png?ex=6548eb8a&is=6536768a&hm=2716cb891a5d51a24997b05200c6b54bcf852df29946b42765a401dbd05c7887&
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it's quite likely that the /usr/includes is already in the path, that's why u dont need it
15:35 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i still didnt install right drivers :feelsbadman:
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it might not compile under windows then tho
15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> whats your problem with your drivers?
15:35 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> there bad
15:36 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> theyre bad
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nvidia?
15:36 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> yea
15:36 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i install neuvau or whatever the hell
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rip
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's probably better to use zink globally xd
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then u have the power of mesa, while u have the driver of nvidia
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> assuming u install  the nvidia drivers at some point
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and no i have never tested that, but would be a funny experiment
15:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with AMD drivers on KDE i had no real issues
15:38 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> yea i do, and i also have this line include_directories(dependencies)
15:38 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> and dependencies folder has glm, i though that has to work
15:38 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :p
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess u have glm installed over a package manager
15:39 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> if i remove it from dependencies folder it should work anyways
15:39 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> right?
15:39 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> if i have it installed
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
15:40 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ok it does :feelsbadman:
15:40 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i dont remember installing it
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can't remember installing any of the 7000 packages out of 7100 packages on my system xdd
15:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> would be nice if there was a better solution to this
15:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I also run into this sometimes
15:50 < bridge> <syrinok> Joke's on you, I have to go to the DMV again today
15:51 < bridge> <syrinok> :pepeW:
15:53 < bridge> <teero777> yo I have a logical question. if I have an array of 2d vectors and I chose one of them at random. How would I figure out the nearest vector to the left and to the right side?
15:55 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ok i fixed and now it has a release :poggers:
15:55 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1166011984358162473/image.png?ex=6548f048&is=65367b48&hm=26a3bc05aae9b79c4cd831d8d31278b73b4c7f813f4a304f56815668668af28d&
15:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> wdym by "left" and "right"?
15:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just with a lower/higher x coordinate?
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> buy more ram xd
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i ran out of memory on 32GB lately, when compiling something on arch
15:57 < bridge> <teero777> Sry for the poor quality ethernet port broke on my PC. The green vector is the randomly selected ones and the red ones are the ones that I want
15:57 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1166012519341629640/IMG_20231023_155624896.jpg?ex=6548f0c8&is=65367bc8&hm=f2de0e551e843a240781cfb7026dfe8e457ec1226ff222b8c3b2a23edb8edb1c&
15:58 < bridge> <Ewan> my condolences
16:00 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> do you know whats the name of this color scheme? xd
16:00 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1166013268716965919/image.png?ex=6548f17a&is=65367c7a&hm=e9ce0e608eb975ac2baa25692e830b9a88f2d58937822e7be51cb5ae884f9604&
16:00 < bridge> <Ewan> not off the top of my head
16:00 < bridge> <Ewan> solarized maybe
16:00 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> anybody knows whats the name of this color scheme? xd
16:00 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1166013268716965919/image.png?ex=6548f17a&is=65367c7a&hm=e9ce0e608eb975ac2baa25692e830b9a88f2d58937822e7be51cb5ae884f9604&
16:00 < bridge> <Ewan> (dark)
16:00 < bridge> <Ewan> nvm
16:01 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> ive already seen it but cant remember the name :feelsbadman:
16:01 < bridge> <furo321> Gruvbox, I guess
16:01 < bridge> <Ewan> not dissimilar to mabakor
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so u basically want to see if the dot product is positive or negative?
16:01 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> yep
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or how should i interpret that?
16:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or the angle?
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but left and right in 3d is really weird
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u kinda want a projection of the vector first? but into which direction?
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a single red vector does not create a plane
16:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or the x y plane? xd
16:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what jupstar says, I'm still not sure what you mean by left and right
16:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why is the gray one not left or right?
16:04 < bridge> <teero777> I only want the nearest ones
16:04 < bridge> <teero777> So the nearest one on the left and the nearest one on the roght
16:04 < bridge> <teero777> I only want the nearest ones
16:04 < bridge> <teero777> So the nearest one on the left and the nearest one on the right
16:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what if it's above it?
16:05 < bridge> <teero777> The vectors are normalised
16:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the problem is simply, left and right doesn't work like that in 3d xD
16:05 < bridge> <teero777> It's 2d bro
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this img is 2d too?
16:06 < bridge> <teero777> Y
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my brain has hard time parsing that xD
16:06 < bridge> <teero777> The colors are for what I want and what I have xd
16:06 < bridge> <teero777> I have the green
16:06 < bridge> <teero777> I want the red
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well in 2d simply check the x coordinate?
16:06 < bridge> <teero777> Its a circle
16:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> then select the vector with the minimum distance that has a higher x coordinate?
16:06 < bridge> <teero777> Well no
16:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how is the grey one not closer than the left red one?
16:07 < bridge> <teero777> Closer by angle
16:07 < bridge> <teero777> The length doesn't mean anything
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i c
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so sin & cos are ur friends here
16:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle
16:09 < bridge> <teero777> But taking angle diffs are annoying asf
16:10 < bridge> <teero777> since there are always 2 answers
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but u know which vector is closer to 1, 0
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok i am thinking too mathematically rn anyway, u probably need a very fast approach
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet u can somehow abuse the dot product for this
16:13 < bridge> <teero777> Just getting the closest vector is easy but I need 2 of em
16:14 < bridge> <teero777> Ah wait I have an idea
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but if u know one, and it's coordinate, u just need to seek out for another that as coordinates that are on the other side
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and u can search for the closest vector of red to green, instead of green to red
16:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but if u know one, and its coordinate, u just need to seek out for another that as coordinates that are on the other side
16:18 < bridge> <Ewan> @_voxeldoesart were u planning to submit a pr for #7312? i was looking for stuff to knock out and it seems pretty ez but if u had plans then i'll find something else
16:18 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7312
16:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that yellow website is also the hell xDD
16:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > The whole webpage/SQL database architecture is built on a premise (hope, even) that nobody will touch your data while you look at the rendered webpage.
16:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I also struggled with that one while writing a website
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why is that a problem? i dont understand.. bcs scriptlanguages?
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> security reasons?
16:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you display a resource that a user can edit
16:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> multiple users might open the same page, get presented the same data
16:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> one user changes field a, the other field b
16:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you naively just update everything when the users submit, one of these changes ist going to be lost
16:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you naively just update everything when the users submit, one of these changes is going to be lost
16:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh yeah
16:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @teero777 found a solution?
16:35 < bridge> <teero777> yea I think I did
16:35 < bridge> <teero777> Gotta test first
16:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think u could do it with a fast cross product(using z achsis for 90¬∞) and using the dot product xd
16:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and it involves no sin, cos or sqrt
16:50 < bridge> <learath2> This is an excellent blog post. He put into decent words everything I've been thinking for years
16:51 < bridge> <Ewan> thing about this post is i've read so many like it that i'm not sure if i've read this one specifically before
16:51 < bridge> <Ewan> you'd think i'd remember the yellow
16:51 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao this troll dark mode
16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> having dealt with the javascript(typescript) universe a bit i can ensure you, it's even worse than u think xD
16:55 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> uh yea sure u can do that
16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i swear these frameworks are always broken af, and never gonna be fixed. they slow, they tend to not work after a while
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> wish the world was made in rust
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
16:56 < bridge> <learath2> You know whats even scarier to me? I know a couple people going into the industry right around now and they actually don't see an issue with it
16:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> im just hoping wasm can finally do DOM and we get rid of js
16:57 < bridge> <learath2> It seems to be getting more and more normal
16:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> static linking is also a tradeoff, unfortunately
16:57 < bridge> <Ewan> well this is what they are taught by their professors
16:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah it's sad tbh. i always hate the debugging session that lead to nowhere except you saying" probably a framework problem and not in my code"
16:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think that comes up in lectures
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u don't even know if that's true
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but u cannot really expect anything else.. they are basically not reproducable etc
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's also one of the issues i see with CSS. there are 20000 ways to do the same
16:58 < bridge> <learath2> Since I have a very obsessive personality, I do end up all the way inside the framwork for these bugs to confirm it's definitely not my fault
16:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and nobody understands why it works xD
16:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well depends on the framework size i guess, but that's actually a good thing to do xd
16:59 < bridge> <Ewan> no way to know if this is true as i'm not in any kind of cs or ce course, but i think the general sentiment of doing things faster as opposed to 'correctly' would really shine through
17:00 < bridge> <Ewan> if that's what the industry is doing, there are bound to be a certain number of people who think this way. and a portion of those ppl would be professors or colleagues
17:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this is far weaker than the initial statement
17:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> "there are also professors who think this is okay"
17:01 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> javascipt is like, the only language im fluent in LOL
17:01 < bridge> <learath2> It delays results though. Which is all that matters to bean counters and the new generation. A working MVP immediately that they tell themselves they will definitely improve on but never do
17:01 < bridge> <teero777> english :owo:
17:02 < bridge> <learath2> Who cares if one of our dependencies is pulling in a version of mongodb and another pulling in another making our bundle double the size. MVP needs to be out yesterday, why are you wasting time debugging that?
17:02 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yes thats what language i speak
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well, it makes a bit of sense to want a working mvp to get money flowing rather than waiting to have that perfect software u may never reach while wasting funds
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> its all a balance i guess
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> and it depends a lot on how much ucan wait as a company
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> today Ryozuki the capitalist
17:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> tomorrow the comunbist
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> tomorrow the comunist
17:05 < bridge> <learath2> Money is a perverse incentive, it's almost always in conflict with good engineering
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats why free software is so good
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can sense the dedication
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> and the true craftsmanship
17:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
17:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet :justatest:
17:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> unfortunately it often isn't üò¶
17:07 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> if ppl got paid to program for ddnet then i bet itd be cooler
17:07 < bridge> <Ewan> depends
17:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> well there is lots
17:08 < bridge> <learath2> I never said no money incentive implies good software üòÑ
17:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> but good free software is usually better than the counterpart
17:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like to believe blender is good
17:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:09 < bridge> <learath2> Blender is excellent. If only their competition didn't have war chests the size of a small countries budget marketing their products
17:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hats!
17:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> or loot boxes or whatever we call them these days
17:10 < bridge> <learath2> We should cave and sell capes and colored names and hats
17:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> today its battlepass
17:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> every game has it
17:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> valve created it
17:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> i been playing diabl o4
17:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> diablo 4
17:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has battlepass xd
17:10 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :justatest:
17:10 < bridge> <Ewan> im at that point of tiredness that i'm hallucinating phone dings
17:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> go sleep
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> where
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> no
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> can't
17:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> i go get coffee
17:11 < bridge> <learath2> Sleep
17:11 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Can i have twerking twinbop for $9.99
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> i need to fix my sleep schedule
17:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw i got a rice cooker and i can say they are nice
17:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> best way to lazy cook
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> yea it was a game changer
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> when i got mine
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> suddenly i can make good dinner in 30 mins
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> set up rice, halfway thru its cooking throw some chicken in the air fryer, basically 0 maintenance food
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> and it's good
17:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont have air fryer
17:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well i dont want one
17:12 < bridge> <Ewan> they're gret
17:12 < bridge> <Ewan> they're great
17:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> do air fryer not use oil
17:12 < bridge> <Ewan> they can
17:12 < bridge> <Ewan> most stuff doesn't need it
17:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> so its like cooking chicken on a pan with almost no oil?
17:12 < bridge> <Ewan> but some recipes advise u drizzle oil on there
17:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> its what i do
17:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> non stick pans
17:12 < bridge> <Ewan> yea they are without oil in nature
17:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> i see
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it healthier?
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:13 < bridge> <Ewan> well it has less oil than most other methods so yea
17:13 < bridge> <Ewan> it's just hot air
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i see maybe i get one
17:13 < bridge> <Ewan> it's sorta like microwave if it didn't make most food either too chewy or too hard in the worst ways possible
17:14 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what would ddnet battlepass even be like for an open source game
17:14 < bridge> <louis> air fryers are really nice
17:15 < bridge> <louis> if u want good tasting unhealthy food ü§£
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> WTF
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> trolled
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> speaking of im gonna go throw something in
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> me hungry
17:17 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> sprays mabye idk. Would need to add them first though
17:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i threw in chicken nuggets
17:19 < bridge> <Ewan> not great but it's what we have
17:19 < bridge> <Ewan> i nuke some broccoli too
17:20 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i mean
17:20 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> whats stopping ppl from making clients that bypass the payment system
17:20 < bridge> <Ewan> the server
17:21 < bridge> <Ewan> they would undoubtedly need to be on the same page about who paid
17:21 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> accounts :justatest:
17:21 < bridge> <Ewan> which to do with any integrity would require accounts yea
17:21 < bridge> <reitw> implement fortnite dances for tees
17:21 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> true!
17:22 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ppl keep telling me that
17:22 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> id love to but    why
17:22 < bridge> <reitw> just  a joke
17:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's stopping people from teleporting in maps? the same thing
17:25 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i mean the thing is i thought u meant battlepass as in "custom skins or weapons n stuff"
17:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's still the same thing: other people won't see your cool skins by default unless you pay up
17:26 < bridge> <louis> just implement a system for weapon skins as we have for player skins and sell those ü§ëü§ë
17:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> similar to other games
17:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> people can ofc show themselves other skins
17:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but that doesn't seem to have the same effect on people
17:28 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont think ppl care about if others see them. why do you think ppl play with skins not on any database
17:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I estimate that less than 10% of the people do that
17:31 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> still
17:31 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ppl are gonna fork ddnet to bypass these payment systems
17:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> betterdiscord exists
17:32 < bridge> <Ewan> it wouldn't work on official servers tho
17:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont think ppl care
17:32 < bridge> <Ewan> no it would actually like not be possible
17:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i wouldnt
17:32 < bridge> <louis> yeah but the majority won't which is the point
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga 
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/dd-pg/tree/test5
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga do u want to compile it too?
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or just look through the code
17:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> don't use or read this code :kek:
17:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's a mess
17:33 < bridge> <patiga> just look through the code
17:33 < bridge> <patiga> thanks! :)
17:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> doesn't matter, you see people paying for discord nitro
17:34 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> betas
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga these are the map related things
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/dd-pg/tree/test5/game/client-render-base/src/map
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is the "front end" stuff (stuff that isnt vk)
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/dd-pg/blob/test5/game/client-render-base/src/map/map.rs
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is the stuff inside vk:
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/dd-pg/blob/test5/lib/graphics-backend/src/backends/vulkan/vulkan.rs#L325-L361
17:36 < bridge> <patiga> this project is huge o.o
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it has grown quite a bit already
17:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and still i am only at like 40% vanilla xd
17:36 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> tf
17:36 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> is this trying to be the image splitter thing
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/dd-pg/tree/test5/game/client-extra/src
17:37 < bridge> <Ewan> holy shit you're about to get sued
17:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> here are the splitters xD
17:37 < bridge> <patiga> "only 40%"
17:38 < bridge> <patiga> so you are basically reimplementing the entire ddnet codebase? or what is the project? ^^
17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say i reimplement teeworlds, but keep racing in mind
17:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i didn't really implement any ddnet physics related stuff yet
17:39 < bridge> <louis> rustworlds?
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
17:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for voxel our rust fan
17:40 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> mine is still better because i made it myself....
17:40 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> and also reorganized everything
17:42 < bridge> <patiga> you are crazy @jupeyy_keks :D
17:43 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> its gonna be a metaverse type thing where it shills rust everywhere like its the next blockchain update or smth
17:44 < bridge> <louis> erm
17:44 < bridge> <louis> rust is a strong modern language with amazing features centered around safety and security ü§ì
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u want serious WASM support u have like c++ or rust as choices
17:46 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> what do you think about an option in settings which allow to sync main tee color and dummy :thonk:
17:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so why waste time using c++ again
17:47 < bridge> <teero777> I have no idea
17:47 < bridge> <louis> i think copy/paste color code button would be nice
17:48 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> because ddnet used c++ and how else was i supposed to make updates
17:48 < bridge> <louis> rustworlds.io???
17:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @teero777 try this
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u take the cross product of green
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then u take the cross product of any vec, and the dot product with green
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the closer the dot product is to 1 the closer the vec
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with the cross products of the "any" vec and green vec u can see if it's left or right
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the dot product of these cross products is positive its left, else right
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think xdd
17:50 < bridge> <louis> convert to polar and sort by angle
17:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd the next io game
17:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wanted to give him a solution without sin, cos etc.
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno, i find rust not MUCH harder than cpp
17:52 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> didnt know in ddnet there's fav skin feature xD
17:52 < bridge> <louis> i see
17:52 < bridge> <louis> seems tricky
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but did u know u can skip the main menu üò¨
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet nobody here knows all features of ddnet
17:54 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> i read about it before
17:54 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i guess but thats only because i i only know how to copypaste other code from ddnet to make things
17:54 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i guess but thats because i i only know how to copypaste other code from ddnet to make things
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xddd
17:57 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> "ddnet in a nutshell", as zogtib would say xD
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's why i introduced a clear hierarchy
17:58 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ddnet's the Most Fun to program idk why
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to prevent this from happening again in such a mess style
17:59 < bridge> <louis> ddnet is not fun to write code for üíÄ
17:59 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i tried finding other open source games but none are rly        good looking
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 0ad
18:00 < bridge> <teero777> Can't think rn
18:00 < bridge> <teero777> Gonna screenshot that and think about it tmrw. thx
18:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks did u feel job dev burnout yet
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's ez to understand if u visualize what i'm doin xd
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> want my honest or my humble answer?
18:05 < bridge> <teero777> brain is split in half
18:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
18:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> i feel like today has been rly stressful for me xD
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> such a programmer answer to my question xD
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I SEE "OR"
18:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> xD
18:07 < bridge> <patiga> have you seen mindustry? its neat :)
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> question is, was it stressful but u still did a lot?
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or was it stressful and u still didnt achieve anything
18:07 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i tried playing that but dropped out of it
18:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ozu laser is also supposedly good ^^
18:07 < bridge> <teero777> don't lure him away from tw :pepeW:
18:08 < bridge> <patiga> in Veloren you probably have the most freedom, since could influence the direction where the game is going
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mindustry only makes fun for 1 day anyway xD
18:08 < bridge> <patiga> I like to encourage coding :D
18:09 < bridge> <louis> veloren is cool but barebones for sure
18:09 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you meant osu right? or
18:09 < bridge> <louis> unfortunately i couldnt really make my character a cute girl so i didnt play for too long
18:09 < bridge> <patiga> true, but visually its nice. zooming out is amazing
18:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i did a lot i think but the stress lingers
18:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> the problem with me is i think im someone who gets too involved in stuff
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> could simply be a bad day or week
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u start doing less, then u in the burn out
18:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> so im also then the one on the receiving end if something is not that ok
18:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> because i talk a lot
18:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:10 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> veloren was the case study for what i meant by "none looked fun"
18:10 < bridge> <teero777> there is an easy fix for that
18:10 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ryozuki tried to reccomend but it looked boring and grindy
18:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just mentioned it
18:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> it looks boring indeed
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i played it for 1 day xd
18:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> its hard to make nice gameplay loops
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it is boring after a while
18:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need game designers for that not engineers
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but beautiful xd
18:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> dw it's boring. I liked to find exploits in it though
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the zooming is epic xd
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i did it like every 5 minutes
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just to doit
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just to do it
18:12 < bridge> <patiga> it really is addicting
18:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> apparently osu lazer
18:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> didn't remember where the z goes ^^
18:13 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont rly like osu :justatest:
18:14 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> fun times xD
18:14 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1166046941814202408/Haw2.mp4?ex=654910d7&is=65369bd7&hm=7f8fee6c8a3d4c4b503858d8d1903885957b0fd1a3c8fb59b38cdc561bdc9ae1&
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ghosy the minecraft king also pro in other survival games
18:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xdd
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc server is not open source
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks u didnt answer
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> a yes to an OR question means yes to both
18:16 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> me when cyberfighter forces me to grind in xpanic
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no xD
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it means at least one condition is true
18:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> tell me honest then
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i never really took my job serious enough to call it burnout, but i guess u could say that is already some kind of burnout xD
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i find my job rather boring
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess my problem is i think of it now as i depend on it
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> before i lived alone iwas like ye idc
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> but now i have the little fear of losing my job and since i live alone it can be a problem
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can certainly believe that is one problem
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i currently luckely have no money problem
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> its mainly what stresses me out when smth troublesome happens
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i feel rather safe
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean i also have savings
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> and i get daily offers on linkedin
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think im safe
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u never know xd
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can ensure u it's normal
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i had serious burnouts in the past. then u really can't work on anything anymore
18:23 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> safe? rust refere
18:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ic
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah thanks rust, our lord and savior
18:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> read my bio
18:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> "Now i am become Rust, Destroyer of Unsafe code"
18:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> amazing
18:24 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yea yea
18:24 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> im immovable
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @_voxeldoesart good, nice we get closer
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> now the opposite
18:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> apparently there's a third-party server impl: https://github.com/osuAkatsuki/bancho.py
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can move
18:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (TIL)
18:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> like rust variables, immutable by default
18:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> voxel is pinned
18:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> mutable by default is a mistake
18:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> like null pointers
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> generally
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it exists, it should exist
18:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> null pointers are only good for niche optimization, that u dont need to care about
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> less Option = less code to check for
18:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw if u know a value wont ever be 0
18:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u have a option
18:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> use Option<NonZerou64>
18:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> then it will occupy same space as a u64
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
18:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
18:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> use std::mem::size_of;
18:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> assert_eq!(size_of::<Option<core::num::NonZeroU64>>(), size_of::<u64>());
18:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
18:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.NonZeroU64.html
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez optimizations
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe i can actually use it in one place
18:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that abstraction is unfortunately a bit annoying to work with
18:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and it only works for 0
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 check this hack
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/nonmax/0.5.3/nonmax/
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> it works
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>      /// Creates a new non-max if the given value is not the maximum
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>             /// value.
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>             #[inline]
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>             pub const fn new(value: $primitive) -> Option<Self> {
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 match core::num::$non_zero::new(value ^ $primitive::MAX) {
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>                     None => None,
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>                     Some(value) => Some(Self(value)),
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>                 }
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki>             }
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
18:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> they do the complement
18:31 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> to what
18:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u can swap 0 to the value yo uwant
18:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> in this case its MAX
18:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that comes with a perf penalty, unfortunately
18:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rust might eventually support that without the perf penalty, I think
18:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's currently implemented in nightly, I think
18:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah but i think its rly small
18:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think the argument was that its rly rare to use this
18:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> to support it

18:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
18:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> async related
18:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so u cannot be moved
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> immoveable
18:36 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yea thats what i said
18:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm, interesting
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just what u wanted xd
18:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> voxel is a `Pin<Box<dyn Error>>`
18:36 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> and how does this benefit you
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @_voxeldoesart we teach u rust
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html
18:36 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ew what the fuck?
18:36 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> rust dyns in fng?
18:36 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> f3
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
18:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/98407
18:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wish u could remove only the embed image
18:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> but keep text
18:38 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> you mean the pfp?
18:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `rustc_layout_scalar_valid_range_{start,end}`
18:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just the summary text
18:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's what's used to implement the niches @ryozuki
18:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ic
18:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting, `Option<File>` is also 4 byte
18:40 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> rust feels like one of those things where you HAD to have been programming since 2017 with it (before it blew up) to make anything in it
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say the opposite
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's slowly getting usable
18:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for a wider range of ppl
18:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah it can only be used in compiler code yet
18:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> #![allow(internal_features)]
18:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> #![feature(rustc_attrs)]
18:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> requires this
18:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `File` uses `-1` as the niche on linux üôÇ
18:45 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh yea i found the linux github page yesterday
18:45 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> some of the prs are so golden
18:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> linux isn't developed on github AFAIK
18:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so it'd just be a mirror
18:46 < bridge> <reitw> yes but everything is mirrored yes
18:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. the PRs aren't getting looked at
18:46 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh
19:24 < bridge> <emilcha.> Hi looking to build DDNet client on windows, any guide available other than the really limited one on the GitHub ?
19:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> there's also one in the forums
19:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it might be outdated though
19:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://forum.ddnet.org/viewtopic.php?t=5765
19:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you have problems, post them
19:40 < bridge> <Ewan> Linux does not use pull requests at all
19:40 < bridge> <Ewan> They use a mailing list and patches
19:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> bro u gotta mail your update?? üíÄ
19:41 < bridge> <learath2> Old ppl
19:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> fair
19:42 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i can only imagine you storing your changed code in an usb stick and physically mailing it to linus
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> email
19:43 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh yea
19:43 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> forgot emails were a factor
19:43 < bridge> <Ewan> üî•
19:43 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> idk physical mail sounded more fitting for such a niche
19:44 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs tha way
19:46 < bridge> <ladno_t.> how to build a portal in ddnet?
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> portal?
19:47 < bridge> <ladno_t.> yes
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
19:47 < bridge> <Ewan> there are teleports already
19:47 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Portal like in Minecraft?
19:48 < bridge> <ladno_t.> I can't find
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> you should redirect mapping questions to #mapping
19:49 < bridge> <ladno_t.> Ok
20:23 < bridge> <trexic> Im not sure if this is the right channel but I have a quick question to someone who knows cryptography. Is AES-GCM still a save solution to encrypt passwords? Or is there a newer and better mode/algorithm?
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> encrypt passwords for?
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a database?
20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a packet?
20:24 < bridge> <trexic> a database
20:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then it was never a secure solution
20:25 < bridge> <trexic> üôè
20:25 < bridge> <trexic> xD
20:26 < bridge> <trexic> not??
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what you want is a hash function i guess
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with a salt
20:26 < bridge> <trexic> nono it has to be recoverable
20:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
20:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
20:27 < bridge> <learath2> no
20:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no:banhammer:
20:27 < bridge> <trexic> xD
20:27 < bridge> <trexic> I want to see them later.
20:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> nope
20:27 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> no
20:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur asking for bad practises
20:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> we dont do that here
20:27 < bridge> <learath2> Oh for your own passwords?
20:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> altho we do c++
20:27 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
20:28 < bridge> <learath2> Like as in a password manager?
20:28 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> And rust?
20:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> good
20:28 < bridge> <trexic> I need to store them so I can see tham later.
20:28 < bridge> <trexic> y es
20:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> surely for his own
20:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> <a:Sure:1132017487488233472>
20:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah yeah, i also store your paypal password with symmetric encryptions
20:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you're just trying to keep passwords out of people's view, you might just base64-encode them
20:30 < bridge> <trexic> noooooooo
20:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
20:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> otherwise the next question will be why the key for the encryption is safer than your password
20:30 < bridge> <learath2> For a password manager kind of application aes gcm is fine
20:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. what are you trying to do?
20:31 < bridge> <trexic> yes Im trying to do similar stuff like a password manager
20:31 < bridge> <learath2> I would also put a slow kdf in the middle, like argon2
20:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah sure üòè
20:32 < bridge> <learath2> I think argon2id is what‚Äôs popular nowadays
20:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ("where are you getting your encryption key from?")
20:32 < bridge> <trexic> ?
20:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòè
20:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> answer this
20:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is important
20:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> yes i use that
20:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Key_derivation_function&oldid=1169865879#Password_hashing says OWASP says argon2id
20:34 < bridge> <trexic> so I should use that to generate the encryption key of the master key?
20:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what do you want to use for encryption? is it a password? is it randomly generated data?
20:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want to use a password as a key, then yes, such a key derivation function is the way to go
20:35 < bridge> <trexic> good
20:35 < bridge> <trexic> thats what i want
20:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you use randomly generated data, then no, don't use the derivation function
20:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you use randomly generated data, then no, don't use the key derivation function
20:36 < bridge> <trexic> cuz?
20:36 < bridge> <trexic> Just interested
20:36 < bridge> <learath2> No more secure
20:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> takes a second to derive
20:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> useless time spent
20:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> doesn't improve security
20:37 < bridge> <trexic> yeah sure cuz its already secure random
20:37 < bridge> <trexic> ok ok
20:37 < bridge> <trexic> ty
20:37 < bridge> <learath2> We use KDFs to stretch our short passwords into the required size in a slow way
20:37 < bridge> <learath2> You can already generate however many bits needed randomly, so no need to stretch
20:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (and if you have 128 bits, you can stretch that to as many bits as you want, without a kdf)
20:39 < bridge> <trexic> thanks that helped a lot
20:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @trexic what are u coding
20:40 < bridge> <learath2> DDNet bot, but with AES-GCM
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @trexic r u on windows?
20:41 < bridge> <trexic> ye
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did u ever have problems compiling ddnet?
20:41 < bridge> <trexic> no
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> weird
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
20:41 < bridge> <teero777> hahahaha
20:41 < bridge> <teero777> @jupeyy_keks u troll xddd
20:41 < bridge> <trexic> i recently compiled it?
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @trexic so wanna leak what u doin
20:42 < bridge> <trexic> It worked for me after a few tries
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or prefer to keep secret
20:42 < bridge> <trexic> hmm??
20:42 < bridge> <trexic> is anything wrong that it worked? xD shouldnt it?
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean, do you want to share what u coding
20:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean u ask in ddnet dev chat
20:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i assume it's ddnet related?
20:44 < bridge> <trexic> yes ik that im writing to ddnet channel. Thats also why I asked if this is the right channel for that question. No its not for ddnet. It was a general coding question for some projects
20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i c
20:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean that's not forbidden, was just curious
20:45 < bridge> <teero777> the forbidden questions....
20:45 < bridge> <trexic> :Frog087:
20:45 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's okay to ask non-ddnet-related programming questions in this channel
20:45 < bridge> <trexic> gtk
20:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tho other discords might be more appropriate for some questions
20:46 < bridge> <trexic> hmm
20:46 < bridge> <trexic> hard to find some guys which answe that fast
20:46 < bridge> <trexic> also most of them had no idea of crypto
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah ddnet is elite chat anyway üò¨
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> half of rust community is here
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then a guy that knows the c spec by heart
20:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> make that two
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> O.O
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u too?
20:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> not me
20:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> zogtib
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
20:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I am just the middleman xD
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u the machine learning guy
20:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> together with gerdoe
20:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> and Tater
20:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Tater is already shader guy xd
20:55 < bridge> <teero777> Tater is machine learning guy?
20:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :justatest:
20:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> teero is TAS guy
20:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
20:56 < bridge> <teero777> xd
20:56 < bridge> <teero777> New automatic TAS generator coming soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
21:06 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i gotta make more ddnet shader concepts when i get home
21:06 < bridge> <teero777> hyper realistic teeworlds :poggers2:
21:07 < bridge> <teero777> The tee will have simulated hair
21:07 < bridge> <teero777> The tees will have simulated hair
21:07 < bridge> <teero777> haha imagine some ropes sticking out of a tee on top acting like hair xdd
21:07 < bridge> <reitw> no need to optimize dnet when u can implement DLSS 3 & FSR
21:08 < bridge> <reitw> no need to optimize ddnet when u can implement DLSS 3 & FSR
21:08 < bridge> <reitw> :giga_chad:
21:09 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> interactive skins would be awesome
21:09 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> but hard to impliment
21:11 < bridge> <teero777> softbody tees xd
21:11 < bridge> <teero777> You could use some library but that would probably be bloat
21:14 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> im gonna make a ddnet client that has an overengineered skins system
21:14 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> features include: more faces, flipped bodies, layered skins, maybe a tail, maybe a hat, maybe an animated segment
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> great
21:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just gotta learn rust
21:20 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ddnet uses python and c++
21:20 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> no need to learn rust for smth like that
21:21 < bridge> <teero777> It is very essential
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but then u bloat the client instead of using the awesome WASM API
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> also pls remove python xd
21:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's an insult to ddnet
21:21 < bridge> <teero777> Replace with bash üíÄ
21:27 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ok then replace all python files
21:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes pls
21:27 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> when u do that, only then will i start to learn it
21:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
21:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> heinrich is huge pyson fan sadly
21:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and deen likes it too
21:28 < bridge> <teero777> no one needs checksum generation anyways :banhammer:
21:34 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> that sucks
21:39 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> speaking if which
21:39 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what does rust in the ddnet code even do rn
21:40 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> sorry goldfish memory
21:40 < bridge> <reitw> ddnet uses rust too
21:40 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> read
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well nothing xD
21:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the master srv is in rust
21:42 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> LOL
21:42 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ok well the master srv 
21:42 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ok
21:42 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont touch the master srv so
21:43 < bridge> <reitw> https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Addnet%2Fddnet++language%3ARust&type=code
21:43 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ok?
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 4sec extra compile times is the current feature of the rust code
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and the rust code can detect bot creators
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨ üò¨
21:49 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨
21:51 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> like im *interested* but i dont wanna become a cult member
22:14 < bridge> <gerdoe> you are member of anti-rust cult tho
22:14 < bridge> <gerdoe> hm
22:14 < bridge> <gerdoe> actually you are anti-ryo cult member
22:20 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> sounds about right
22:20 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> like id LEARN rust if it meant i got something out of it
22:21 < bridge> <gerdoe> you first need to know what you wanna do
22:21 < bridge> <gerdoe> then you will code it
22:24 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i did want to make an adobe animate mirror that offered better QoL features and overall a better experiencr
22:24 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i did want to make an adobe animate mirror that offered better QoL features and overall a better experience
22:24 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> since .fla files are just zip files under the hood
22:27 < bridge> <gerdoe> so here you go
22:27 < bridge> <gerdoe> take rust, learn .fla format and so on xd
22:28 < bridge> <gerdoe> looks hard tho
22:28 < bridge> <gerdoe> for me atleast, have never used adobe animate
22:30 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i mean most of the fla is in json format
22:31 < bridge> <gerdoe> here you go then xd
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> fla
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @_voxeldoesart i kinda want to see all ur ideas xd
22:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yea afobe animate used to be adobe flash
22:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i am at work i will dump all of my ideas later
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but probably frame dependent?
22:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i have too many
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> me2
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> never ending story
22:32 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i think flash was always frame dependant
22:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh that ofc always sucks xd
22:33 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> true
22:33 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> especially if you're trying to sync to a song
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> teeworlds dance challenge
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> omg
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice
22:33 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> like i know HOW TO do teeworlds animation now
22:33 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> but the system is so jank
22:33 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ...................
22:33 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i still need to program a osudeo accurate teeworlds pose editor
22:34 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ...................
22:34 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i still need to program a psudeo accurate teeworlds pose editor
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah rip xd
22:37 < bridge> <teero777> so can C++ üò¨
22:43 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> teero replace the rust code with the cpp code then
22:43 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :troll:
22:45 < bridge> <teero777> still waiting for carbon
23:10 < bridge> <gerdoe> carbon sucks
