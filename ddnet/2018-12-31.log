00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> idk when
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ive had this problem with every client after 10.6
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and 11 just made it worse
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> just lower fps? no input delay or anything else?
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lower as in < 60? I seriously doubt that
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but yeah, I did also note that my fps went down a couple hundred
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> **noticeably lower fps**
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> this is not acceptable
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> for an update
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my went up 2k frames xd
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ok
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well then ill just keep using 10.6 if u dont believe me i dont care
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i care
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u on macos right?
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yes
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but i think deen is not
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and he confirmd seeing the same problem
00:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i only remeber he said that when ddnet was build in debug mode
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but u a dev
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ive tried many versions and had similar issues with all
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cant u just compile both and monitor
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that would really help
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> that sounds like work lol
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why not ask deen to do it first ..
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen pls monitor if u have less fps in newer clients than ddnet 10.x.x
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby>

00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that was when ddnet was in debug mode
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> ddnet must have been in debug mode ever since 10.7.1
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> lol
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/529073961212968960/unknown.png
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> exactly, the build system changed the default from Release to Debug and we didn'T notice
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so that problem is now gone
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @onby but u also tested 11.6.1?
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> not yet
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 10.6 is fine
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why should i need to update
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because we only keep developing the most current version
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we don't have the resources for an LTS
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so we should try to fix bugs instead of telling people to use some old version
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> true in general lol
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. messages for being in solo per packet and stuff
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would be nice if ddnet doesnt need downward compability for ever
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @onby ideally you'd bisect it a bit to tell us which release had bad performance first, even better which commit
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby>

00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> my normal 10.6 client
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/529077150133911567/Screen_Shot_2018-12-30_at_5.23.12_PM.png
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> tried playing a lil with 11.6.1
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> look fps is 2x lower+
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> -.-
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> and no its not cus entities
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i turn off entities in 10.6 and my fps goes even higher
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tezcan> wow thats a lot
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [5:22 PM] Jupstar ✪: e.g. messages for being in solo per packet and stuff
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> last time i checked there is no solo parts on fng :thonkery:
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> do u want my settings
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/529077935651684363/Screen_Shot_2018-12-30_at_5.26.45_PM.png
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @onby also the old fps counter was broken
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it showed wrong stuff for me, so i stopped looking into it
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> the fps on 11.6.1 wildly jumps between ~100 and ~250
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if thats more accurate then
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> well its not much better is it?
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ made it more accurate, so you might have had the jumps before but the calculation averaged it out
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> maybe its just a placebo effect from seeing the fps counter going crazy but i doubt it
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> it really did feel laggier last time i tried playing with it
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> rip predition man. 130 so high :(
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i live in usa and my server is in europe lol
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> the antiping actually helps me alot
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the diff is basically that the older clients counted frames
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and the newer uses frame times, and deen was the last who changed that
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it's deffs more accurate
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo | Alex> antiping is awesome. coming back to my question though °!° @deen check private message
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bumm> @-Twist°~
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> antiping is *the* reason i use ddnet client
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Ha, so comparing 10.6.1 with current version I see that 10.6 shows higher fps in counter but the fps graph looks exactly the same
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/529079730230525952/Untitled.png
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So patch in the new fps counter into the old version and see if it drops the same way @onby
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont compile my own client
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i have another testing copy of ddnet that i did compile, i dont ever use it to play but i can try the fps thing later i guess
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sinisa3games> was that a mod promoting scuicide
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Hey ! Just found out that https://ddnet.tw/explain/ doesn't show telegun
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> go to forum then
