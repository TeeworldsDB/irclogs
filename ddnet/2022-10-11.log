00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Teesharp will support only server afaik
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Didnt see a single draft of client
04:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Just thought of another feature to do:
04:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> What if for when you're in the editor, there is an option to show the hexadecimal value for a tile instead of a range of 0 to 255? 
04:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> I feel like there would be some benefits for writing automappers, without having to remember specific numbers, especially in Rules++. It's easier to write a grid of X and Y values than remembering what specific numbers are what.
04:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1029216679072387163/unknown.png
04:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Just want some feedback for if this would be useless or not.
05:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @louis you're a mapper, what's your opinion on this
05:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Voxel i dont write automappers but seems relatively qol
05:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> altho idk if it improves to much of an extent
05:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idk i jsut think its help when you're looking at this all day
05:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1029236749672652841/unknown.png
05:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> the main qol issues i got w editor is i wish hex codes were #FFFFFFFF so it includes alpha
05:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> solution: dont look at that
05:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> but i neeeed to so that know which tiles work
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> but i neeeed to so that i know which tiles work
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also i wish right clicking middle green of a quad gave like a "select all corners"
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wat even is that
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ooh yeah thatd be useful
05:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> pulsar's automapper coding language
05:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> isnt that separate grom ddnet
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> but it helps so much
05:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idk its in its early stages but the way its set up you could instantly create a rules file for a ddnet walls type tileset
05:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh
05:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ic
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ups
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i swear git is trolling me today
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyone want to port sv_vanilla_antispoof to all the modifications we run?
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I might look at it but no promises
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What do we run?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1029351456882577479/screenshot-20221011131459.png
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> -Block
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do we have sources for all?
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> my skin "MummyBear" is missing again in the newest nightly client
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> do you? i saw only zcatch on github, just wanted to ask about other mods
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should, we don't host private sources usually, but I'm not completely sure where we keep them
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> blockZ / infectionZ is private & on my GitHub, I think deen has access to it. It's not affected by spoofing tho
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> doesn't 0.6.5 versions have it already ?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Most mods are based on 0.6.4
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do we host closed-source mods?
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/858472720835936266/934072799532826624/cybSmoker.gif
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does this mean? ^^
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> True, why
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Remove them
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think this is a very opinionated commit
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you think tig blame is worse than git blame?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> No but setting it on git makes it work for e.g vscode git lens
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Which sources the file from git config itself
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, vscode doesn't have a good way to go back commits?
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, vscode blame doesn't have a good way to go back commits?
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Git lens plugin must know about formatting revs file
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 just list tig as an option but dont put the blame rev as a "last resort"
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see that it's also very useful for other software. the first commit sounded like it recommended `git blame`
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I think that `git blame` is a very bad UI
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so I wanted to steer people away from it
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I never used git blame itself myself xd
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see? but I think your commit only referred to `git blame`
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> your additional commentary made it sound reasonable, you could add it. and add that gitrevisions can make the output of the tools more useful
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ut refered to setting the config
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Can you add it pls, i cant do it rn
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Better Git Blame
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > ----------------
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Set a git ignore revs file to ignore formatting revisions:
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this sounded to me like recommending git blame
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because it's in the heading
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wanted to steer people away from it
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's more like a "better vscode git lens" that you wanted, I think
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it also fits in that heading now
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Doesnt tig use that too
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably, but I wouldn't want to hide revisions from my `tig blame`
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> extra revisions aren't bad in `tig blame`, just press comma one more time if you want to skip them
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> blockZ was taken over by DDNet and initially created by coffee.
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And blockZ should stay on DDNet.
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> meh, I don't like closed-source mods
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We could ask coffee if we can open source it
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where can I find coffee?
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> coffee shop:greenthing:
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > a place where cannabis products are sold and consumed
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> even better
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think outside of the netherlands coffeeshop and cafe are used interchangeably:D
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1029410756782981201/unknown.png
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Remove blockz if its closed source
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ddnet has values
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks the 4090 on a ITX motherboard
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> You plug the mobo to the gpu xdd
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> This thing will cost me half of my electricity bill
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> pc cases now need to have place for holding gpu, not motherboard
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> :saddo:
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lmao xDD
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u have some crazy electricity bills bro xD
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can ask him, I have worked with him on the mod. Currently I am responsible for it. Ported it to newer DDNet version and added some features, so did he
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 somehow i left gentoo compiling and it went to sleep and it wouldnt wake up
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess it is i3block or smth
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> had to restart -.-
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you try popping to a tty? maybe an X or video driver issue
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my keyboard was in the typical idle state
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with the rgb wave
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i pressed and it didnt answer
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill remove  x11-misc/i3lock
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont even need to lock my screen anyway
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Display_Power_Management_Signaling#Disabling_DPMS
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe this

20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no idea, i think he used to be on discord
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i love the new vibration chillout relax feature
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1029470292688519178/vibration.mp4
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> me too LOL
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> So good progress so far! Just wondering now how to deal with conversion, since the tiles values are a char set. How would I convert it to a HEX char set?
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1029512498321309696/unknown.png
