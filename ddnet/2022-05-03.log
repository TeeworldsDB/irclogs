00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I just tested my suggested change, that would break the complete physics... so we probably should leave it as it is
00:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Izanagi> why do i suddenly have 180+ ping on ger2?
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Izanagi> im in the middle of a map and suddenly i have a constant 180 ping
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Izanagi> did i get rerouted in the middle of playing?
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> can /practice in a team with your dummy require only 1 vote instead of 2
00:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> sounds like it
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> no, server doesn't know the difference between another player and dummy
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Izanagi> why?
03:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> have you ever had a computer that shuts down just like there was a power cut?
03:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> my old thinkpad just did that, and it's not the first time
03:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> all kernel logs show nothing, except sometimes the last line before reboot is truncated and filled with null bytes
03:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> time to save my work on usb stick ðŸ™‚
03:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps the hardware powered down because it was overheating
03:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, laptop is cold, and overheating would have a trace in kernel logs
03:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i was just typesetting some latex, nothing fancy
03:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why would overheating turn up in kernel logs?
03:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> isn't that mostly hardware stuff?
03:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i suppose there might be a shortcut because it happend when i layed down my hands on the keyboard quite fast
03:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> nah, it triggers an interrupt first
03:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> when the interrupt is fired, the kernel has like 15ms before going down
03:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oh
03:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> TIL
03:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> at least, it's the case in most embedded cpu i worked on
03:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> temperature cinetic allows this stuff
03:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> this is final message in `/var/log/kern.log`:
03:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```shell

03:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ```
04:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> there's also an interrupt when power goes down
04:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> first there's brown out interrupt
04:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> then there's black out interrupt
04:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> black out interrupt typically state, cpu can execute at x instructions (not guarenteed)
04:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> black out interrupt typically ste, cpu can execute at x instructions (not guarenteed)

09:05 <+ChillerDragon> bra Ac1dBeef stap reconnecting :/
10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> does anyone know if using references within functions has disadvantages? 
10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_references.htm
10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> E.g. if I do something like `vec2 &ViewPos = pGameServer->m_apPlayers[SnappingClient]->m_ViewPos;` so I don't have to write the long expression repeatedly? Is it better to use a reference than a pointer?
10:28 <+ChillerDragon> use a macro :trol:
10:29 <+ChillerDragon> i think jupstar once said that refrences are the better pointers
10:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Could be just fixed by one vote per IP to use practice
10:30 <+ChillerDragon> ddnet/2021-09-15.log:38:12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> reference is bascially same as pointer, just without uglyness and NULL xd

11:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pulsar> if anything you can actually gain (at least on msvc) from using a reference/pointer instead of writing long chains everywhere
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> omagwad im too stopid to write collision code -.- send brain
11:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pulsar> if anything you can actually gain (at least on msvc) from using a reference/pointer instead of writing long chains everywhere, but other than that no difference
11:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pulsar> if anything you can actually gain (at least on msvc) from using a reference/pointer instead of writing long chains everywhere
11:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its better to use the reference
13:36 <+ChillerDragon> this guy
13:37 <+ChillerDragon> I think i need a better irc client or filter out connection messages in weechat -.-
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> /set irc.look.smart_filter on
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> /filter add irc_smart * irc_smart_filter *
13:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```

13:57 <+ChillerDragon> ye i also did that but then i realized i wanna see those messages 
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> but this guy is literally flooding it -.-
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/OpenTube/videos/users/chiller/chichilku3_collision.mp4
13:58 <+ChillerDragon> bad collision code? or awesome walljump feature? :D 
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> Ac1dBeef:!
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> while revising and testing the dragger.cpp I noticed that two different ranges are used in the old code.
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> First the characters nearby are selected here:  <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/14927684eb078615c7eab8841c7043e0d063d6b3/src/game/server/entities/dragger.cpp#L59>
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Here the range g_Config.m_SvDraggerRange is used but in the function FindEntities <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/14927684eb078615c7eab8841c7043e0d063d6b3/src/game/server/gameworld.cpp#L56> the m_ProximityRadius = 28 of a char is added. 
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> And later in the code the tee is droped (so not pulled) because of this line, because the m_ProximityRadius was not added:
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/14927684eb078615c7eab8841c7043e0d063d6b3/src/game/server/entities/dragger.cpp#L138>
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 
14:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Should I also ignore the m_ProximityRadius in the new dragger? I do not think any map would suffer if we would add m_ProximityRadius but it is a physics change
14:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> This basicly increases the range of a dragger by ~half a tee
14:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> This would basically increases the range of a dragger by ~half a tee
14:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> If someone wants to give his opinion on this please tag me or write it on the PR https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5063 so I can read it later....
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Paralix> when i have problem with lag, someone let me download 16.0-rc1 beta with vulkan, but now i don't receive new update, what i need to do :d
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> download the latest client
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from the web
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has vulkan too
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and better
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://ddnet.tw/
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> one thing i noticed is lot of ppl force push on pull requests, but specially on large prs this makes revieweing harder
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because you don't have a diff from your last review
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u gotta check all over again
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho i would rebase when its finally reviewed into a clean commit
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD do you mean me?
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd in general
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but in this case i said this cuz i noticed heinrich
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> force pushed the master server pr
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think he published it as draft just that we can have a sneek preview... Was not ready for review
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok xd
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> A question about prediction.
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Other players hooks are predicted?
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> What if  a tee near you is hooking another tee out of camera?
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Is prediction broken?
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Or is hook predicted with destination point too?
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <trml> the prediction needs the hooked character, so if the hooked character is network clipped the hook won't get predicted
