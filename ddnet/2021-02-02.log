00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga thanks, added the redirect heinrich suggested
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> nice :)
01:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki did we ever add your weapons in freeze patch with a config option?
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is it possible to mod a server so when a player is in a specific location on a map they connect to another port on the same ip (so like i could have a hub world with portals leading to diff modes) and if so, how would i start
03:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why would you need a new connection for that?
03:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yeah that sounds possible, in fng 0.6 i implemented multi servers in a single instance for the tournament mod
07:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
07:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> does anyone know how to do it
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean u could look in the source code but to sum it up:
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> get away from global config and load a local config for ever gamecontext you load
08:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then inside the configs define the mods,like sv_gamemode fng in one, sv_gamemode ctf in another
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> implement these mods
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> alter the server code so that all gamecontexts are updated
08:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <🖤Smetanolub💎> whhat cl_dummy_control does?
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> What freeze patch?
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ahthe pr wasnt added
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> mute
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/806066599345258536/unknown.png
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> oh  sound volume it's enough for mate!:saddo:
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> don't care
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @hussainx3 there already is "Use sounds"
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> yeah i was think i need change all sounds:brownbear:
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Is there any command to ban clients?
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sv_banned_versions takes a comma-separated-string
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Here are the ones banned on official DDNet servers: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/common.cfg#L65
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Thanks :D
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <💖Пулю В Глаз Не Хочешь💖> i just dont know why i write here XD
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> when used with copy moves, dummy will only copy +left and +right inputs
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> not sure if there are more uses to that
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cl_dummy_control allows to use the dummy control commands, i dont know them exactly right now but there should be something like +dummy_jump OR cl_dummy_jump, not sure
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> same for hooking
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does anyone know if theres a way to stop ddnet client from "preventing sleep"? ( @Learath2 ?)
14:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/806154411365629962/Screen_Shot_2021-02-02_at_7.29.11_AM.png
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pepe> Yeah @noby , stop using Mac :kek:
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @noby um it's normal that it prevents sleep, it's a game, not sure how you'd stop that
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think anything that uses the gpu prevents sleep
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> hmmm ok
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ronan> doesnt ddnet utilize the gpu?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 maybe sdl2 does something like that
18:10 <+ChillerDragon> what i really  like about coding is that you can code math without understanding it just by try and error :D
18:10 <+ChillerDragon> if - doesnt work try + if * doesnt work try / and so on
18:10 <+ChillerDragon> quality wisdom ikr
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> C UB entered the conversation
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> :D
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now that ubuntu plans to enable lto, we could also try to enable it? ^^
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no idea how well it works with mingw
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i play with LTO since few years and the only issues i found, i also fixed
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (which all were bugs in our code)
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> example?
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for bugs? or for LTO?
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bugs
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> #3031
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3031
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> #2753
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2753
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> #3205
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3205
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> atleast u could say, all were only visible by more aggressive optimizations
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't exactly understand how the TextEx thing works. thanks for the examples 🙂
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really regret coding that str next token
21:25 <+ChillerDragon> why
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It has such an odd interface
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at least it has tests 🙂
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've come to appreciate testing we should do more
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 🙂
21:27 <+ChillerDragon> ye tests are nice
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> E2E testing is much better but unit testing whatever we can is also good
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyone up for the task could create a fake client that connects to the server and changes the map once
21:28 <+ChillerDragon> what is e2e ? like integration or full tests
21:28 <+ChillerDragon> i did headless client fuzzing in ddnet++ ci
21:28 <+ChillerDragon> used em to connect to the server and test it and then auth as admin and do a shutdown
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> End to end, so we'd launch an actual client and a server and do things to test behaviour
21:29 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/DDNetPP/DDNetPP/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml#L57-L66
21:29 <+ChillerDragon> yea
21:29 <+ChillerDragon> as i expected
21:29 <+ChillerDragon> never heard that term
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could even test physics actually to keep track of regressions
21:30 <+ChillerDragon> launching SDL clients in github ci is kinda tricky i think
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> once we have a teehistorian replayer, that becomes easy 😉
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would make it soo much easier to do physics cleanups without breaking behaviour
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and we could test on real-world player data 😉
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> We should make a headless client for automated testing with the sv
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At the very least join server, change map, chat a couple lines
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> We could even assert positions to know physics didnt change
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Or smth
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Dont need a client for that a fake tee on the server is enough
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hm i guess
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> where are collision lines drawn (for self and others) as i want to make them always appear instead of the work around with a hotkey you have to do with uself and the unreliable setting for others
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cl_show_hook_coll_own 2; cl_show_hook_coll_other 2
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> oh i thought it was 0 or 1
23:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> doesnt work
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> works for me
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SollyBunny> i found the thing anyway in src so its fine ;D
