01:38 < Learath2> deen: what do we do about the autoupdater if we put ddnet on a package manager?
01:39 <@deen> Learath2: disable
01:39 <@deen> either by config or ifdef remove it entirely
01:40 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #734: Fix crashbug in bind system (master...pr_ddnet_crashbug_binds) https://git.io/vSywd
01:41 < Learath2> deen: should probably revert mine and merge heinrich5991's that looks like a more appropriate place to fix it
01:42 <@heinrich5991> oh, didn't see it fixed
01:42 < Learath2> im not sure, should we keep the behaviour of Get intact or not?
01:43 <@heinrich5991> well, that commit didn't fix everything anyway
01:43 < Learath2> i fixed it at GetKey() you fixed it at Get()
01:44 < Learath2> yeah probably not
01:44 <@heinrich5991> even in that file, a lot of code looks like Get()[0]
01:44 < Learath2> better keep Get intact
01:45 <@heinrich5991> in Bind(), in case of an unbind, it misses setting the pointer to 0
01:47 < Learath2> heinrich5991: well wanna fix it in that PR? so we can revert mine and apply yours
01:47 <@heinrich5991> k
01:49 < Learath2> heinrich5991: btw what happened to appveyor?

02:43 < Learath2> heinrich5991: cmake doesn't work with our release tarballs, src/game/generated does not exist
02:44 < Learath2> should it exist or should we create it in cmake?
02:51 < Learath2> oh already fixed on master

10:22 <@deen> the hearts in the beginning of chat take so much space
10:22 <@deen> annoying that the chat is now shorter
10:22 <@deen> i don't use the friends feature anyway

10:34 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 9e7eb9c def: Remove /uninvite
12:58 < necropotame> That's why I've made a suggestion about putting an icon of heart between the border of the screen and the beginning of the text
13:05 <@heinrich5991> maybe it could just not take space by default, and only take space when it actually appears?
13:44 < toast> heinrich5991: that's how I had it at the beginning but then you get the misaligned messages
13:44 <@heinrich5991> what do you mean, misaligned?
13:44 <@heinrich5991> they're not aligned by names anyway, right?
13:45 < toast> atleast the names are left aligned currently
13:45 < toast> i could get rid of the space between the name and the heart
13:46 <@heinrich5991> yea, the names wouldn't be left-aligned
13:54 < toast> all of the messages can be moved left too, it can obv be adjusted
14:26 <@deen> yeah, just move everything left so that the hearts are out of screen :D
14:41 < SP|Someone> wasnt expecting /times to be fixed so fast
14:41 < SP|Someone> i wanted to spam it today aswell :(
14:42 < SP|Someone> pls turn it back on @deen
18:45 < Learath2> vali :/
18:46 < Ryozuki> ddos?
18:47 < Ryozuki> fck off, we were having a fun time :(
18:50 < Learath2> i can't possibly know whether its ddos
18:51 < Learath2> sure felt like one
18:51 < Learath2> i don't even get why anyone would give vali a botnet :/
18:52 < Ryozuki> there is also meskalin
18:52 < Ryozuki> i thik
18:54 < Henningstone> not really
18:54 < Learath2> didn't see meskalin in a long time tho
18:54 < Learath2> not like botnets are cheap either
18:55 < Ryozuki> maybe he infected users by himself
18:55 < Learath2> no way he can keep a botnet of this size going for this long
22:30 < Shishigami> did the forum get updated?
22:31 <@deen> Shishigami: why?
22:31 < Shishigami> top bar looks wrong and there is no red indicator for new posts anymore
22:32 < Shishigami> nevermind, im stupid, my cookie expired
22:32  * Henningstone wants a cookie too :3
22:33 < Shishigami> *hogs all the cookies*
22:34 <@deen> but thanks for reminding me to update the board^^
22:34 < Shishigami> x)
22:36 < Ryozuki> forum doesnt work
22:36 < Ryozuki> xD
22:36 < Ryozuki> Please delete, move or rename the install directory before you use your board. If this directory is still present, only the Administration Control Panel (ACP) will be accessible.
