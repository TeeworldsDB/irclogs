01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xDDD
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> xD
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wtf
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> opengl3 good
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> my Client never crash
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the fix for the crash is out since 2 weeks or something
02:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and if it crashes at startup its probably bcs system not threadsafe

19:58 < laxa> Any way to compile ddnet server in 32 bits from a 64 bits arch ?
19:58 < laxa> seems like cmake is just ignoring CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS
20:02 < laxa> ah, I think I found a way
20:05 <@heinrich5991> laxa: set CXXFLAGS before you run cmake for the first time
20:05 <@heinrich5991> also, try to make use of build directories, if you do, you can have multiple configs at the same time
20:05 < laxa> I just compiled everything but linking failed
20:05 <@heinrich5991> `CFLAGS=-m32 CXXFLAGS=-m32 LDFLAGS=-m32 cmake ..`?
20:05 <@heinrich5991> or something like that
20:07 < laxa> dang, 3 files compiled with 64 bits
20:15 < laxa> ok compiled successfully, 3 files are compiled with gcc and I added only CXX flags
20:17 < laxa> For the record, I am learning/experimenting fuzzing on ddnet with afl
20:17 < laxa> Will try ASAN, but it is advised to use 32 bits when doing so
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> What happened
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> Why all in this server rotated to 180â€¢
20:49 <@deen> @Arseniy Zarche Try turning around your screen, maybe someone turned it around as April's fool
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> Good joke

20:55 <@deen> looks normal to me
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> Forgot
20:55 <@deen> except for the russian
20:55 <@deen> can't read that
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> What can't read?
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> Turned letters?
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> the russian letters
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> "ÐŸÐ°Ñ€Ð°Ð¼ÐµÑ‚Ñ€Ñ‹ ÐºÐ°Ð½Ð°Ð»Ð°" is "Settings of the channel"
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> In description you don't turned letters ðŸ˜¦
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Xusep> have u tried updating ur graphics card drivers
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <sorgaxD> ddnet chile is down please fix :'v
