10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NANAMAR> @Trafalgar Law same
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> does it work when you download new 14.0.3 from ddnet.tw?
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NANAMAR> nope
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NANAMAR> same
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but 14.0.2 worked?
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I can't reproduce this, again...
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NANAMAR> i guess so
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> 14.0.2 worked for me
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Do I have to download now 14.0.2 from ddnet.tw?
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nooooo, the weird linking issue again
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> how did we solve it before @Learath2 ? I guess I have to rebuild SDL2.dll myself?
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, looks like i fixed it by self-compiling
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the issue was the mismatch of how gcc and msvs builds the dlls import address table
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> Imagine the tons of work deen doing on DDNet even as retired admin :justatest:
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No worries, I'll be on vacation soon üòÑ
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> No :(
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Trafalgar Law @NANAMAR can you please verify if https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-14.0.3-win64.zip works before I release it again?
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I try sec
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Works üëå
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NANAMAR> > @Trafalgar Law @NANAMAR can you please verify if https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-14.0.3-win64.zip works before I release it again?
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NANAMAR> @deen  im not at home now
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> -1 means "no version packet received" @Learath2
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 does vanilla send a version packet to become 0?
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So vanilla is now -1?
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but not to the code
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only in status
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> didn't want to break the code
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was just about to say the code still refers to `VERSION_VANILLA` and that's 0
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://nimbleindustries.io/2020/06/04/has-github-been-down-more-since-its-acquisition-by-microsoft/
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut you might want to take a look at your fastdownload
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/727115912121155704/Screenshot_2020-06-29_at_13.58.38.png
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> `sv_map_download_speed` seems to be too high. What value are you using @fokkonaut ?
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Happened to me aswell some days ago. One hour later everything was fine again. The connection quality of the server seems to fluctuate a bit.
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 i dont have fast download for ddnet clients
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's beyond slow
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is that, extra slow download for ddnet clients?
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I don't know how to fix the 0.7 votes
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The message `CNetMsg_Sv_VoteSet`¬†needs translation, it can't happen in `CGameContext::SendVoteSet` as at that point idk who it's sent to if `ClientID == -1`, it can't happen in `CServer::SendPackMsgTranslate` as there I don't have enough information to fill the 0.7 packet
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 what's wrong with the votes?
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.7 can call them but cant see them
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why don't you know who it's sent to? Shouldn't they go to everyone?
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> right now the connection to fokkonauts server seems stable. 20 KiB/s in 0.6, about 500 in 0.7
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well `CServer::SendPackMsg`¬†is usually what handles the -1 case
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess I could move that up and handle the -1 in `SendVoteSet`
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, sounds ok
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think you had to do that once before
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen some localization update got into the https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2398
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 that was actually intentional
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because I added a new setting in menu, then wanted to translate it, then noticed some problems with translation stuff üòÑ
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen the zoom client-to-server info thing is already in the 14.0.3 version?
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> heinrich still has some good ideas for how to improve it
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Just noticed there's something weird with it even now
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> like
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/727140595574898728/unknown.png
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> on the red X on right is player, which I can't see, even though there's still 2 tiles until edge, yet freeze-particles are showing
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 1920x1080 with default zoom set to 7
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that's expected I think
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Is there are a public gCTF repo?
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/Teetime/teeworlds/tree/tw-plus with sv_gametype gctf
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Thanks üôè
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 normal map download for ddnet
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> big map
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen we should add fokkonauts map to maps.ddnet.tw, no one should have to wait 25 minutes for a map
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <·∂∞¬∞KonÕßsti> @fokkonaut make ur map smaller
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 usually it is just about 1-2 minutes? weird. Maybe because many players are online and therefore it takes longer
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 that maps has updates sometimes, no need to add it i guess
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/727150928385278062/unknown.png
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> :/
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> it downloads fastere than any city map >2000
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> it downloads faster than any city map >2000
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's 0.7 though
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> yep
16:13 < ChillerDragon_> yo does someone have expierience with broken harddrives? Idk what happend I was afk 5 min when I came back my laptop was stuck in reboot console. And after I force restarted the drive was no longer detected :/
16:14 <+ChillerDragon_> I can only boot into my bios ._. and I also tried a live usb which booted but it did not find a drive
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> sata dead
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try plugging the hdd out and in again
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my laptop survived another 2 years and still counting on that method
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> spinning rust hard disk or ssd?
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for spinning rust it depends on how it is broken. If it makes weird sounds it's hard to repair. If the logic board has some burn marks, I once switched it out with another one (of the exact same model) and could restore the data
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> past the logic board, it get's very hard to repair at home
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you'd need a clean room or atleast one of those filtered boxes to actually open it up and check the platters/head
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> exactly, you'll have to open it up and if some dust gets inside good night
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what I heard as a hack is to work upside down
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> in a very calm room, so that no dust gets blown up
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good night
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was once considering getting one of those filtered boxes and becoming a hdd repair specialist
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it's always an option after I fail uni
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 why focus on hdd, just become a pc repair man
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u basically scam everyone
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hdd people get paid well, and I can feel a little good about myself
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly, not sure if I could live with being a pc repairman
