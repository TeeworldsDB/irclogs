08:40 < hannibal> good morning
08:47 < ochristi> why would someone make a fake ddnet server and call it that
10:31 < laxadedi> good morning
10:32 < pause> mornin'
10:37 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
10:37 < laxadedi> pause: maybe I could go eat with you today, but not sure yet
10:37 < laxadedi> school is fucking full, no place to eat :p
10:55 < pause> laxadedi: Lol =D
10:55 < pause> laxadedi: I've got food already, not much time to eat
10:56 < pause> laxadedi: Must train instrument =)
10:56 < laxadedi> hum, well guess I wont come
10:58 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
10:59 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
11:08 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
11:09 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
11:11 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
11:33 < hannibal> wait.. you guys live next door?
11:35 < pause> hannibal: Nope, but we both work in paris
11:36 < hannibal> aw k, i thought you were internet strangers, just like me.
11:39 < pause> hannibal: Nah we know each other for some time now
11:39 < pause> Like, 6 years xD
11:39 < pause> Even 7 i think
11:40 < hannibal> okay :) and you started to play teeworlds together=
11:41 < pause> Lol, i'm not even playing teeworlds
11:41 < pause> Well, i did, like 2 years ago maybe
11:41 < hannibal> oh
11:41 < hannibal> lol
11:42 < hannibal> that's sad! it's a great game.
11:43 < pause> Well, not much time to play, and i sucked anyway =P
11:43 < pause> Spent my time falling in the wrong place
11:43 < pause> Pissed off laxa XD
11:44 < hannibal> it takes a lot of time
11:44 < hannibal> that's true 
11:44 < hannibal> don't know where i take it from
11:44 < hannibal> i guess other parts of my life suffer..
11:44 < pause> hannibal: Like, going outside your house ? XD
11:44 < hannibal> :D 
11:44 < hannibal> like that, yes
11:45 < hannibal> or eating
11:45 < hannibal> :D
11:47 < pause> xD
11:49 < laxadedi> pause: not that much time, only 5 years, well 6 now !
11:50 < laxadedi> Great story : I am suppose to install xwiki for a school project, but all their download links are dead... Please help me :(
12:28 <@deen> Does anyone know about this: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/63
12:46 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/63
12:47 <@deen> maybe we should split the quad into triangles to get the same behaviour everywhere
12:50 < BeaR> hey (:
12:51 < hannibal> hi :
12:54 < pause> laxadedi: Use something else !
12:57 <@deen> BeaR: you probably know about this: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues/63
12:57 < BeaR> well yeah vendor specific
13:02 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went down!
13:07 < BeaR> deen: what map is it? Would like to check if they changed it on newer drivers (:
13:07 <@deen> i don't even know^^
13:08 <@deen> got the screenshot sent from soneone
13:08 < Nimda> DDNet Persian went back online!
13:08 <@deen> but it happens with every quad
13:09 < BeaR> Have the first one also (if he hasn't rotated it)
13:11 <@deen> it's not a ddnet map
13:11 <@deen> HDP_Filosoflow1.2
13:14 < BeaR> deen: not worth fixing imho as the latest drivers seem to triangulate it all the same way
13:19 <@deen> ok, nice
13:20 <@deen> well, except that for my gpus there are no new drivers
13:22 < BeaR> gonna do some quick benchmark if there is a performance hit
13:23 <@deen> shouldn't be since the driver triangulates it as well, right?
13:24 < BeaR> probably but not sure
13:29 < BeaR> surprisingly rendering via triangle fans has the same rendering time lol
14:00 <@deen> =)
14:03 <@deen> hm, king and bor aren't here
14:04 <@deen> I have a new offer for a non-lagging iranian server
14:18 < EastByte> cool
14:21 <@deen> hm, we'll wait to see how the new iranian server by king is first
14:21 < EastByte> or we set up both and check which get more players
14:35 < pause> Since there is so much german people in here, i feel compelled to link related stuff =P

14:35 < hannibal> can't go wrong with bach.
14:35 < hannibal> the master.
14:36 < pause> Exactly !
14:36 < hannibal> oh i want to show you something
14:38 < hannibal> this is the youtube channel of "smalin", a pianist. he creates visualizations to classical music pieces. it adds a whole new dimension to the music i think.. or at least it reeeeally helps you to udnerstand the complexity of a piece.

14:41 < pause> hannibal: I'm checking this out as soon as i finish current piece (Matth√§us-Passion)
14:41 < pause> Too bad i don't understand german though =/
14:41 < hannibal> oh, you don't need to speak any language to see :)
14:42 < pause> I meant for st matthew passion
14:42 < pause> Lots of german in there =P
14:42 < hannibal> oh! :D
14:44 < hannibal> i don't even know it, i admit.
14:46 < pause> hannibal: Well, it's Bach so you know what to expect
14:46 < pause> If you understand german it must be even better, since you can follow the story !

14:47 < pause> WTF ?
14:47 < hannibal> i'm just reading.. the text is based on chapter 26 / 27 of luthers translation of the new testament.
14:48 < hannibal> well no. chapter 26 of the "gospel of matthew" which is one of 4 parts of the new testament.
14:48 < hannibal> lol :D
14:48 < hannibal> okay, i'm listening.
14:50 < pause> My christianity level isn't far from zero i fear =P
14:51 < hannibal> same. though the history is interesting, of course, because it is such an important part of the past 2000 years. :)
15:45 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] cinaera opened pull request #64: Render quads as triangle fans (DDRace64...pr_triangle) http://git.io/JsOeIg
15:47 < BeaR> deen: probably needs some testing on other gpu's, as this should actually increase the driver overhead but not sure if GL_QUADS is slowpath on my driver :d
15:47 < hannibal> pause: love part from min 31 onwards
15:48 < hannibal> especially how the flute comes in :)
15:54 < pause> hannibal: Yup. The chorus and soloists are really great too
15:55 < hannibal> did you check out smalin?
15:56 < pause> hannibal: Yup, love the visualizations
15:56 < pause> But it seems to be played too fast oO
15:57 < hannibal> hm, my example wasn't the best, (it's also in white, not typical for his work), but i just love the short violin piece :D
15:58 < hannibal> try this one (one of my favorite movements of... ever :D) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPF2GogbHkU

16:50 < EastByte> deen: are you there?
16:52 < hannibal> bb.. i'm off for today :)
17:37 < Nimda> DDNet GER went down!
17:37 <@deen> shit
17:37 <@deen> hi EastByte 
18:02 < EastByte> deen: do you want to ping 92.222.217.24 and 37.187.210.137 and tell me the difference?
18:02 <@deen> from home?
18:03 < EastByte> yea
18:03 <@deen> rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 22.775/23.209/24.334/0.359 ms
18:03 <@deen> rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 22.881/23.443/24.391/0.374 ms
18:04 < EastByte> so you have a difference of ~0.02
18:04 < EastByte> for me 37.187.210.137 is 1 ms faster
18:06 < EastByte> 92.222.217.24 is located in strasbourg
18:06 < EastByte> and 37.187.210.137 directed to the same server but localised in ger
18:09 < EastByte> deen: I think you should have tested one of those instead of kimsufi: http://www.ovh.de/virtual_server/vps-cloud.xml
18:09 < EastByte> for it the cheapest one seems to be stable like a dedicated server
18:10 < EastByte> but you can chose the location, add additional ips and anti-ddos pro
18:10 <@deen> oh
18:10 <@deen> didn't even see them, i think i ignore everything containing the word "cloud"
18:11 < EastByte> yea maybe, someone tested tha vps classic ones (openvz)
18:11 < EastByte> which really are oversold
18:11 <@deen> yes, they are way too laggy
18:11 < EastByte> you can follow me in tw if you wanna test
18:14 < EastByte> deen: I'm still not sure whether it's my fault having anti-ddos pro without professional server
18:23 < laxa> Anyone know how to configure SMTP on postfix with one user ? :p
18:40 < Nimda> DDNet GER went back online!
18:54 < Learath2> laxa: postfix without any specific configuration should work for system users
18:54 < laxa> it doesn't
18:54 < laxa> and anyway, I would like to use a different password than the system one
18:55 < laxa> since I want this to be able to send mail with this address laxa@ddracepro.net on gmail
18:55 < laxa> and gmail need to use my SMTP server
18:58 < Learath2> well laxa if you want Authed SMTP you need somekind of SASL which is either Cyrus or Dovecot for postfix
18:59 < laxa> gmail wants authed SMTP, I don't have a choice I think
18:59 < laxa> SASL is secure right ?
19:00 < Learath2> yep
19:00 < Learath2> I only used Dovecot before tho
19:00 < laxa> http://xmodulo.com/enable-user-authentication-postfix-smtp-server-sasl.html
19:01 < laxa> but it doesn't tell how to make an account <_<
19:04 < pause> fg
19:05 < Learath2> laxa depents on the file you include at the bottom of 10-auth.conf
19:05 < laxa> pause: xD
19:05 < pause> whoops, did it again
19:05 < laxa> Learath2: with dovecot right ?
19:05 < Learath2> yep
19:06 < Learath2> there are many database types
19:06 < Learath2> laxa: http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Authentication I'd read this explains it nicelt

19:38 <@deen> EastByte: sounds like we need accounts!: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=527&p=4474#p4474
19:39 < EastByte> yea :)
19:39 < EastByte> still working on the datagram channel
19:39 < EastByte> I want to make it usable for normal request/response cmds and long data transfer
19:50 < BeaR> you really play to add one ?:
19:51 < EastByte> it's worth a test
19:52 <@deen> i would have so much less work identifying and kicking fakers
19:52 < BeaR> for ddnet users only?
19:53 <@deen> yes
20:00 <@heinrich5991> deen: not sure if it will cut down fakers
20:00 <@deen> at least they will be more easily recognizable as fakers
20:02 < EastByte> also then it's not important to care about fakers anymore
20:02 < EastByte> logged in players know whether a player really is his friend or not
20:02 < EastByte> their*
20:03 <@heinrich5991> except maybe for similarily named people
20:03 <@deen> hm, yes, l and I would still be annoying
20:05 < BeaR> btw I fixed the parallax stuff for sound layers (:
20:06 < EastByte> deen: imagine you could access all ddnet maps directly over client and commit changes (as a mapper)
20:06 <@deen> EastByte: nonono!
20:06 < EastByte> yesyesyes!
20:06 <@deen> maps shouldn't be changed at all
20:07 < EastByte> well, changes before the map is released :)
20:07 <@deen> it's not on ddnet until it is released, only on test servers
20:08 < eeeee> do you have some kind of version control for maps?
20:08 <@deen> http://github.com/def-/ddnet-maps
20:08 <@heinrich5991> i.e. no
20:08 <@heinrich5991> :P
20:08 < eeeee> raw :/
20:08 < EastByte> deen didn't like the idea
20:09 <@heinrich5991> BeaR: have you considered adding a volume cap in the client?
20:09 < eeeee> e.g. you could serialize them to nicely formatted json somehow and sort of see the exact changes
20:09 < EastByte> should be easy to make a diff/patch system for tw maps
20:09 <@heinrich5991> not sure if it's easy
20:09 < EastByte> json is too expensive for that much data
20:10 < eeeee> how much is that?
20:10 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: gzipped it was similar to the binary map file
20:10 < EastByte> my webgl map viewer worked with json before
20:10 <@heinrich5991> so I suppose it could work
20:10 < EastByte> the files were some mb big
20:11 < EastByte> heinrich5991: so you want to decompress and parse the json in livetime?
20:11 <@heinrich5991> no
20:11 <@heinrich5991> for diffing
20:11 < EastByte> ah
20:11 < EastByte> hmkay
20:11 <@heinrich5991> (and not me, eeeee)
20:12 < eeeee> could have an actual git repo of json maps and make pull requests and shit
20:12 <@deen> i think mappers wouldn't like that
20:12 < eeeee> ofc with some kind of automated map build bot
20:13 < eeeee> yeah i suspect that as well :D
20:13 < eeeee> but would be nifty to have
20:13 < EastByte> if the client is able to upload/manage maps automatically I guess they would like it
20:14 < EastByte> I mean, downloading map into map folder, start client, select map, change map, save map, open map folder, upload via webbrowser
20:14 < EastByte> is quite annoying
20:15 <@deen> ideal process in my opinion would be this:
20:15 < eeeee> EastByte: you should just make your webgl viewer into a complete editor
20:15 <@deen> Mapper makes his map an has testserver running on localhost
20:15 < eeeee> then we can make collaborative editing (like google docs)
20:15 < EastByte> eeeee: deen didn't like that either
20:15 <@deen> map is automatically reloaded on save
20:16 < EastByte> yea it already works like that
20:16 < BeaR> heinrich5991: You can limit the sound of the ingame samples via a slider, I believe the max volume is capped somewhere in the audio engine afaik
20:16 <@heinrich5991> BeaR: would just be nice to know that maps can't use overly loud sounds
20:17 < eeeee> or we could just start signing the official ddnet maps
20:18 <@deen> you all with your complicated solutions :P
20:18 < eeeee> ;D
20:18 < eeeee> just throwing in ideas until something sticks
20:20 < BeaR> collaborative editing with in-editor play, the dream \o/
20:20 < EastByte> well, wait for patafix
20:20 <+o_be_one> yau
20:21 < eeeee> BeaR: when you save map it reloads in local testserver, right? if we use load/save functionality won't it be the same as in-editor play?
20:21 <@deen> eeeee: right
20:21 < EastByte> nope
20:21 <@deen> (right, it reloads)
20:21 < EastByte> yea, nothing else :P
20:21 < eeeee> umh
20:21 < BeaR> eeeee: basically just saves the map and sends 'reload' to the rcon
20:22 < eeeee> by load/save i mean save the tees' positions (like in timeout protection code) or something
20:22 < eeeee> or maybe it's more similar to pause
20:22 < eeeee> anyway just basically serialize the ccharacter to something and the load it back
20:22 <@deen> yes, that's what save/load does
20:22 < EastByte> I think pata wants to implement something really interactive
20:23 < EastByte> editing while having a player in map
20:23 <@deen> minecraft-like editing?
20:23 < EastByte> maybe
20:23 < EastByte> I wonder how he wants to add quads like this
20:23 < eeeee> impossibru
20:23 < EastByte> switching between player and mouse editing would be cool
20:23 < BeaR> :D
20:24 < BeaR> didn't he want to do collaborative editing ?
20:25 < EastByte> yea
20:25 < EastByte> all in one
20:25 < BeaR> rather rewrite teeworlds :D
20:26 < EastByte> I would rewrite it in html5 if I had enough experience and time :)
20:30 < EastByte> man I have 6 virtual private servers now
20:30 <@deen> hahaha
20:30 < Learath2> wow what are you even doing on all that
20:30 < EastByte> only to find out that the ovh cloud vps is the best vps plan on the market
20:30 < EastByte> just testing
20:31 <@deen> EastByte: but no ddos protection pro?
20:31 < EastByte> I'm not sure
20:32 < EastByte> just buy a classic one for 2.40eur to find out whether anti ddos pro is enabled^^
20:32 <@deen> hm, made another ping test, cloud one seems to jump a bit after all
20:32 < EastByte> I can enable firewall rules / mitigation on all my ovh ips
20:32 <@deen> rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 22.899/24.259/49.276/4.384 ms
20:33 <@deen> compared to GER:
20:33 <@deen> rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 20.016/20.497/26.705/1.091 ms
20:33 < EastByte> hm didn't experience it yet
20:34 < EastByte> well it still is a vps
20:34 <@deen> GER is a vps too!
20:34 < EastByte> c'mon
20:34 <@deen> haha
20:34 < eeeee> i have a vps which costs me $10 a year
20:35 <@deen> eeeee: nice
20:35 < EastByte> my cheapest one is 12eur a year
20:35 < EastByte> oh and I have one for free but dat thing doesn't count
20:36 <+o_be_one> hey deen you added the fast emote feature ive seen :D ?
20:36 <@deen> o_be_one: only on blocker servers i think
20:37 <+o_be_one> no i was on ddnet usa yesterday
20:37 <@deen> ah
20:37 <@deen> broken added it on USA
20:37 <@deen> about a year ago
20:37 <+o_be_one> oh :(
20:37 <@deen> he really needs it or something^^
20:37 < EastByte> sooo important to spam emotes
20:37 <+o_be_one> fast emote is awesome
20:37 < EastByte> ha
20:37 < EastByte> ha
20:37 < EastByte> ha
20:37 < EastByte> ha
20:37 < EastByte> ^
20:37 < EastByte> even quakenet doesnt allow it
20:37 <@deen> he pays for the server and shut down his own instead, so i guess it's fine
20:38 <+o_be_one> if you dont use it you cant understand ...
20:38 <+o_be_one> but when you do a smile and 10s after you get blocket, you want to show an other emote
20:39 <+o_be_one> these lasts days ive just seen some guys binding /emote to bypass the miss of fast emote
20:39 <+o_be_one> so they use theyr key to spam the /emote cmd ... you really think its better :/ ?
20:40 <+o_be_one> some get mutted for 60s on xxlddrace (dont know about ddnet) for that >.<
20:40 <@deen> =)
20:43 < BeaR> deen: you know something else which is missing at my sound branch ?:
