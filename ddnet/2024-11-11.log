01:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless regarding anti cheat there is not much i can do for you as i already said. ddnet++ can load antibot modules but i have none that i can share.
01:23 < bridge> <sollybunny> i know how atleast 1 detection works and it is sorely a borked solution!
01:58 < bridge> <sollybunny> autoclicked when frozen and thats apparently triggerbot so now i know how 2 detections work
03:01 < bridge> <woidless> Your server has been running for more than 2 years, you will naturally begin to understand a lot. But I came less than a month ago, and there's a lot I can't even do. I do not know which file is responsible for what. ChillerDragon and Jupstar are 2 wonderful people who helped me start my server from 0 and set it up , but I kind of like none of them I didn't forcibly ask , each of them helped even with the lightness of my question. But each of them
03:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless asking questions when you are new is totally fine. Sadly the translations code is a bit messy. But if you want to start editing the code let me know I can give you some hints.
03:56 < bridge> <pathos3005> ChillerDragon Veeery nice, I see it, thanks :D
03:56 < bridge> <pathos3005> Ok good to know
05:01 < bridge> <woidless> What do you mean, edit the code? Like learning C++?
05:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea
05:38 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah but wouldnt it be cool

07:01 < bridge> <woidless> I don't think I'll be able to learn C++ yet.
08:08 < bridge> <kollpotato> honestly speaking ddnet source code is pretty straight forward to understand
08:09 < bridge> <kollpotato> i was able to make simple changes without knowing c++ at all
08:42 < bridge> <avolicious> But you are kinda asking in 4 different places about the same thing, because people dont answer immediately. Thats a bit annoying
09:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes you can do a lot in the ddnet source code with little c++ knowledge
09:29 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon make sure that when people hold the flag , 1 exp is given every 0.5 seconds
09:31 < bridge> <woidless> I initially asked in questions, but after I came to the developer, in KoG I asked only 2 times to clarify the mode Gores
09:33 < bridge> <avolicious> You asked in here in 2 different channels, after approval you joined the KoG discord to ask there several times ðŸ˜„
09:34 < bridge> <avolicious> I see, ChillerDragon is booked now ^^ Hopefully you send an invoice chiller ðŸ˜„

13:51 < bridge> <meloÆž> ye guru is user driven right?

13:51 < bridge> <meloÆž> Yee
13:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Submitting_ebuilds
13:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh submitting a ebuild is not that hard, i guess what i read more as hard was being a official maintainer xd
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @woidless iirc i intentionally decided against that since i do not want to spam people with broadcasts just because they managed to get the flag
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> everyone who cares about money/xp will quite quickly find out they need to login. No need to spam casual pro players that managed to yoink the flag from others.
14:11 < bridge> <woidless> Well, how do I make a SlowNET when the whole game is slow-motion, like slow-motion
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can change a few tunes to slow down individual parts thats about it
14:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a full slow mo mode does not exist and i do not plan adding one
14:13 < bridge> <woidless> Well , which tune should be replaced
14:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can start with all the ones that have speed in the name :)
14:14 < bridge> <woidless> Well
14:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory64/blob/main/proposals/memory64/Overview.md
14:22 < bridge> <woidless> ChillerDragon
14:22 < bridge> <woidless> Make sure that the flag cannot be picked up in the team
14:30 < bridge> <woidless> And also so that the number of murders in a row could not increase in tim
14:30 < bridge> <woidless> And also so that the number of murders in a row could not increase in team
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the flags make sense the sprees im not sure
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why do you have teams on in the first place?
14:39 < bridge> <woidless> Because.
14:39 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> So why do you not want to track sprees in teams?
14:40 < bridge> <zhn> chiller i guess you need to share your home number or an address of nearest restaurant to keep this conversation :troll:
14:41 < bridge> <woidless> What? I just want the person on the team not to be able to pick up the flag and also not to be able to raise the kill streak.
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes the flags i understand but why not rais the kill streak?
14:42 < bridge> <woidless> How would you just go for dummy to a team or friend, turn on /team0mode and just hook him, and just reset for dummy or friend. And here is +1 murder
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I see
14:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> farming. But what if i do legit kills in a team then they do not count.
14:44 < bridge> <woidless> Well, then what should I do?
14:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I recommend turning off teams
14:45 < bridge> <woidless> Then if you do this, you need to implement a duel system
14:45 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so you use teams for duels? thats why i asked sounds like in duels you do want to track the spree
14:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes a duel system is planned i was just too lazy to implement one yet
14:46 < bridge> <woidless> A respectable reason.
14:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so yea i always have teams off but maybe deactivating almost all features in teams is the way to go. It just feels a bit weird to me but it might be the sensible thing to do.
14:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> should then probably also disallow farmtiles.
14:51 < bridge> <woidless> Maybe you'll just make it impossible to recruit killstreak into the team?
14:54 < bridge> <woidless> As well as raising the flag.
14:54 < bridge> <woidless> And you will do it as a choice in the config
15:05 < bridge> <upsetimiapset> how to get new account in ddnet???
15:05 < bridge> <upsetimiapset> my account is dead i can even walk

16:51 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Think about your behaviour and form of expression. You did similar things asking me questions. Everyone starts somewhere
16:53 < bridge> <sedonya> I didn't ask you questions of that kind, and I certainly didn't ask you for the most trivial things to do them instead of me, besides I contributed to your repository, very small, but at least I did something unlike the others who host your mod, along with your map
16:54 < bridge> <sedonya> I didn't ask you questions of that kind, and I certainly didn't ask you for the most trivial things to do them instead of me, besides I contributed to your repository, very small, but at least I did something, unlike the others who host your mod, along with your card

16:54 < bridge> <fokkonaut> There's no need to get defensive
16:54 < bridge> <sedonya> ok xd
16:54 < bridge> <sedonya> let's end the dialogue at this point
16:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I didn't intend the things you mentioned, just your message to that guy

18:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> What kind of black magic is this? trashmap offers hot reload on editor save, but I'm not even logged in to rcon and it works
18:22 < bridge> <fokkonaut> the map is updating correctly??!
18:22 < bridge> <learath2> backdoor
18:26 < bridge> <oxyzo.> hack
18:26 < bridge> <kollpotato> well my theory is that the browser has the access to the file and can listen to changes of its content
18:27 < bridge> <learath2> @timakro explain your black magic
18:28 < bridge> <manikoo> voldemort
18:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API ig this is the api used behind the scenes
18:28 < bridge> <learath2> I sort of doubt that for some reason
18:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> well probably just a loop which reads the file and checks if it has changed
18:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> or checks the property lastModified
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> Oh actually it could work, the client sends the hot_reload command so the webpage doesn't need to listen for changes
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> just request the file again, though idk if that is possible ðŸ˜„
18:30 < bridge> <Ewan> hi
18:31 < bridge> <Ewan> not without prompting
18:31 < bridge> <Ewan> (I would hope)
18:31 < bridge> <learath2> that's what I think aswell
18:32 < bridge> <learath2> hm he said not logged into rcon too
18:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> i gotta implement this
18:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> you guys got me curious
18:34 < bridge> <learath2> @fokkonaut are you sure you didn't hallucinate? The `hot_reload` is gated behind `if(Client()->RconAuthed() && g_Config.m_EdAutoMapReload)`
18:35 < bridge> <learath2> Oh why are we even speculating, trashmap is open source
18:35 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/timakro/trashmap
18:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> i wanna do it from scratch
18:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> probably because it doesnt use the client at all to update the map
18:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> it happens through the server
18:36 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah, it actually does observe the file
18:37 < bridge> <learath2> I didn't think that was allowed due to security concerns
18:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> and how would it work anyway, the web cant interact with native apps
18:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> same

18:38 < bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/whatwg/fs/blob/main/proposals/FileSystemObserver.md
18:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> lmao im on this exact page rn
18:38 < bridge> <learath2> You can even watch the file instead of having to poll wow
18:39 < bridge> <learath2> My web knowledge is so 2010 :pepeW:
18:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> i follow the hype train
18:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> im all up to date
18:40 < bridge> <learath2> To be fair actually I am fairly up to date on css, just not js
18:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> why
18:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> is css used somewhere except the web?
18:41 < bridge> <learath2> There is this dude that keeps showing up in my youtube recommended, so I hear about all the new css stuff early on
18:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> kevin powell?
18:41 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, that one
18:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> bruh i havent watched him in a year
18:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> but i remember his name
18:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> he is the css legend
18:42 < bridge> <learath2> He seems to have hacked the youtube algorithm. I don't even web much, but he kept popping up
18:43 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Very sure, yes
18:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> just tried it again, works reliably
18:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> wtf
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah we figured it out, it's web worker html 7 web 4 blackmagic that allows you to listen to changes to a file
18:44 < bridge> <fokkonaut> aahh
18:44 < bridge> <kollpotato> very safe and reliable
18:44 < bridge> <learath2> So the webpage just keeps listening for changes on that file and does the hot reload through there instead of the client
18:45 < bridge> <kollpotato> dont paste your passwords in that file by accident and you are good
18:45 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i see
18:45 < bridge> <learath2> I'm actually curious about the safety of it with regards to how it handles the file being changed under it
18:46 < bridge> <learath2> I guess as long as that specific path never contains anything sensitive you are always fine(tm)
18:47 < bridge> <kollpotato> im not sure if its still a thing but the browser can make requests to your local http servers
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> something something cors something something
18:48 < bridge> <learath2> I wonder what the defaults are if you don't set a cors policy
18:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> yes but how often do you setup cors on your local server
18:49 < bridge> <learath2> Which is why I wonder what the defaults are ðŸ˜„
18:49 < bridge> <meloÆž> I thought you're mocking him until I realised you wrote cors.. not koll

22:37 < bridge> <meloÆž> :kek:  as bencie mentioned once - we don't recommend the demotion from purple to blue, we all know blue gear is shit :gigachad: :thisemoji:
22:43 < bridge> <Ewan> yea.. i guess it all worked out
22:45 < bridge> <Ewan> man direnv + the vscode extension takes out so much nix guesswork
22:45 < bridge> <Ewan> efficient
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone used sccache? iâ€™m thinking of setting up distributed builds across my home network so i dont have to wait on just the measly m3 pro
22:48 < bridge> <Ewan> joking about the measly part but yknow
23:10 < bridge> <meloÆž> direnv is godsent, combined with devenv which is just one huge option package and the setup is a breeze all the way through
23:10 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
23:10 < bridge> <meloÆž> "Laughs in `languages.rust.enable = true:`"
23:10 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
23:13 < bridge> <Ewan> do u have an example project with a flake for all this
23:13 < bridge> <Ewan> the devenv thing
23:13 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds easy in concept
23:16 < bridge> <meloÆž> Just try it in a nix shell, the init file has some starting points and links to it, you can also use devenv as a flake input
23:16 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
23:16 < bridge> <meloÆž> `devenv init`
23:16 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
23:16 < bridge> <meloÆž> I'm in bed rn but if you remind me in like 18 hours I can send you some examples I use daily
23:19 < bridge> <Ewan> sweet
23:19 < bridge> <sollybunny> with styling of any kind, css sometimes randomly pops up. According to chatgpt Unity, Unreal, gnome, kde, macos themes, jetpack compose (android) and swiftui (ios) all have css options. you also cant understate the prevelance if not importance of the web. and css will show up almost everywhere just due to how much the web is everywhere
23:23 < bridge> <Ewan> letâ€™s clarify none of that is W3 compliant CSS
23:23 < bridge> <Ewan> everything you listed has its own distinct flavor of CSS which does not follow the spec and canâ€™t be treated as such
23:24 < bridge> <Ewan> this gets important when you want to use essentially any CSS3 featureâ€¦ youâ€™ll find that support outside of the web world is quite rare because itâ€™s conceptually tied very very heavily into the DOM
23:26 < bridge> <teero777> I like dom
23:26 < bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
23:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah but i think basic css features, that is element selection in some capacity then changing styling (colors, fonts, spacing) is enough to call css
23:28 < bridge> <sollybunny> yeah but i think basic css features, that is element selection in some capacity then changing styling (colors, fonts, spacing) is enough to call it css
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> definitely not these days
23:29 < bridge> <sollybunny> well... people these days flip flop between having 2000 elements for a profile picture and sticking an entire modal in a single element with :before and :after
23:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> the css we can access today (transforms, really cool layout stuff, animations) is, i feel isnt very what css was meant for, but... thats really the entire web wasnt meant for how large it was going to be
23:31 < bridge> <sollybunny> but yes i agree that w3 css and css looking styling shouldnt be conflated
23:33 < bridge> <Ewan> itâ€™s just very misleading to say all of those things have CSS support
23:33 < bridge> <Ewan> and those who add the half assed implementations are the main perpetrators of that
23:33 < bridge> <Ewan> but it is a completely different language
23:35 < bridge> <Ewan> Anyone with a modern knowledge of CSS would be very disappointed after spending 5 minutes writing the pseudo-CSS because theyâ€™ll see that their shit doesnâ€™t work and probably doesnâ€™t provide a real error
23:36 < bridge> <Ewan> like the KDE styling youâ€™re talking about is actually a characteristic of the QStyleSheetStyle class andâ€¦ you donâ€™t wanna see that parsing logic
23:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> css giving no errors has always been a problem lmao
23:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> but most of the time the css that is implemented isnt meant for the things that css has been forced to do on the web
23:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i think this is another one of those things where we arent even really arguing
23:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> we arent
23:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> discussions are cool
23:36 < bridge> <sollybunny> :)
23:37 < bridge> <Ewan> as long as I know itâ€™s a discussion
23:40 < bridge> <Ewan> https://codebrowser.dev/qt5/qtbase/src/gui/text/qcssparser_p.h.html
23:41 < bridge> <Ewan> all that private API drives this. not so important
23:41 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://codebrowser.dev/qt5/qtbase/src/widgets/styles/qstylesheetstyle.cpp.html>
23:43 < bridge> <sollybunny> it looks like im not sure whats really going on
23:43 < bridge> <sollybunny> apart from being suprised that positioning is supported
23:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i cant find the function i was thinking of
23:45 < bridge> <Ewan> and technically im on the clock
23:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i gotta lock in
23:45 < bridge> <sollybunny> x-x gl
