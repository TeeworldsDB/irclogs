02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> were these removed from the list accidentially, or for some reson on purpose? As they still do exist in client's console
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> didn't check any other removed ones, these 4 just caught my eye
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> > just use kill on/off bind
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> @louis  how?
04:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cfg files
04:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> search up "just bind it ddnet"
04:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its at the bottom of the original post
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Bind q kill = best
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I have it on `grave` (``~`) and happen to hit it accidentally
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd kill myself accidentally 50 times if I put it anywhere near WASD
16:29 <+NeXus> How do you convert names like this? https://ddnet.tw/players/-865--176--32--860--662--32--865--176-/
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://ddnet.tw/players/-40-1-41-brainless-32-te/
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks like `-{decimal}-` is replacing all URL-unsafe characters
16:39 <+NeXus> Ah you are using unicode decimals for that
16:40 <@deen> yeah, but it's not so nice. maybe we should switch to some standard way
16:40 <@deen> like the percent encoding
16:41 <+NeXus> yes urlencode is better
16:42 <+NeXus> Do you have a "user" table in the database? Best way would be to pass a user id in the url and search in the database with that id
16:42 <@deen> i don't remember why I didN't use it
16:42 <@deen> no, we don't, by design
16:43 <@deen> otherwise we'd have to keep all db servers around the world in sync
16:43 <@deen> just check in record_race
16:55 <@deen> uwsgi converts %2F to /, so we can't use percent encoded player names, that's the reason
16:55 <@deen> see for example https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/900
16:57 <@deen> could fix this by using ddnet.tw/players?name=foo%2Fbar, but I wanted to have it without the "?name="
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't for the life of me guess why they would do that
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> isn't there a setting somewhere to stop uwsgi from being stupid?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you find it we can fix it, I don't think so
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, the problem is probably that %2F is equivalent to /
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or that it should be
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> exactly. but i need to tell them apart
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, can you accept a literal / instead?
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, that runs into all sorts of troubles
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are things that normalize URLs, I don't think you can count on browsers etc. not normalizing %2F to /
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for /player/ yes, but not for /compare/
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that as well
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because (haven't looked it up) they're probably supposed to be equivalent for software dealing with URLs
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like %41 and A
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so, what could we do
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we could use xn-- encoding ðŸ˜›
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shereef> www.githubsatellite.com. Fantastic stuff if you want to watch
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, pretty interesting
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the guy on the play track is literally coding music
