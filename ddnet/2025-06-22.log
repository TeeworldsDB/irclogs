05:06 < bridge> <Ewan> hmm
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> is your exe older
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> new versions shouldnt need that
05:08 < bridge> <Ewan> or is it tclient or something
05:09 < bridge> <syrinok> Shrug, I just launch via my .exe pinned to my taskbar :greenthing:
05:10 < bridge> <syrinok> I don't use tclient
05:10 < bridge> <syrinok> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1386181557076623370/image.png?ex=6858c5ad&is=6857742d&hm=03eba5c61223d6b10babfbe416793cd169b31788a9f3ea40c1a18d81163e4f64&
05:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i changed something yesterday that should remove the requirement for the dll outright
05:11 < bridge> <syrinok> All I did was update via steam
05:11 < bridge> <Ewan> so if steam was "intelligently" removing the dll because it's not in the payload for the new version of the game, but the exe still depends on it, that might happen
05:11 < bridge> <Ewan> can you try verify game integrity
05:11 < bridge> <Ewan> in steam
05:12 < bridge> <syrinok> No dice
05:12 < bridge> <syrinok> Still the same
05:13 < bridge> <syrinok> Might force me to reinstall completely! Naughty Ewan
05:13 < bridge> <Ewan> dont
05:13 < bridge> <syrinok> dw I won't, too lazy
05:13 < bridge> <syrinok> You stopped me from playing ddnet, gg
05:14 < bridge> <Ewan> me as well
05:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i dont know
05:15 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't know how deen builds those...
05:16 < bridge> <Ewan> totally possible it was built with an outdated version of mingw that still puts the ssp functionality in its own DLL
05:16 < bridge> <Ewan> @0xdeen i think i broke it :x
05:29 < bridge> <Ewan> looking at the build/release scripts rn, i assume you're running arch for this. do you usually have issues when updating the compiler & libraries for releases?
05:58 < bridge> <pioooooo> I can play?
05:58 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1386193712337649844/b20c04a54594610e.png?ex=6858d0ff&is=68577f7f&hm=adef21c8281c8fc89059636bee60732c05b5e3b66830b8826262a498acbf36ec&
06:48 < bridge> <Ewan> just generated a new login token... am i banned or is kog tripping
06:48 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1386206097840406609/image.png?ex=6858dc88&is=68578b08&hm=9ac27023fb6e5901cbdd20cb02615cdb7e986e43d7ab3691789d42d4db6a5777&
07:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> $kog
07:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> Maybe takes time to update
09:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Does some ddnet admin have time to slide in my dms?
09:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you have dms?
09:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes matrix or irc. Preferably irc ofc
09:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I even have Heinrich on wire
09:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> phone wire?
09:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you just havea  direct line to heinrich
09:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> wire the messenger
09:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh
09:35 < bridge> <teero777> he has a literal direct wire to heinrich at all times
09:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yes
09:36 < bridge> <teero777> they both carry one end around
10:30 < bridge> <zhn> @blaiszephyr
10:30 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
10:30 < bridge> <melon> WHY ME
10:32 < bridge> <zhn> for whatever reason i thought #10392 is yours xd
10:32 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10392
10:35 < bridge> <Ewan> why am i getting confused with melon
10:35 < bridge> <melon> :dTeuPeposhrug:
10:35 < bridge> <zhn> he was talking about cmake bloat and then this pr popped in :kek:
10:35 < bridge> <melon> :kek: - i let Ewan do cmake shenanigans, i only did one cmake PR for mysql - and that one was hacky as hell
10:36 < bridge> <zhn> at least ddnet-mysql is compiling on windows with no additional pain in ass
10:37 < bridge> <totar> hahaha this commit is crazy https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10392/commits/ad250c74f1a74b3de6c1324fe739691961cca69d
10:37 < bridge> <totar> hahaha this commit is crazy <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10392/commits/ad250c74f1a74b3de6c1324fe739691961cca69d>
10:38 < bridge> <totar> farming lines changes
10:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> used a formatter
10:38 < bridge> <robyt3> ^ that's why I said to squash commits; this is not great for git bisect
10:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ?
10:39 < bridge> <totar> I think he means git blame
10:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ah
10:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> he undoes it
10:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> later
10:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> bonk
10:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> why is this merged
10:40 < bridge> <totar> yeah but all the lines are still attributed to him I think
10:40 < bridge> <totar> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blame/master/CMakeLists.txt>
10:40 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1386264611568750772/image.png?ex=68591306&is=6857c186&hm=f41373758741876fad131763039e4a81d10d7f57aeab2a59734726d4c94abe3e&
10:41 < bridge> <robyt3> That also I guess
10:41 < bridge> <robyt3> But this adds another commit for bit bisect and the large change means you need to rebuild the entire project if you pass this commit
10:43 < bridge> <totar> honestly I didn't even notice this the first time I looked at the PR because the changed files doesn't show it
10:43 < bridge> <totar> you could probably sneak a PR that changes the entire codebase
10:43 < bridge> <totar> deen obviously didn't notice
10:45 < bridge> <totar> who actually clicks on every commit before merging? no one does that
10:46 < bridge> <zhn> time to hard reset
10:46 < bridge> <zhn> :troll:
10:47 < bridge> <robyt3> I do, at least for my own PRs or if it makes the review easier
10:47 < bridge> <melon> i do that when reading Robys PR's :kek:
10:47 < bridge> <totar> well if it's your own PR you wrote every commit?
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> that doesn’t do anything?
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> the diff is evaluated for the whole pr
10:47 < bridge> <Ewan> assholr
10:47 < bridge> <totar> see conv
10:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, so I know the messages contain at least one mistake and the code maybe too
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```cpp
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> static char s_aTempName[BINDCHAT_MAX_NAME];
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> char *pName;

10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     if(LineInput.IsActive())
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         pName = s_aTempName;

10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     dbg_msg("FUCK", "FUCK %p '%s'\n", pOldBind, pName);
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     if(!pOldBind && pName[0] != '\0')
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     {
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         dbg_msg("FUCK", "FUCK %s\n", pName);
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         auto BindNew = BindDefault;
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         str_copy(BindNew.m_aName, pName);
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         GameClient()->m_BindChat.AddBind(BindNew);
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     }
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     if(pOldBind && pName[0] == '\0')
10:48 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     {
10:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>         GameClient()->m_BindChat.RemoveBind(pName);
10:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)>     }
10:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> }
10:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ```
10:49 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> when its empty and i type it goes into the lineinput edit but just prints `(null) ''`
10:49 < bridge> <totar> I'm saying that this is an issue with the PR process, I there's nothing checking for this kind of change everything and then revert when we merge PRs, it doesn't show total lines changed if they're reverted and each commit doesn't show lines changed unless you click it
10:49 < bridge> <melon> @mpft git blame is now you across the entrie cmakelists

10:49 < bridge> <totar> I'm saying that this is an issue with the PR process, there's nothing checking for this kind of change everything and then revert when we merge PRs, it doesn't show total lines changed if they're reverted and each commit doesn't show lines changed unless you click it
10:50 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, that's a UX issue with GitHub
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> I would have squashed if I had been at the computer between when it was said & when it was merged
10:50 < bridge> <Ewan> Idk man
10:51 < bridge> <Ewan> Sorry I touched anything lol
10:51 < bridge> <robyt3> It's fine, deen was too fast 🙂
10:51 < bridge> <robyt3> But back to the actual issue: Why is `libssp-0.dll` necessary for some Windows users and not for others?
10:52 < bridge> <robyt3> It works for me without the dll and I don't have it anywhere else on the path
10:52 < bridge> <robyt3> It works for me without the dll and I don't have it anywhere else on the path (Windows 10)
10:52 < bridge> <Ewan> I suspect it’s the version of the libraries on deen’s system when he runs the build + deploy scripts
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> I was messing with an arch wsl instance but the script kept not making sense and I had other things to do than make spitball guesses for his setup
10:53 < bridge> <Ewan> The SSP behavior is now in the mingwex library
10:57 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> deen insta explosion merge
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The linked mingw changelog suggest to not call `-lssp` anymore
11:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the dll is only kept for legacy reasons
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> LMAO
11:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> NOW that is commit farming
11:01 < bridge> <melon> :kek:
11:01 < bridge> <totar> now deen gets the git blame 🎉
11:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i like when deen merged my extra console colors
11:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but it had to many problems that regardless of feature accepted or not it was unmerged
11:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> xd
12:00 < bridge> <Assa> I know we have something like a jobqueue, how do I use it?
12:02 < bridge> <totar> it's rather complicated
12:03 < bridge> <totar> there's the IJob interface, I think you make a class that implements it
12:03 < bridge> <Assa> hmm interesting
12:04 < bridge> <totar> engine/shared/jobs.h
12:06 < ChillerDragon> @robyt3 are u only dev or do you also do other admin stuff?

12:08 < bridge> <totar> solly
12:08 < bridge> <totar> teero is offline
12:08 < bridge> <totar> do you want to help me test
12:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> okay
12:08 < bridge> <totar> ok
12:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> gimme a thing
12:08 < bridge> <totar> a thing?
12:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to run
12:09 < bridge> <totar> wait lets move somewhere else
12:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> or build
12:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> makes sense
12:24 < bridge> <teero777> not anymore!
12:31 < ChillerDragon> what was TEAM_FLOCK again?
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Your favorite team
12:31 < ChillerDragon> t0?
12:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
12:32 < ChillerDragon> what does FLOCK mean?
12:32 < ChillerDragon> i dont get the reference
12:32 < bridge> <totar> group of tees apparently
12:32 < bridge> <teero777> a flock of tees
12:32 < ChillerDragon> aaaa
12:32 < ChillerDragon> i remember that conversation xd
12:32 < ChillerDragon> hard to remember name
12:32 < ChillerDragon> hard to remember name -.-
12:32 < ChillerDragon> we need a comment for that
12:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Make pr, farm commit
12:33 < ChillerDragon> wording this comment is hard
12:33 < ChillerDragon> also so many wrong places to put it
12:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What
12:34 < bridge> <Assa> but the jobs aren't done in a multithreaded way, are they?
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The jobs run in parallel and in different threads than the main thread
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If that is what you are asking
12:35 < bridge> <Assa> yes it is, so I need a mutex lock on some parts
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they are hard to use but at least they dont block the main thread without you having to spawn threads
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You should simply not send anything from the main thread to it
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Any object the mainthread uses as well
12:36 < bridge> <Assa> I bet I can't upload to the gpu in parallel?
12:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ddnet uses mutexes :D
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yes you cannot
12:36 < bridge> <Assa> so I need the lock for the hardware, not due to some mainthread objects
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno what you are hoping to archieve, but sending multiple object create will not make the allocation multi threaded
12:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno what you are hoping to achieve, but sending multiple object create will not make the allocation multi threaded
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So or so, in OpenGL you cannot use multiple threads without doing platform specific/driver specific things
12:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Multithreading does not exist there
12:40 < bridge> <Assa> I am just making an excurse, might have no merit, might improve setup time
12:40 < bridge> <Assa> I am just making an excurse, might have no merit, might improve setup time, dunno needs testing
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You can improve setup time by processing multiple layers at once
12:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Regardless of GPU uploading
12:40 < bridge> <Assa> yeah exactly
12:41 < bridge> <Assa> part of the setup is gpu uploading, so I need to mutex lock it
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> No
12:41 < bridge> <Assa> otherwise you can't process multiple layers at once
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You can prepare them im std::vector and then upload afterwards in 1 thread
12:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You are making your life hard if you want mutibality over the whole graphics object
12:41 < bridge> <robyt3> Depends, I mostly deal with renames or triage tickets
12:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Generally you shouldn't access a job's data until the job is done, to avoid additional synchonization
12:46 < bridge> <Assa> except for checking it's done, I just need to initalize the job with data and let it run
12:47 < bridge> <Assa> like a batch job, at least I have something specific in mind, which I'll try out, which may work or not 🤷‍♂️
12:47 < bridge> <robyt3> Like prepare all layers in parallel?
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Honestly. The job pool isn't great for jobs that require only a short lifetime imo
12:48 < bridge> <Assa> yes, even worse, prepare all overlays in parallel
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> The job pool is more for jobs that run in background
12:49 < bridge> <robyt3> Yeah, job pool has no priority for jobs
12:49 < bridge> <Assa> so it might get stuck if other jobs are infront?
12:49 < bridge> <Assa> so it might get stuck if other jobs are infront which don't finish?
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> They might block you
12:49 < bridge> <robyt3> But I also considered that most of the client loading could be done in background threads/jobs and the loading screen just has to wait until all jobs are done
12:50 < bridge> <robyt3> There is only a limited number of threads in the pool, if all of them are busy with other jobs you might block
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> What you need is https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but for cpp 😬
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> One of the best libs :deen_star:
12:51 < bridge> <Assa> at some point I am finished with setting up everything, at this point I could let the mainthread pick some of my jobs and run them
12:51 < bridge> <Assa> at some point I am finished with setting up everything, at this point I could let the mainthread pick some of my jobs and run them if any are not running yet
12:51 < bridge> <Assa> but this is ofc even more advanced and overengineered
13:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @learath2 lerato u here?
13:36 < bridge> <learath2> Only sorta
13:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i will dm u irc
15:02 < bridge> <sans._.> What timezone do the servers use to log stuff in f2
15:03 < bridge> <sans._.> I'm guessing UTC +1, but is there also dls or not? Cuz germany time is UTC +2 in the summer
15:04 < bridge> <reitw> It should use localtime, depends how your server is configured
15:04 < bridge> <sans._.> i have no idea how the servers are configured lol
15:04 < bridge> <sans._.> im guessing they're all set to the same timezone?
15:04 < bridge> <sans._.> regardless of what region
15:04 < bridge> <reitw> Ig not for rus etc.
15:05 < bridge> <reitw> @learath2 or @0xdeen can probably answer that if that was a question related to ddnet servers
15:06 < bridge> <sans._.> yeah
15:06 < bridge> <learath2> Idk off the top of my head. I can check when I get to a computer
15:06 < bridge> <sans._.> please do :owo:
15:09 < bridge> <learath2> Chiller, I hope it's not urgent because idk if I can get to irc until later tonight
16:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not urgent

16:36 < bridge> <Assa> please add an X to close tab :justatest:
16:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Will still take a while though, it's only a proof of concept that it works at all. Change indicator should also be separate.
16:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Should all of the settings in the menu bar be different for each map?
16:40 < bridge> <kebscs> 1 fps?
16:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Tutorial is pretty slow because it's debug build. But otherwise having multiple maps open doesn't change anything
16:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Only the active map is rendered
16:40 < bridge> <Assa> I guess it only renders one map at a time, so not 1 fps

16:41 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its probably not that bad
16:41 < bridge> <robyt3> So far I'm only trying to move all members to `CEditorMap` that should be specified to each map. Adding support for multiple maps is relatively less code.

16:43 < bridge> <kebscs> very nice
17:00 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/10329>
17:00 < bridge> <kebscs> whats this failing integration test
17:06 < bridge> <robyt3> It's a line this PR adds: `if(mem_comp(&m_aClients[ClientId].m_LastPreInput, &PreInput, sizeof(CNetMsg_Sv_PreInput)) != 0)`
17:06 < bridge> <robyt3> Either `m_LastPreInput` or `PreInput` are not entirely initialized
17:06 < bridge> <robyt3> We had this problem with `NETADDR` padding a few days ago
17:07 < bridge> <robyt3> Would be cleaner to do `m_aClients[ClientId].m_LastPreInput != PreInput` instead of `mem_comp`, which may read uninitialized padding bytes
17:08 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ghasp cpp generated comparison operator!!!
17:15 < bridge> <robyt3> Doesn't look like it's padding because it's all `int`s
17:15 < bridge> <robyt3> Some member of `PreInput` are not set
17:15 < bridge> <kebscs> I dont think i can do !=  error C2678: binary '!=': no operator found which takes a left-hand operand of type 'CNetMsg_Sv_PreInput' (or there is no acceptable conversion)
17:16 < bridge> <robyt3> Should be enough to initialize `m_TargetX` and `m_TargetY` here
17:17 < bridge> <robyt3> What is this supposed to do? It copies `pInputData` into `PreInput` but not the target positions, which is uninitialized
17:17 < bridge> <robyt3> If you want to copy all then `PreInput = *pInputData;`
17:18 < bridge> <robyt3> Oh, I see, it's different types
17:18 < bridge> <kebscs> its different types and i dont want to update target all the time either
17:18 < bridge> <kebscs> ill try with targetx,y to 0
17:25 < bridge> <kebscs> why does it matter if its initialized or not if mem_comp takes the size of object
17:30 < bridge> <robyt3> `mem_comp` reads the uninitialized bytes so whether this `if` branch is taken is not defined
17:30 < bridge> <robyt3> `mem_comp` reads the uninitialized bytes so whether this `if` branch is taken is not clearly defined
17:32 < bridge> <robyt3> If you compile in with some compilers it might work correctly because they initialized to zero, but others initialized to 0xFF or leave uninitialized

18:00 < bridge> <Ewan> filthy commit farmer...
18:35 < bridge> <kebscs> Mem_zero before mem_comp worked
18:56 < bridge> <qq_akasha004> 50$ подарок - [steamcommunity.com/gift/activation=MJquTDgWlF](https://e.vg/MJquTDgWlF) @everyone
19:46 < bridge> <Assa> setting cl_refresh_rate to 1650 seems to not work, it seems to cap at 1000
20:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u need to use gfx refresh rate
20:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if you want to target fps
20:16 < bridge> <Assa> can sb help me get the diff from this repository to ddnet? <https://github.com/unique-clan/unique-race>
20:16 < bridge> <Assa> 
20:16 < bridge> <Assa> I want the changes from unique race in order to port it to the current ddnet version and apply it cleanly
20:16 < bridge> <Assa> problem is, I can't even do it over github, because it seems to be not shown as a fork
20:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Download the ddnet commit which this unqiue is based on.
20:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then replace all files with unique ones and do a commit
20:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Then you see the diff
20:23 < bridge> <Assa> 🤯 okay this is a very practical approach xD all what's left are commits cherry picked from upstream
20:27 < bridge> <Assa> yeah should work, this is the commit <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/a09fa562be4e28b058f7d341bbec2eb73df3a61c>
20:28 < bridge> <Assa> now I only need to integrate the changes from 7 years ago 😦
20:50 < bridge> <Assa> thank you, worked :deen_star:
20:50 < bridge> <Assa> just a small diff of 2.5 K lines ... but most is sixup code, that got merged later
20:57 < bridge> <bisooooofiac> hello
21:00 < bridge> <timakro> just got pointed here by tezcan. very good effort @essigautomat I did reintegrate ddnet changes for a few years and got lazy at some point ^^ having a version that is up to date with current ddnet would be amazing. there are also some changes in the unique fork i regret such as weird "using sql as message queue" stuff and subtick times which i'm not sure are even working correctly at this point
21:02 < bridge> <timakro> dream would be dropping the bad stuff and merging the good stuff into ddnet so unique can just run ddnet
21:02 < bridge> <timakro> just got pointed here by tezcan. very good effort @essigautomat I did reintegrate ddnet changes for a few years and got lazy at some point ^^ having a version that is up to date with current ddnet would be amazing. there are also some changes in the unique fork i regret such as weird and flaky "using sql as message queue" stuff and subtick times which i'm not sure are even working correctly at this point
21:12 < bridge> <Assa> @timakro just saying, we have our own room at the unique discord 😄
21:13 < bridge> <Assa> I can gurantee you, that the subtick times are not even working properly for ddnet 💀 and they're not letting me fix it due to compat issues
21:13 < bridge> <timakro> wait, does ddnet have subtick times?
21:14 < bridge> <Assa> not really, but it tries to correct for start/fin in the post-ddnet-tick
21:14 < bridge> <Assa> not really, but it tries to correct for start/fin in a post-tick
21:15 < bridge> <timakro> i just know that weird thing that the size of the hitbox of start and finish tiles is different when they are surrounded by air vs some non hitbox tile such as unfreeze
21:15 < bridge> <timakro> but can't be changed of course because it was like this forever
21:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @timakro: do you have a list of things that unique needs or that should be merged to ddnet?
21:25 < bridge> <timakro> fastcap is probably the biggest
21:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What does it do?
21:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Flags as start finish, anything else?
21:25 < bridge> <Assa> I have a list: damage (we have damage maps), fastcap, rank1 flags
21:25 < bridge> <timakro> let's you race fastcap maps, one flag is start the other finish basically. i don't remember the details
21:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So the only thing you need in ddnet is make flags start and finish? Xd
21:26 < bridge> <Assa> I have a list: damage (we have damage maps), fastcap, rank1 flags, subtick time measurement
21:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> None of these things sound easy to merge into ddnet. But it also does not sound like a lot either. Should be easy to keep a fork of ddnet with those changes that is low in merge maintenance
21:27 < bridge> <timakro> unique actually shows you carrying the flag and there are some convenience things e.g. you can pick spawn side to do it either left or right way however you prefer. doesn't have to be this way though as long as our times stay valid there are many ways to implement this
21:28 < bridge> <Assa> that's why I am going to work on this, my diff has 2.5K changes, remember there is more, things that are removed from ddnet and chat commands and stuff
21:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @essigautomat: Are you working on merging unique to new ddnet?
21:28 < bridge> <timakro> i think fastcap could actually be merged, especially if it means you can just load a fastcap map without modifications (i don't think we have this in unique)
21:28 < bridge> <Assa> if this is done we _could_, but I don't think the maintainers here would accept that, would they?
21:29 < bridge> <timakro> had some light approval on merging fastcap into ddnet when i asked a year ago or so under condition that it's done well and cleanly
21:29 < bridge> <timakro> but yeah i don't have the motivation to do that stuff :D
21:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> \#7777 Moment
21:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It’s funny I randomly asked tezcan a few days ago when he will update unique race. Such a coincidence you are working on it
21:30 < bridge> <Assa> bad bot
21:30 < bridge> <DDNet> :C
21:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The bot does not see me
21:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Which means I can also ghost ping and get away with it
21:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @essigautomat:
21:31 < bridge> <timakro> and i am not at all opposed to removing non vital unique features if it makes dev life easier though tezcan may disagree
21:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> There is a big differences between code changes that are done without thinking about future merges and ones that have upstream in mind
21:31 < bridge> <Assa> well the subtick time measurement feature would be a blocker, I don't think ddnet would want that and I don't think unique would want to miss it
21:32 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Doesn’t unique have a slightly different 0.7 bridge as well?
21:32 < bridge> <timakro> i half agree but I more and more think it's bogus so having it in unique is also pointless ^^
21:32 < bridge> <Assa> if it does, then i am going to throw it away
21:33 < bridge> <timakro> chiller is correct, you should throw it away and use ddnet 0.7 implementation
21:33 < bridge> <Assa> if it does, then i am going to throw it away (talking about 0.7 bridge)
21:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I mean ddnet implementation was born out of your efforts @timakro but I guess they got finalized and refactored differently
21:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Two forks building the same feature but different that makes me quite nervous
21:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Two forks building the same feature but different is something that makes me quite nervous
21:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> If you want to hire an consultant with 10 years experience in merging into ddnet, let me know. Do you remember that you were the one that introduced me to git @timakro you said you won’t contribute unless I use git. And you set me up with self hosted git and a new repo empty git history from scratch. I now merged that exact git history on top of ddnet and am now following updates quite frequently xd
21:58 < bridge> <timakro> haha I don't remember
21:58 < bridge> <timakro> i merged ddnet for 2 years or so and got so annoyed ^^
22:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh no you don’t remember? .\_. That’s sadge
22:07 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But you are @timakro as in Tim Timakro DoNe?
22:07 < bridge> <timakro> yeah
22:08 < bridge> <timakro> you make me realize i change names quite frequently ^^
22:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fr
22:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea you went full senpai back then. I wanted help in ddnet++ and you installed me some git bash on windows and setup a git repo on my VPS. Then you said you enjoy coding in that code base because you can write crappy code and nobody will complain. You added a backdoor with your name encoded as numbers and got annoying by me adding compiler warnings with every new commit xd
22:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Good times
22:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I fell in love with git thanks to your push
22:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Will never forget
22:11 < bridge> <timakro> i remember the crappy code thing sorry about that btw and the backdoor with my name obfuscated :D
22:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Don‘t worry your epic features are still going strong today. Much appreciated. And finding that „backdoor“ was hilarious
22:12 < bridge> <timakro> is that where i made that trail that uses A* or something?
22:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi Tim!
22:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi Timakro!
22:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
22:20 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @timakro: yea some trails, atoms and homing missiles
22:21 < bridge> <timakro> heya
