00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ReiTW | Blizzard there you go ^
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> hoo 😄
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <toast.tw> @deen Why is it required to list a custom component (e.g. in game/client/components) in the CMakeList.txt? o.O
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @toast.tw we used to have a glob for the source files but apparently cmake guys recommend actually listing all the files
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32411963/why-is-cmake-file-glob-evil
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <toast.tw> @Learath2  @Ryozuki Ok, I am fine with this workflow :) just wondered how it works
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> How do I save records in database instead of file with ddnet mod?
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Are there config commands?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> @NeXus you need to build the server with sql support and have a db running, you can find explanations on github
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Why doesnt the default ddnet mod have sql support?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> And thanks, I will have a look
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> no idea exactly but i mean it's more libraries, more code so more possible issues, and for tests or making your own server you really don't need it
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wolftom> How ddnet was made?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wolftom> Just modding the tw gamefiles?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> yeah
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wolftom> wow, what an amazing job
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wolftom> i just know Java, this game was made in C++ i guess right?
19:44 <+Ryozuki> c/c++
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wolftom> ?
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bardia_Sahami> hi
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bardia_Sahami> downloaded the ddnet maps, how should I update the vote settings?
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bardia_Sahami> to cover the entire maps?
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> in the ddnet-maps repo you cloned you have a example configuration which is like what you get on ddnet's server, all maps and all types accessible by votes; you can see how it's done, copy/modify it and so on
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> u see that types are included in storage.cfg and such
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> On windows's released .zip storage.cfg get unix line endings, i guess that's fine for almost all text editor except windows notepad
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> Anyone else reported much longer loading times at tabbing in and out since last update?
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on debian for me its instant
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it sometimes bugs really weirdly
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to the point where it changes my resolution
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and its shit cuz i have to use fullscreen instead of borderless, because on borderless it runs at 60hz for some reaon while on fullscreen at 144hz
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i cant go back to peasant 60hz
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <♪♫> no issue here, i often tab in and out switching between screen and did not notice anything
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> For me borderless works with 144hz by the way. Then i guess i check my graphic drivers they had updates recently as well.
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its a windows thing
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i posted the fix few times here already
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "windows settings -> system -> focus assist -> uncheck all"
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ScReeNy we downgraded from SDL 2.0.9 to 2.0.8 because of a bug, I guess that's what's causing it
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dᴀɴʏ~> Hi, one question .. I can see the 50 - 10 players who have passed a map instead of just 5?
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> \
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> \/top5 5
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> etc.
