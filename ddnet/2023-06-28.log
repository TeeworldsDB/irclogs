12:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i get this compiling ppp
12:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> do u think this is a lld specific error?
12:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i use lld on gentoo
12:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> looks like something was compiled for the wrong arch?
12:09 <+bridge> <learath2> elf32, how did that happen?
12:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder too xD
12:09 <+bridge> <learath2> Well best way to check if its an lld issue is to try with ld
12:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> can i override the linker for this specific package only
12:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -fuse-ld=lld"
12:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is whati  have
12:10 <+bridge> <learath2> Seems gcc produced 64bit objects as requested, why lld is linking them into an elf32 binary idk

12:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think i know
12:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -fuse-ld=ld"
12:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> right
12:13 <+bridge> <learath2> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Portage/Advanced#Per-package_environment_variables

12:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think the env is incremental right? so how can i set fuse-ld back to ld
12:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is that the correct way?
12:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hm this seems to happen when ldflags is wrong
12:29 <+bridge> <deen> Why not use mold systemwide?
12:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> because it may have bugs
12:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> like lld here
12:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> using mold with ppp fixed it tho
12:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> maybe i should use mold xD
12:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> iim just not sure its the best idea to use it systemwide
12:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh
12:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in gentoo wiki they show it
12:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -fuse-ld=mold -Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed"
12:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i guess ill use mold
12:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 what is the -O1 in ldflags?
12:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is o2 better?
12:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> anyway fixed
13:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> clang: symbol lookup error: clang: undefined symbol: _ZN4llvm24DisableABIBreakingChecksE, version LLVM_16
13:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my clang broke
13:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh nvm
13:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/madsim-rs/madsim
13:45 <+bridge> <learath2> There is a reason even gentoo users who love messing with things don't usually replace the linker and compiler üòÑ
13:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the clang thing was cuz another unrelated reason t ogentoo
13:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its cuz i had set manually ld library path for smth in a rust project that uses llvm
13:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> might not be a bug, just a difference in interface
13:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i guess
15:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i have a coworker  who met stallman and got his laptop signed

16:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> [citation needed]
16:04 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> proof or its fake
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I already posted it here. Ryo knows that
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> He protects him anyway
16:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Here it's even in Wikipedia
16:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Section criticism
16:07 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh ew i read the controversies page on the wiki
16:07 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i hate this guy
16:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that was quick
16:08 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I did not find any statement that implies he's a pedophile
16:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then u are a fan buy
16:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Boy
16:08 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no
16:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm pretty sure u are not blind
16:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So it must be the first
16:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> please cite a sentence if you think that it's obvious
16:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I see a controversy about him talking about pedophilia
16:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not about him being a pedophile
16:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah. He basically said it's ok to be pedo
16:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And that is what a pedo days
16:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Says
16:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> saying "it's ok to kill people" is different from actually killing people
16:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if you want to dilute definitions like that, sure
16:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
16:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Pedo is nothing active
16:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> He doesn't need to fuck kids to be a pedo
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he is not pedo
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he never did anything to kids
16:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u may think he is weird sure
16:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he did not commit any crime
16:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think you need to be very clear on that. I'd guess a non-vanishing amount of people would connect "pedo" to be someone actively abusing children
16:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You think way too good about people
16:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> you go for the "possible" bad things in people to make their arguments less
16:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> There are no good people
16:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> by this, you are a pedo too
16:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just cuz i think ur weird
16:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and u like ur nephew right?
16:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> isnt this view rly diluted
16:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but its ur view
16:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> critical thinking
16:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://stallmansupport.org/
16:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> My niece is awesome, but i don't feel in any way sexually attracted to her, nor would I want anyone to have this kind of attitude. This is simply a red flag for me. Even if medicine would say it's not their fault
16:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it doesnt matter how u feel
16:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ur a pedo
16:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The damage done to kids is simply too big
16:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he also never said he feels "sexually attracted to kids" that i remember
16:18 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> bro im not gonna support with shit takes like his
16:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It matters how i think about this topic. I can not relate to other people having sexual thoughts about kids. And because I don't like the damage done, i don't support it or support others supporting it
16:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> All of these are red flags
16:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> which takes
16:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i meant that more as in accusing someone of being a pedo, it doesnt matter according to ur arguments
16:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u didnt do any crime, but by ur logic, that doesnt matter
16:19 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> the takes on?? how he defended a sex offender??
16:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> where?
16:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If i tell my kids killing others every day. Then it's my fault if they go on assaults
16:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Killing others is good*

16:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no, i quote the reality
16:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ur just being misguided by cancel bros
16:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> This is like saying CO2 is good for climate change and quoting some bullshit websites
16:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> tbf you're not quoting anything
16:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I said where u can read it
16:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if u mean the images, its cuz i dont want to lose the format
16:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> "do you research"
16:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> "believe me!"
16:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (I meant @jupeyy_keks
16:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> )
16:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ok Heinrich i know u are the last person to ever accept u are wrong and not a good person. But when I say at this link, in this section. Then it's basically like a quote
16:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> what link?
16:24 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think he refers to the controversy section of the wikipedia article on stallman
16:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the link i sent literally debunks the "controversies" on the section of the wiki
16:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What is there to debunk?
16:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's a quote
16:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > In September 2006, Stallman wrote, ‚ÄúI am skeptical of the claim that voluntarily [sic] pedophilia harms children. The arguments that it causes harm seem to be based on cases which aren't voluntary, which are then stretched by parents who are horrified by the idea that their little baby is maturing.‚Äù In 2019, after conversations with victims, he changed his opinion that it does cause harm. [117][118][119]
16:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it seems at one point, he said "I don't think voluntary pedophilia causes harm". later, after a controversy, he reversed that opinion
16:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And the section after
16:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> god
16:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> please tell me what I should read
16:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Quoting on phone sucks
16:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > In September 2018, Stallman again attracted controversy when he wrote on his website, ‚ÄúHowever, it is normal for adults to be physically attracted to adolescents,‚Äù in a defense of convicted sex offender Cody Wilson. [120]
16:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this?
16:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
16:26 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> yeah that
16:27 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ryoz apperantly cant read so idk why he asked me where
16:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> idk whether it's normal to be attracted to the same sex or to children, but we can look up data on that I guess. it also doesn't say anything about the morality of it AFAICT
16:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, according to wikipedia, pedophilia stops at age 13? so the quote doesn't even relate to the strict sense of the word?
16:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well as i explained. To me it's a red flag
16:31 <+bridge> <murpi> üëÄ wtf is going on here
16:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Fanboys vs realism basically
16:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Deleting the truth again nice

16:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its good read it all, stallman rly likes being pedantic
16:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
16:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > The article refers to the sex worker as a "child", but that is not so. Elsewhere it has been published that she is 16 years old. That is late adolescence, not childhood. 
16:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
16:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > In this case, the effect of that mislabeling is to smear Wilson. It is rare, and considered perverse, for adults to be physically attracted to children. However, it is normal for adults to be physically attracted to adolescents. Since the claim sbout Wilson is the latter, it is wrong to present it as the former.
16:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> [citation needed]
16:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> .
16:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > However, it is normal for adults to be physically attracted to adolescents.
16:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> wikipedia suggests that there are no studies on this
16:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> look on pornhub, the amount of vids with "teen" in the title
16:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:34 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > The prevalence of hebephilia within the general population is unknown. There is evidence suggesting that within clinical and correctional samples,[29][30] as well as anonymous surveys of people sexually interested in children, there are more individuals with an erotic interest in pubescent rather than in prepubescent children.[31][32]
16:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki voluntary pedophilia is already a red flag
16:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> How should a kid be able to decide this?
16:35 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i almost laughed when it said she was 16
16:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Were u so self aware with 12?
16:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he changed his stance  on that after someone talked him about this
16:36 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> also?? no it isnt normal for adults to be attracted to adolescents?? go for someone your own age you creep
16:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> society seems to like em tho, look at porn sites
16:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what do you mean by "normal"?

16:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> should be accepted by society? is accepted by society? happens a lot?
16:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> saying normal also doesnt mean he says its correct tho
16:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In Germany there currently is lot of discussion about the church and priests abusing children and they often talk about it in their adult age firstly
16:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If we want to talk about, what is moral. Then we can change topic
16:38 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> it isnt morally right
16:38 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> like its insinuating a big age gap
16:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> There is no good and evil
16:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so "normal" = "should be accepted by society"?
16:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> in your sentence
16:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> or "not normal" = "should not be accepted by society"?
16:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> or the same said differently: "not normal" = "should not be accepted by society"?
16:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Even that is hard. Slavery was once normal
16:39 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but u dont see the irony here?
16:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The slaves still suffered
16:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he never said otherwise
16:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for the adolescents
16:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> saying something is normal as in it frequently happens doesnt mean u agree with it
16:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Anyway. This discussion is too creepy. A person of public has the risk to lose his image. Be it by accident, by stupidy or what ever
16:41 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6775#issuecomment-1611573212
16:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> a person of public?
16:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> A person in pubic
16:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno
16:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> any idea how one could statelessly figure out the target of a grenade/hook teleporter?
16:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Use tick as seed
16:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this opens the cheat problem
16:42 <+bridge> <deen> That is a flag for the linker, not for the compiler, as indicated by the `-Wl,` prefix
16:42 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> where a cheat could help you hit the teleporter at the right time
16:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> re: i guess discussing "taboos" being seen as bad is why they still are taboos, a self feeding cycle
16:43 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it'd be nicer if it was timing-independent
16:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye, i wanted to know what it does and if there is o2
16:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i cant find any docs
16:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think the game should be fully predictable
16:43 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I agree
16:43 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but it'd be nice if it was predictable for humans, too
16:43 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so you don't have to time it for the correct tick
16:43 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks it should be machine predictable imho, but not in a way a player can predict something in a obvious way
16:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just to support prediction
16:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't like that. this encourages cheats
16:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well then i don't have a strong opinion
16:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> then whats the point of the random teleports
16:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just force 1 out tele
16:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Any of them are better than what we have now
16:44 <+bridge> <deen> Mostly optimize the symbol table, I haven't seen -O2 for any linker
16:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think so people don't clutter so much
16:45 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> also, we have tons of legacy maps üòâ
16:45 <+bridge> <deen> Oh, lld has -O2 as well for string tail merging
16:45 <+bridge> <deen> and compresses debug sections
16:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nice
16:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and mold? xd
16:45 <+bridge> <deen> mold doesn't have it documented in their manpage üòÑ
16:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> true xd
16:47 <+bridge> <deen> According to the source code it's a no-op in mold: https://github.com/rui314/mold/blob/d4d93d7fb72dd19c44aafa4dd5397e35787d33ad/elf/cmdline.cc#L1050C7-L1053

16:53 <+bridge> <deen> computers are so fast nowadays. My initial Gentoo setup was on an Athlon XP, that would have taken a day probably if I didn't have to start swapping, then a few days
16:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> haha
16:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> also i have only 1 job at 16 cores
16:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i find its faster  for me
16:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so it was dedicated at compiling llvm
16:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and the files are on a tmpfs on ram
16:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> (1 emerge job, make at 16 threads)
16:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> most bloated are llvm, firefox, nodejs
16:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in decreasing time
16:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 30, 15, 10
16:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i guess nodejs builds v8 or smth
16:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> python is fast af
16:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 50 secs
16:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> rust software is slow?
16:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i dont have rust compiled, i use the binary, which is probs faster  because they use LTO + the BOLT
16:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and i use rustup anyway
16:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> go also takes 1 min
16:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rust would probs be slow af
16:58 <+bridge> <deen> Yes, do you have any tips to make huge Rust projects compile faster? üòÑ
16:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xdd
16:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yes
16:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u can make a dev profile that compiles libraries dynamically
16:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> bevy suggests this for quick iterations when making games
16:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/#enable-fast-compiles-optional
16:59 <+bridge> <ryozuki> read
16:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it seems to me that speed is a fundamental problem, and would need to be designed in from the get-go
16:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think you'll get large performance increases on existing software
17:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i rly wonder where the bottleneck in rust is, apparently its not the borrow checker
17:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think its rust spitting out a lot of unneeded llvm IR instructions and llvm needing to do lot more work
17:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> unneeded but make writing the compiler frontend probs easier
17:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that being said, there are a couple of hints out there, I think. e.g. https://endler.dev/2020/rust-compile-times/
17:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm
17:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think this wasn't the blog post I meant
17:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but rust is faster than rly big c++ projects i think
17:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or so i heard
17:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> (comparing big projects)
17:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> unfortunately, it's still slow
17:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> C++ isn't exactly known for its fast compilation
17:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
17:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> do you mean locally (incremental) or in CI (full builds)?
17:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @deen if u make heavy use of proc macros, i recommend setting the proc macro crate to build with optimizations
17:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> sqlx recommends this
17:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i read this somewhere too in a proc macro to serialize json at build time
17:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> [profile.dev.package.sqlx-macros]
17:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> opt-level = 3
17:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > Compile-time verified queries do quite a bit of work at compile time. Incremental actions like cargo check and cargo build can be significantly faster when using an optimized build by putting the following in your Cargo.toml (More information in the Profiles section of The Cargo Book)
17:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> <https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx>
17:04 <+bridge> <deen> full
17:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> cache your dependency compilation, like https://github.com/Swatinem/rust-cache/
17:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it shaved off a couple of minutes in a big project I contribute to
17:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but first, reduce the unnecessary dependencies, I guess :p
17:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. I found that the project depended on both async-std and tokio
17:06 <+bridge> <deen> That looks promising, I played around with https://github.com/mozilla/sccache already, but wasn't that helpful
17:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```

17:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki>       toolchain: stable 18 months ago
17:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u can have a window in the toolchain
17:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I prefer to have fixed versions that you manually upgrade
17:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it also supports that
17:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but this may be e.g for a check on supported versions
17:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> `toolchain: stable minus 8 releases`
17:17 <+bridge> <totar> @heinrich5991 could you maybe specify what your cheating concern is exactly so I can think about if it can be avoided? Are there any maps where influencing the teleport result is a huge advantage?
17:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> my cheating concern is that this can be used to influence teleporter output to get faster runs
17:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the only way to do this would be a custom client, because we can't integrate anything like that in the ddnet client (I think)
17:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> however, if we design it in a way a human could determine the target teleporter in our ddnet client
17:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> then the cheating angle goes away completely
17:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because there's nothing the ddnet client can't do
17:23 < bridge_> <totar> lets say the teleport seed changes every time you teleport and not at other times.
17:23 < bridge_> <totar> 
17:23 < bridge_> <totar> If the map heavily rewards teleporter rng then knowing the exit doesn't matter because you will get a new seed at the start of each run. so the human player will need to just go through every teleporter as fast as they can and hope they get good rng, even if they know the teleporter exit each time they would still need to enter another teleporter to change it which takes time, so a speedrun would effectively play the same.
17:23 < bridge_> <totar> 
17:23 < bridge_> <totar> A cheater can know the teleport result of all teleports in the run at the time they spawn so they still have the advantage because they can just kill over and over until they see every teleport in the run is good for them.
17:24 < bridge_> <totar> we would effectively need to impliment advanced teleport forcasting tools in order to be on par with the cheater if the seed is fixed
17:24 < bridge_> <totar> we would effectively need to implement advanced teleport forecasting tools in order to be on par with the cheater if the seed is fixed
17:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think that situation would be better
17:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> people could create third-party tools to check whether teleporters align
17:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and then execute their run
17:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> whereas in the "dependent on tick" thing, we now introduce pixel-perfectness into the run
17:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> which isn't really possible except with letting the client steer the tee
17:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> which is something we'd like to avoid
17:27 < bridge_> <totar> sure but the cheater is also dependent on the tick, they wouldn't be able to predict every teleport in the run at the start which is the same as the player
17:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I guess the question is whether this tool is still a cheat. I'd say no, it's just some information you get before you start executing your run
17:27 < bridge_> <totar> ok but I thought we don't allow prediction path cheats isn't this the same?
17:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, this means they'll need to use their tool all the time during the run
17:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> at that point, I'd say this is no longer a cheat ^^
17:28 < bridge_> <totar> I think you're underestimating the power of that kind of tool
17:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why is that?
17:29 < bridge_> <totar> I can turn ddnet into a rhythm game where the player doesn't even need to know how to play
17:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah
17:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> wait
17:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think I misunderstood
17:31 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, we don't allow to show how your tee should move
17:32 < bridge_> <totar> isn't it the same as the teleport predicter? you get your velocity and position and map from debug info, you could put them read them in real time and put them into a third party tool
17:32 < bridge_> <totar> isn't it the same as the teleport predicter? you get your velocity and position and map from debug info, you could  read them in real time and put them into a third party tool
17:32 < bridge_> <totar> isn't it the same as the teleport predicter? you get your velocity and position and map from debug info, you could read them in real time and put them into a third party tool
17:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> one of them happens once and can be done asynchronously
17:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what I want is not giving cheaters more advantages
17:35 < bridge_> <totar> I still think it's reasonable to just set sv_teleport_seeded 0 on the maps where it matters.
17:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm not going to go through 2000 maps
17:36 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if it doesn't matter, could we just use the solution where it's predictable?
17:36 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> since it doesn't matter anyway?
17:37 < bridge_> <totar> I dont even know how to impliment that solution
17:37 < bridge_> <totar> this one is so elegant :(
17:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, in fact the solution isn't fully thought out yet (see grenades/hook)
17:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think it's not that elegant that it depends on the tick
17:37 < bridge_> <totar> lots of games already do it like this
17:37 < bridge_> <totar> thats where I got the idea
17:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> which games e.g.?
17:38 < bridge_> <totar> randomizing based on tick?
17:38 < bridge_> <totar> mario maker
17:38 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> do they have teleprots? oO
17:38 < bridge_> <totar> no but it's the same idea
17:38 < bridge_> <totar> they make a truly random seed at the start then seed it with the tick
17:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't see the advantage of doing that instead of stepping the rng each time you ask it for a random number
17:39 < bridge_> <totar> because this is stateless
17:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> also seems pretty "elegant" to me
17:39 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I see

20:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki 
20:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
20:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> // Avoid `Option::ok_or_else` because it bloats LLVM IR.
20:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
20:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Can you verify this üòÇ
20:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is your job right, llvm ir üòÑ
20:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks idk but there is a trick to avoid lot of monomorphication
20:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the std does it extensively
20:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fck i forgot the example
20:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but for example say u have  a fn accepting
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```rust
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pub fn a<T>(a: impl Into<X>) -> bla {
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki>   let x = a.into();
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki>   // ... lots of code here!
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> }
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> // beter
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fn a_better<T>(a: impl Into<X>) -> bla {
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki>   a_impl(a.into())
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> }
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fn a_impl(a: X) -> bla {
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki>   // ... lots of code here!
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> }
20:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the generic function has a small body
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> so it only duplicates the least amount of code
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think its good method to reduce code size
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i found it on a blog i forgot sadly
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```rust
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pub fn a<T>(a: impl Into<X>) -> bla {
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki>   let x = a.into();
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki>   // ... lots of code here!
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> }
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> // beter
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pub fn a_better<T>(a: impl Into<X>) -> bla {
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki>   a_impl(a.into())
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> }
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> fn a_impl(a: X) -> bla {
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki>   // ... lots of code here!
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> }
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
20:13 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a_impl is private obv
20:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this obviously reduces emitted ir
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i c
20:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i wonder if rust does this automatically sometimes
20:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with lto it will probably choose the best path
20:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> best code is no code
20:17 < bridge_> <gerdoe> thought this trick heavily used in libtw2 but seems its not
20:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks also its recommended  to put #inline in pub methods of crates meant to be libraries
20:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cuz inline allows cross crate inline
20:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> otherwise not
20:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> btw u can put inline in trait impls iirc
20:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah, kinda annoying tbh
20:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> without LTO world ends
20:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
20:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its tryhard trick anyway üòÇ
20:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye xd
20:25 < bridge_> <gerdoe> the callback and warning systems in libtw2 look tryhard
20:25 < bridge_> <gerdoe> xd
20:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @admin can we host a gores section and also remove the kog tab btw?
20:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lel
20:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hi adm
20:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @murpi @deen @heinrich5991 @robyt3 @learath2 
20:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with forced accounts that we can't control this does not require active support from us anymore imo
20:34 < bridge_> <totar> :Avo: :justatest:
20:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> welcome to apple, closed ecosystem
20:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> eat or die
20:37 < bridge_> <gerdoe> i think players should be able to categorize their favorite servers
20:37 < bridge_> <gerdoe> like making lists
20:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1123683535610458252/image.png
20:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for context
20:37 < bridge_> <gerdoe> so ddnet will go with no ddnet and kog tabs
20:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye was reading
20:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i dislike the company-talk on a open source game
20:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> looks so fake xd
20:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> repeated msg
20:38 < bridge_> <gerdoe> also theres filter for official servers?
20:40 < bridge_> <totar> is this technically any different from fokkonaut?
20:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i never joined it, does it force accounts too?
20:40 < bridge_> <totar> I think for most features you need it
20:40 < bridge_> <totar> idk either
20:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we shouldnt actively support these communities
20:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this game is free:
20:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> free as in money
20:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> free as in open source
20:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> free as in forced accounts
20:41 < bridge_> <learath2> What is tonights drama?
20:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kog
20:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this game is free:
20:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> free as in money
20:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> free as in open source
20:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> free as in no forced accounts
20:41 < bridge_> <totar> idk I feel like you need accounts for some gamemodes, fokkonaut seems justified because the players can store coins
20:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 kog corpo speak news that accounts only
20:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just to be clear, they can do what they want
20:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> idc
20:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we just should not actively promote these communities
20:42 < bridge_> <learath2> Ok how does that concern us?
20:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its already a pain that they are closed source
20:42 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kog tab in ddnet client
20:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can never play gores again?
20:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it concerns me a lot
20:42 < bridge_> <learath2> Ok how does that concern us as in ddnet?
20:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 kog tab promotes this
20:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well without gores i basically dont play this game
20:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> replace kog tab for unique ty
20:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we need to make a good alternative to kog, so the gores community can continue without this bullshit
20:43 < bridge_> <learath2> I mean complaining at kog people would be a better use of your time in that case, no?
20:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> no, ddnet has control over client
20:44 < bridge_> <totar> I suspect thats not true lol
20:44 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also we shouldnt promote a community with forced accounts, optional is ok, but this looks like info laundering project
20:44 < bridge_> <learath2> I don't think we can. @heinrich5991 thinks we are too much of a monopoly already, he would never approve a hostile takeover of the gores community
20:45 < bridge_> <learath2> Having interacted with kog people before I highly doubt it's a info laundering scheme. They just probably got bored of not being to enforce any rules
20:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> people who dont want to share their info or have a fingerprint (account) cant play gores now
20:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> <@&985934422547255311> pls dont have this strong opinion, <@&985934422547255311> pls dont have this strong opinion, <@&985934422547255311> pls dont have this strong opinion, <@&985934422547255311> pls dont have this strong opinion, <@&985934422547255311> pls dont have this strong opinion, <@&985934422547255311> pls dont have this strong opinion, <@&985934422547255311> pls dont have this strong opinion, <@&985934422547255311> pls dont have this
20:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> doesnt matter
20:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i cant even ping him, lel
20:45 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or i pinged his role
20:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> role
20:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
20:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> kog was always a pain bcs they never updated...
20:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> now they finally did, and start new shit xD
20:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lets just get monopoly, who cares
20:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> open source monopoly üò¨
20:47 < bridge_> <learath2> Fwiw if I was hosting a network it would be accounts only too. Not very identifying accounts but accounts only
20:47 < bridge_> <learath2> The only thing I despise more than breaching privacy is edgy children. It drives me mental
20:48 < bridge_> <learath2> These 10 year olds coming to this discord after getting banned for botting bragging about how they evaded their bans make me want to put my fist through my monitor
20:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
20:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the only annoying ones for me are the wanna be coders trying to make bots
20:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> makes me lose faith in new gen coders
20:49 < bridge_> <learath2> Not being able to enforce any rules is so annoying when managing a community
20:50 < bridge_> <learath2> You can't steer the ship at all. It's sinking and the best you can do is get more mods to bucket the water out of the ship
20:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 well trouble wouldnt stop
20:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> a dedicated troll can do lots of acc
20:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> proxies
20:50 < bridge_> <ryozuki> etc
20:51 < bridge_> <learath2> Anyway, we were planning to drop the kog and ddnet either way, maybe it's a good motivator for someone to code an alternative
20:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> buy some nigerian princes to skip captcha cheap
20:51 < bridge_> <murpi> Why though
20:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its deeply discussed
20:51 < bridge_> <learath2> I would so ID everyone with their real government ids. I seem to have gotten too old for the internet shenanigans
20:51 < bridge_> <ryozuki> see t he issue
20:51 < bridge_> <totar> sort browser by gamemodes instead
20:51 < bridge_> <totar> sort browser by gamemodes instead @murpi
20:52 < bridge_> <learath2> People don't like that we promote any server at all
20:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wasnt the plan just to rename it
20:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> to community
20:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and even add other communities xD
20:52 < bridge_> <learath2> Nah, I think in the issue the best we came up with was to add groupings in the Internet tab
20:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks https://uniqueclan.net/
20:52 < bridge_> <ryozuki> best clan
20:53 < bridge_> <murpi> Oh, that's nice I guess
20:54 < bridge_> <totar> the master server itself is already an authority of sorts by enforcing bans and rules
21:21 < bridge_> <totar> I made some concepts a long time ago for a different server browser style but no one gave feedback so idk if people want it.
21:21 < bridge_> <totar> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5665#issuecomment-1198110266
21:22 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> ooh i like this!
21:22 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> maybe this will get ppl to play other gamemodes more
21:26 < ChillerDragon> @learath2 if you make up rules in a online game where you fully control the server software and can't enforce them. You should drop the rules imo.
21:26 < bridge_> <learath2> I can enforce them, but not without making the privacy nuts mad
21:26 < ChillerDragon> rules is just a legacy leftover from the offline world
21:26 < ChillerDragon> online games should be anarchy
21:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> chiller is alive
21:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> like teesmash, the best mod
21:27 < ChillerDragon> jopsti ddnet has gores maps so all good right?
21:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i also found out i have a map in kog
21:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i forgot totally
21:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xdd
21:28 < ChillerDragon> the deep fried
21:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ChillerDragon: no u
21:28 < ChillerDragon> wo
21:28 < ChillerDragon> t
21:28 < bridge_> <learath2> DDNet client is now 100‚Ç¨, I reserve all rights to revoke your server privileges with no refund
21:28 < ChillerDragon> it has
21:28 < bridge_> <learath2> There all rules are now enforceable
21:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> So true
21:28 < ChillerDragon> lerato being edgy once again
21:29 < ChillerDragon> jopsti wats ddnet gores missing?
21:29 < bridge_> <learath2> You were the one who said if you can't enforce it they should be removed. I've shown that they can be enforced thus there is no need to remove them
21:30 < ChillerDragon> ok go enforce em then
21:30 < bridge_> <learath2> Can I start by enforcing the no more than 4 tees rule on you?
21:30 < ChillerDragon> making ddnet client more expensive than free is instant playerbase drop
21:30 < ChillerDragon> oh no
21:30 < ChillerDragon> im quiet
21:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ChillerDragon: all insane, all mind maps, 99% fliplipp, ckis maps, bzw maps
21:30 < ChillerDragon> rules good
21:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> basically all cool
21:30 < ChillerDragon> dont enforce all
21:30 < ChillerDragon> thank
21:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ChillerDragon: and chillerdragon 18
21:31 < ChillerDragon> so u miss maps?
21:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the best map
21:31 < ChillerDragon> cring
21:31 < ChillerDragon> then take goresmaps.zip
21:31 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> teesmash underratrd
21:31 < ChillerDragon> put on ddnet maps discorc channel
21:31 < ChillerDragon> and submit
21:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
21:31 < bridge_> <_voxeldoesart> i wish ppl could play teesmash with me

21:33 < bridge_> <totar> atleast the strong

23:13 < bridge_> <gerdoe> old versions seem to write directly in game folder
23:45 < bridge_> <totar> it seems like they gave saved in the sqlite-wal file but I have no idea how you're meant to view those
