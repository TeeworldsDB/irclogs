16:00 < o_be_one> hi :)
16:05 <@deen> hi
16:09 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] timgame opened pull request #155: added tile -1 and updated grass automappers (DDRace64...DDRace64) http://git.io/xyJj
17:31 <@deen> That's where my weekend went: http://hookrace.net/blog/make-a-lisp-in-nim/
17:35 <@heinrich5991> that's nice :)
17:36 <@heinrich5991> the Rust implementation isn't performing good :/
17:39 <@deen> heinrich5991: and it's terrible to read with all the matches
17:39 <@deen> I'm wondering if this is idiomatic rust
17:40 <@deen> the MAL guy wrote the implementation in 24 languages himself during the last 12 months
17:40 <@heinrich5991> I wonder if it still compiles :P
17:40 <@deen> nope
17:40 <@deen> didn't for me
17:41 <@deen> actually most languages didn't compile for me, strangely...
17:41 <@heinrich5991> I kinda expected that
17:41 <@heinrich5991> (the Rust part)
17:41 <@deen> ruby because of 1.9 instead of 1.8
17:41 <@deen> python because of 3 instead of 2
17:41 <@deen> rust of course
17:41 <@deen> go because of 1.4 vs 1.3
17:41 <@heinrich5991> go not having backward-compatiblity?
17:41 <@heinrich5991> I'm disappointed
17:41 <@deen> apparently
17:42 <@heinrich5991> py2->3 is kinda expected
17:42 <@heinrich5991> you don't have py2 installed? :)
17:42 <@deen> I had to set python2 as my default temporarily :P
17:42 <@heinrich5991> what distro do you use?
17:42 <@deen> in the start python was even faster than nim, then i noticed that I did something stupid
17:42 <@deen> I'm on Gentoo
17:42 <@heinrich5991> ah :)
17:43 <@deen> I used stack data only, so I had to copy everything around all the time
17:43 <@deen> I would guess that rust does that as well ;)
17:43 <@heinrich5991> that was slow?
17:43 <@deen> putting it into the heap and choosinga fast garbage collector was 100 times faster
17:43 <@deen> copying around means copying around millions of times here
17:43 <@deen> yes
17:44 <@heinrich5991> mh.
17:44 <@heinrich5991> does nim have tagged unions btw?
17:45 <@deen> yes, but in another way
17:45 <@heinrich5991> other than C? other than Rust?
17:46 <@deen> both :P
17:46 <@heinrich5991> :)
17:46 <@deen> From functional programming and rust I only knew algebraic data types
17:46 <@heinrich5991> yea, that's kind of "safe tagged unions"
17:47 <@deen> Nim has object variants similar to the Pascal-family
17:47 <@deen> https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/nim/types.nim#L16-L29
17:47 <@heinrich5991> mh. I haven't encountered that in pascal
17:47 <@deen> I never wrote anything Pascal related except Nim, haha
17:48 <@heinrich5991> can you explain that syntax to me?
17:48 <@heinrich5991> of Number: number*: int
17:48 <@heinrich5991> Number is the variant
17:48 <@heinrich5991> int the type?
17:48 <@deen> it's a "case ... of" distinction
17:48 <@heinrich5991> and number *?
17:48 <@deen> every MalType object has a kind field of type MalKindType
17:48 <@deen> the * says it's exported, so you access it from other modules
17:49 <@heinrich5991> similar (!) to public: in c++?
17:49 <@deen> with the "of Number:" you say that the following members only exist if that kind == Number
17:49 <@deen> yes
17:50 <@heinrich5991> ah
17:50 <@heinrich5991> so kind of dependent types :)
17:50 <@deen> i don't think so
17:51 <@heinrich5991> mh.
17:51 <@heinrich5991> ok
17:52 <@deen> the #mal guys are crazy though
17:52 <@deen> the first lanuages they implemented it in were bash and make :P
17:52 <@heinrich5991> which network?
17:53 <@deen> they're on this network. but we're only 4 people there :P
17:53 <@deen> ehm
17:53 <@deen> freenode*
17:53 <@deen> forgot we're on quakenet here
18:03 <@heinrich5991> deen: was it fun to implement that? :)
18:03 <@heinrich5991> I guess so, right?
18:03 <@deen> Yeah, but writing Nim is always fun for me :P
18:05 <@heinrich5991> how did you obtain the benchmarks when things didn't even compile for you? ^^
18:06 <@deen> I asked the guy to make a benchmark, haha
18:06 <@deen> https://github.com/kanaka/mal/pull/20
18:06 <@deen> Nim does a lot better on his system than on mine too.
18:07 <@deen> :P
18:07 <@deen> the guide has many holes though
18:08 <@deen> And looking at the python implementation didn't always help me
18:08 <@deen> I actually looked at Rust a lot too, because that is much more explicit than Python
18:09 <@deen> Oh, and I remember reading hundreds of seemingly useless copy()s in the rust code
18:10 <@deen> afk
18:10 <@heinrich5991> what is copy?
18:10 <@heinrich5991> do you mean clone()?
18:16 < fstd> deen: are you running the TournDM server at 74.91.114.132:8243?
18:17 < fstd> hi everyone, too
18:18 <@heinrich5991> [18:10:02] <@deen> afk
18:18 <@heinrich5991> sorry, should have mentioned :)
18:39 <@deen> fstd: fstd yes
18:39 <@deen> -fstd
18:40 <@deen> that's DDNet USA
18:49 < fstd> ah, hi
18:49 < fstd> it's advertising itself as version "v0.6" in the serverinfo response packet, as opposed to just "0.6"; there are only three servers which misbehave in this regard, all of which seem to be older versions of TournDM, yours is one of them
18:49 < fstd> tourndm upstream seems to have fixed it with 7ea6d9aa1c11c70ba23f92dc9561d970594cb195
18:50 < fstd> would you mind fixing that on your instance, too? (GAME_VERSION in src/game/version.h)
18:51 <@deen> sure
18:51 < fstd> it probably doesn't matter for playing purposes, but it breaks compatibility with tools which rely on the version field to be the actual version discriminator
18:51 < fstd> thanks
18:51 <@deen> can't even remember setting that server up
18:52 < fstd> heh
18:53 <@deen> should be fixed
18:54 < fstd> ty
19:01 <@deen> laxa: your releases script doesn't work when the map has no special stuff below it here: http://ddnet.tw/releases/
19:02 < Nimda_5192> lost_castle by Shorefire just released on Brutal at 2015-03-04 18:56
19:02 <@heinrich5991> deen: ^^
19:03 <@deen> eh
19:03 <@deen> or it does work^^
19:03 <@deen> I'm just too impatient
20:01 < o_be_one> hey deen did u updated ddnet last time ? Someone used a bug to tell the ip of all users in chat and kick them with a weird reason ..
20:02 <@deen> o_be_one: "bug"
20:02 <@deen> i know they can do it
20:02 <@deen> it's a problem with the TW protocol
20:03 <@deen> and using non-ddnet client i guess (but not sure)
20:06 < eeeee> while we're working on a fix ddnet client users should be advised to avoid using the regular serverbrowser
20:07 < o_be_one> hum you mean its same bug than before ?
20:07 < eeeee> not sure what is the "before" one
20:08 < eeeee> but this issue was kind of known forever, yet people have been working on ephemerial 0.7 instead of fixing it :/
20:08 < eeeee> s/forever/for a while/
20:09 <@deen> eeeee: I'm not sure I want to advise that to the regular players. I only see this problem on a single block server so far. I'm afraid if we give it attention, they'll actually start kicking people from all servers
20:09 < eeeee> yeah that's fine then
20:10 <@deen> last time I came to the block server and complained they started ddosing :P
20:11 < eeeee> lol why would you even bother complaining :D
20:13 <@deen> complaining / asking around
20:13 <@deen> they don't like me coming to the block server i guess :P
21:52 < Spyker> hi all!
21:52 < Spyker> deen?
21:54 <@deen> hi Spyker !!!!
22:04 < Spyker> deen, i have an interesting purpose for you :D
22:04 <@deen> go on?
22:05 < Spyker> if you want, i can make trailer of tournament maps! ofc i dont play tournament and dont speak about map
22:05 < Spyker> just 1 min trailer with edit, effect and 3-4 parts
22:06 < Spyker> in this days i have time and i can record without stupid ban
22:06 < Spyker> and i have now sony vegas, so easy and pro edit!
22:06 <@deen> Have you talked to Aoe about that?
22:07 <@deen> It's his map so he can decide that kind of stuff
22:07 < Spyker> nono, i didnt talked
22:07 <@deen> I don't mind either way, I'm not against it
22:07 <@deen> I would post it on ddnet.tw if Aoe says ok and the video is nice
22:08 < Spyker> man, but maybe for the next tournament, because if i play the parts aoe want and do video, edit and upload, it will take 4-5h
22:08 < Spyker> and ppl will see video 1 day before tournament
22:08 < Spyker> it dont make sense because no time for hype
22:09 < Spyker> for the next tournament i will ask mapper for trailer, i just want your ok! because i know tournament maps are secret :P
22:10 <@deen> Everything is ok for me
22:10 <@deen> The mappers can show the map to whoever they want, those people just can't play in tournament :P
22:14 < Spyker> i will just show 3-4 parts of all map!
22:14 < Spyker> with edit and strange effect
22:14 < Spyker> none will understend ahaha
22:15 < Spyker> where can i write it? in official server?
22:15 <@deen> write what?
22:18 < Spyker> the post for mappers, if they want to relase a map with trailer
22:18 < Spyker> i will do it for tournament and normal maps if ppl want
22:18 < Spyker> to
22:19 <@deen> you can write in forum or talk to the mappers themselves i guess
22:19 < Spyker> i will write on forum, but where? xD
22:19 <@deen> mapping section
22:19 < Spyker> oka
