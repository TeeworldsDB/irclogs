05:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh i had a really cool idea earlier
05:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> have the ability to change things based on system time, so you could have an entities bg that's darker at night, and a sunny one for the day :D
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sounds too lame compared to other stuff worth coding though
09:02 <+ChillerDragon> @c0d3d3v could you provide me with some detail what you tried? Which map did you open what did you press?
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> we could add it to the race sound option if the gun sound is not important on that server
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I did try some maps, first oco, then a other map and then ctf5 or so. And just pressed CTR+Left click on some tiles, and selected some layers manuelly to see if the left click chaneges something
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I try it again
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I did try some maps, first oco, then Mult0map and then ctf5 or so. And just pressed CTR+Left click on some tiles, and selected some layers manuelly to see if the left click chaneges something
10:09 <+ChillerDragon> hmm weird i can not reproduce. I also tried oco. Selected a single and multiple layers. But then when using left click on a tile in the map while holding ctrl it always updates the selected layer.
10:09 <+ChillerDragon> Can anyone else reproduce this?
10:10 <+ChillerDragon> I tried on two devices
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 'I pressed rapidly ctr+left click, and also some slow clicks
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/962988471142735932/mapping2-2022-04-11_10.08.21.mp4
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I make some qick debugging, and look if the code gets triggert at all
10:22 <+ChillerDragon> nice thanks
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> s_CtrlClick was always false for me, I do not see how this should even get true, since it is returned before
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/962991657253486592/unknown.png
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD I was dump, wait a minute
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD I was dumb, wait a minute
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> lol now it works, but not on ctrl+left click. It works on ctrl+right click
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Did you intended it to work on right click?
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> for what do you even need s_CtrlClick? Is it only in case you want to make a other funktion on Ctrl+Click?
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> nvm
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Maybe we could split the editor into several files at some day xD 6500 lines sounds like you could split it into logical parts.
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Maybe we could split the editor into several files at some day xD 6500 lines sounds like you could split it into logical parts. (however, i have not worked on the editor yet, so i don't know how bad the situation really is)
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ChillerDragon will you take care of the fix?
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> or does it for you work on left click xD
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Any news about teeditor?
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Have you tested it?
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Wohoo> Some good features could be imported in default editor
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> ah shit yea omg im a idiot i confused left and right :D i wanted to do left initially then i noticed it is kinda conflicting
11:25 <+ChillerDragon> @c0d3d3v good catch thanks i will fix it haha
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> thats why i couldnt reproduce haha
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/4653
11:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> this seems to be fixed, in latest master. But I do not know with what commit
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> does someone knows the reason why we use for m_aCharacters[i].m_prev / m_Cur / m_ExtendedData  copies 
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> see: https://github.com/C0D3D3V/ddnet/blob/dbd9c40893a18dccb7f70f0e2bb77c4384877973/src/game/client/gameclient.h#L315-L318
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but for the other snaps pointers see: 
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://github.com/C0D3D3V/ddnet/blob/dbd9c40893a18dccb7f70f0e2bb77c4384877973/src/game/client/gameclient.h#L280-L294
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> m_Prev and m_Cur are the snapshots of the character from now and the snapshot before
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> while m_ExtendedData holds information from the DDNetCharacter netobject, it tells more specific information about the character like the weapons it has, whether its in super, collision, hook on/off, freezetime, etc
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah, i see lol. Its simply because the character is the most important snap object probably so it got its own struct with all information together
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> What can be the reason for this
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/963077120333062164/screenshot_2022-04-10_23-36-25.png
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> I am actually connected to the server but it doesn't render the map
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> I get stuck in the menu
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> Btw the client is edited and I changed it's version.h a little bit
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> Like the net version
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1649687323.png
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> Who recognizes Multimap? :D
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD you are funny ðŸ˜„ changing the version and want magic support :DD maybe your version gets detected as 0.7 and you are getting 0.7 packages
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> no it's 0.6 lol
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> That has to be done
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> Server has an anti-client
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> you should not be able to join without their client
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> I'm faking it somehow
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> do you have your changes online?
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> No
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> don't help botters
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> :thonk:
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> I'm not botter lol
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you are
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> How do you know
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> I have never botted in ddnet :/
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> im not a botter > I have never botted on ddnet
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> I meant on the official servers
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD use there client... I think they changed the network packages, so our client will not work without major reconstruction
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/963089350000771103/unknown.png
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> No their owner is an asshole lol
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> He's too lazy for this
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> send me a link to there client download page please ðŸ˜„ I want to see what network packages they have changed
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> I could bypass this message by changing a few versions
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We reverse engineered this client a while back and the version we looked at at least didn't on the surface have anything malicious in it
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bypassing it isn't too too hard indeed but ddnet is open source so if we let our client join their server, we'd also be exposing how they do the check
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD yes I also just looked into it a little bit, but makes not much fun without debugging symbols, and I also do not have interests in it ðŸ˜„ xD
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i think thats just their way of avoiding bots
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> without antibot, i mean
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> definitly dont use their client
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD I would also not use there client
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I would also not use there servers
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> their*
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> jj
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eventhough I'm fairly certain there wasnt anything nefarious in the version we checked, I'd still suggest you don't use it aswell
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> is it just me or does /mapinfo not work anymore?
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> yea same here
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> only doesnt work on mult0map
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> only doesnt work on mult0map for me
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> for me it works nowhere
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> that was a lie
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> it does work sometimes
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> but not always
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> one reason is the dead reckoning / "Evolve()" calls. other snapshot items are always up to date in the latest snapshot (and can be used directly), but the character might not be
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro could you update trashmap ddnet version to support live freeze?
