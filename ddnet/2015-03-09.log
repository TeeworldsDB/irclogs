13:53 < o_be_one> hi :)
15:36 < xRoThx> Hello, There is a pretty big problem with the mod. deen  said I should explain it here. 
15:36 <@deen> Yep, maybe someone has good ideas or wants to fix it
15:37 < xRoThx> Its about flooding. When two players are flooding from two clients (different ip's) the server is lagging very hard
15:37 < xRoThx> there is no flood protection ingame I think
15:38 < xRoThx> @ the candys servers you get banned for 5 minutes for flooding
15:38 < xRoThx> ddnet hasn't, anyone an idea how to fix it?
