00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well i guess its the new fucking zsh or what i messed with my terminal cuz it crashes on opening terminal
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is anyone of u using the linux subsystems for windows?
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its super weird to run exe files in a somewhat linuxy enviroment
08:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol, imagine blaming a terminal for an entire OS crashing
08:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Shell*
10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Every time I started my terminal my os crashed. Then I sshâ€˜d into it and removed the empty line in my .zshrc and it worked fine again ^^
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Imagine it being actually a macOS crasher 0d :troll:
12:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Oh hm my mysql linking for ddnet7 seems to be broken any ideas what could cause this error? http://149.202.127.134:8080/Te
13:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ok solved it dependency order is key
14:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen could you please activate circleci for pullrequests in ddnet7 ðŸ™‚
14:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or activate it in gernal i think its off since the repo got deleted

15:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh btw guys
15:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet7 now has working mysql support
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon great, thanks a lot for working on that!
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ™‚
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I had it on my todo list but didn't get around to it :/
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> is only circleci missing or also the other ci stuff?
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think all ci stuff but im only a circle dude so idunno much about the others
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon what branch r u using? master od d7
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> master
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its not clean
18:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i wait for greenlight from learath on d7
19:06 <@deen> not sure what's wrong with the circleci
19:06 <@deen> or how to reset it
19:08 <@deen> travis and circle seem to be doing something
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm :/
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo deen do we need /save for 0.7 test server?
20:47 <@deen> oh, I just discovered that github has a restore button for deleted repos
20:47 <@deen> that probably wouldn't have confused circleci
20:51 <@deen> I don't think /save is that important for test
20:59 <+Ryozuki> discord not working, but irc is always reliable :D
21:10 <@deen> oh, I thought it was just me
21:10 <+Learath2> no, discord is indeed having some trouble
21:12 <+Ryozuki> cuz google cloud issue with ssd
21:12 <+Ryozuki> https://status.discordapp.com/
22:19 <+bridge_> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> well irc it is then
22:20 <+bridge_> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> so are we ready to launch some 0.7 servers now? Is anyone doing it? :)
23:28 <@deen> i could set some up if the admins are ok with it
23:31 <@deen> I see circleci building something, yay: https://circleci.com/gh/ddnet/ddnet7/33
