00:01 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> i assume that crashing the client doesnt count as something like that unless it could be used for rce?
00:08 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, there are various crashes if the connecting process doesn't go according to plan, but unless it's a OOB write or stack overflow it's probably already known
00:08 < bridge> <robyt3> and if a server owner wanted to crash a client they could just send an invalid map
00:09 < bridge> <robyt3> crashing a client without it even connecting would be pretty bad though
00:11 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> yea exsactly
00:12 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> though unless the master server sends invalid data i have 0 clue how you would crash the client without it even connecting
03:07 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> sorry but this is probaly a dumb quston as i baraly know c++ but why is  Kernel() defined here but not here?

03:14 < bridge> <totar> kernel.h is not included anywhere in the include path for that file, but it should work if you add it I think
03:15 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> i already tried that
03:15 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1341231473923194912/image.png?ex=67b53ea6&is=67b3ed26&hm=b76274faba9c932b09fd24aa8b80ad0a1c3729eba3792a0aeaa6c65ef734f85f&
03:15 < bridge> <totar> ``#include "kernel.h"``
03:15 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> in the image its there
03:15 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> oh put it in ""s ok
03:15 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> whats the difrence?
03:16 < bridge> <totar> doing <kernal.h> will only work if it's in the same folder as you file you wrote that in
03:16 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ah ok
03:17 < bridge> <totar> ``#include <engine/kernel.h>`` should also work
03:17 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> good as putting it in ""s didnt
03:17 < bridge> <totar> yeah it doesn't make any difference in this case
03:18 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> still not working it seems

03:19 < bridge> <totar> idk just use the first one then
03:19 < bridge> <totar> I don't have an editor open to figure out what the path should be
03:19 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> that also doesnt work though
03:19 < bridge> <totar> hmm
03:20 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> wait do i need to put it in the .h file too?
03:20 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> wait where is the .h file???
03:21 < bridge> <totar> network.h
03:21 < bridge> <totar> idk why it doesn't work
03:21 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ah ok
03:25 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ok looks like ill just have to use io_open() drectly
03:30 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> burh you literaly have system.sh already included!

03:31 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> is vscode just being stupid?
03:32 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> i mean ig theres only one way to find out. its compileing time!
03:35 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> wait a second its because there is no storage.h file
03:35 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> but then how in the world would i refrence it
03:37 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ok no its not just vscode being dumb it realy doesnt work
03:52 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> i am so confused
05:08 < bridge> <louis> maybe its wsl shenanigans
07:53 < bridge> <teero777> tldr what happened
07:54 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> im trying to call a funcson from a dif file but i cant get it to work
07:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is there any setting which gives pistol bullets gravity?
07:54 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> and idk why
07:55 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> also wow did both of you suddenly appear at once?
07:55 < bridge> <teero777> yes
07:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> which one? xd
07:56 < bridge> <teero777> gun curvature or smth
07:56 < bridge> <teero777> Check ddnet settings commands page
07:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> there's `gun_curvature`, thanks, `curvature` is not the word I was looking for xd
07:57 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> so does anyone know what stupid mastake im making? https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1341229474657599520
08:00 < bridge> <teero777> hmm is there a pointer to the client I network.h? You might be able to get a reference to the over some other pointer within CNetClient. I'm home in 7 hours if you still need help then. GitHub code browsing is shit on mobile

08:03 < bridge> <teero777> @totar can u check for me what CNetClient::m_pUser is set to? xd
08:03 < bridge> <teero777> ah fk
08:03 < bridge> <totar> what
08:03 < bridge> <teero777> wrong thing wait
08:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> TIL https://github.com/gentoo-mirror/pentoo
09:01 < bridge> <pioooooo> Is CNetClient subclass of Interface?
09:17 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> if the .h file for network is where that would be then no
09:18 < bridge> <pioooooo> Oops I mean IInterface
09:19 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> doesnt look like it
09:19 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1341323149073055764/image.png?ex=67b59407&is=67b44287&hm=2536d7e6fbcb95f23d4c11a5cda409314777e01706970c27893ba4ea76a15f72&
09:19 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> why?
09:19 < bridge> <pioooooo> Because it isn't
09:20 < bridge> <pioooooo> :gigachad:
09:20 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> wait so how does the fact that it doesnt inherit from IInterface help me open a file?
09:22 < bridge> <pioooooo> Idk u asked why Kernel is not defined and this is why
09:22 < bridge> <pioooooo> Because it is a member function of IInterface
09:22 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ah hmm so how would i refrence it then (agien c++ noob here)
09:25 < bridge> <pioooooo> Idk maybe u shouldn't use it  here if u just want to open some random file for fuzzing
09:25 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> true
09:25 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ill just look up how to open a file in c++ the normal way lol
09:31 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> also before i go to sleep in advance does anyone know what funcson gets called when the client disconects from the server? as i want to exit the program if that happens for fuzzing
09:36 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> bruh not even the normal way of opening files works??? im including the needed namespaces i thought

09:40 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> frogot thats how you acsess the meathod of a class in c++
09:40 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> or was it namespace
09:40 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> idr
09:41 < bridge> <pioooooo> It's a namespace
09:43 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ok now to figger out why this isnt working and what the real way to do it is thats not in all of the exsamples i can find online

20:38 < bridge> <nameless_me> isht bein sheinzer
20:38 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Anyways, how is KoG2.0 doing? (legit question)
20:39 < bridge> <avolicious> Already released 😮
20:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Ah lol
20:39 < bridge> <nameless_me> dos shnitzal
20:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I recently saw a map with a kog 2.0 soon 💀 text
20:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thats why
20:39 < bridge> <avolicious> yeah, haters gonna hate
20:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xD
20:39 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I think it was ring of gores or square of gores
20:41 < bridge> <nameless_me> what is Kog2.0?
20:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Discord mobile is so weird, in some places they render discord emoji and the system emoji in others
20:41 < bridge> <fokkonaut> updated kog
20:42 < bridge> <nameless_me> so, just, kog? How is it diffrent?
20:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i think it's the new source + login system etc
20:42 < bridge> <avolicious> new game basically
20:42 < bridge> <fokkonaut> + fucking /save and /swap disabled 😠
20:42 < bridge> <avolicious> built with unreal engine

23:23 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> for fuzzing the networking is it fine to just ignore the clients packets or do any of them contain info that i need to send pack to the client
23:24 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> and is there any more checksums then the maps checksums
23:27 < bridge> <robyt3> Some of those sent during the connecting process are necessary or the process won't advance. I'd maybe do separate runs for the connecting process and ingame, where you start the fuzzing a bit later.
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> hey awesome
23:29 < bridge> <Ewan> this is exactly what i need
23:30 < bridge> <Ewan> some SaaS  we use provides us with an OpenAPI doc that it does not adhere to and the types we use types generate out of that doc
23:30 < bridge> <Ewan> we had a random error where one field they marked as non-optional but provided us with null and serde sent the whole thing crashing xd
23:30 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> is that for the checksums or the clients packets
23:31 < bridge> <Ewan> some SaaS  we use provides us with an OpenAPI doc that it does not adhere to and the types we use are generated from that doc
23:31 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> is that for the checksums or ignoreing the  clients packets
23:31 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> is that for the checksums or ignoreing the clients packets
23:32 < bridge> <robyt3> Both. If the checksums in the map info don't match the map then the client will disconnect. If the client doesn't get some messages it will stop during the connecting process.
23:33 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ok but the messages the client needs to receve dont depend on what the client sends the server right?
23:33 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> the fuzzing can figger out what messages to send to connect
23:37 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess if the fuzzer is smart enough then that's alright. It goes back and forth during connecting, the client sends ready after loading the map, then the server sends back ready so the client joins
23:37 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> oh ok so if the server sends ready before the client it wouldnt work
23:37 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> oh ok so if the server sends ready before the client it wouldnt work?
23:39 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> so in outer words i cant just send all the packets in 1 frame
23:39 < bridge> <robyt3> The client should ignore messages when it doesn't expect them so connection wouldn't work, but there are also still crashes (and various open issues) because it doesn't ignore all.
23:40 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, the client couldn't respond fast enough
23:40 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> how long should i delay each packet do you think
23:41 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't know if delaying work. I only tried a bit of network fuzzing where I mutated the exiting message data but didn't generate new messages directly.
23:41 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't know if delaying works. I only tried a bit of network fuzzing where I mutated the exiting message data but didn't generate new messages directly.

23:42 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ok well ill at least try
23:42 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> btw where is the servers code so i can make it send 1 packet each frame?
23:43 < bridge> <robyt3> probably not, writing a fuzzing test driver is probably the first challenge
23:44 < bridge> <robyt3> unless you go use the easier method of only mutating existing data, but I don't know if that works with AFL++, and it wasn't very effective with radamsa
23:44 < bridge> <robyt3> unless you use the easier method of only mutating existing data, but I don't know if that works with AFL++, and it wasn't very effective with radamsa
23:44 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> yea hence why im trying this meatod
23:44 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> instead
23:47 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> so do you know where the servers code is?
23:47 < bridge> <robyt3> You mean networking?
23:47 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> yea
23:47 < bridge> <robyt3> `src/engine/shared/network*`
23:48 < bridge> <robyt3> and basic functions for interacting with sockets in `system.cpp/h`
23:48 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ok thanks
23:48 < bridge> <robyt3> depends on the abstraction layer where you want to start fuzzing
23:49 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> im currently pretending like you got completly difrent packets on the client side then the server sends
23:49 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> by editing CNetClient::Recv
23:49 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> wait is that used by the server too?
23:49 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> probs not
23:49 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> given the name has Client in it
23:50 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> also whats "NETMSG_CHECKSUM_REQUEST"
23:51 < bridge> <robyt3> It's a checksum of client data, shouldn't really be relevant for fuzzing
23:51 < bridge> <davidlovesmath> ok good to know
