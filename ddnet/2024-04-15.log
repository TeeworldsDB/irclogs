03:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> omg maybe languages should get a feature where you can just include a file as a string or format.
03:53 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i would love that
03:54 < bridge> <TsFreddie> better, without the need to escape quotes or something, it would just be a string.
03:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
03:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> templating be like
03:55 < bridge> <headshotnoby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1229248577528664084/image.png?ex=662efdf3&is=661c88f3&hm=2a5657788b17ca409e3d86340ad84f4449cbcf6e82e606f27c1d422ab354267a&
03:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> bruh
03:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what are you doing
03:55 < bridge> <headshotnoby> porting ddnet to every stinkin nintendo console
03:55 < bridge> <TsFreddie> are there even wiis in Venezuela
03:55 < bridge> <headshotnoby> yes i had a wii when i was a kid many years ago
04:02 < bridge> <TsFreddie> not many people can be confident porting native codes to consoles.
04:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I had to port some native libraries our last company uses for PS5 and switch, no one know how to do it in-house, and they reached out to library devs and they couldn't do it too. I just did it in an afternoon and quit the job.:owo:
04:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> it feels cool
04:03 < bridge> <TsFreddie> nothing graphical tho
04:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> just some scripting engine they were using
05:30 < bridge> <mazty> do u used iterator for "it"
05:30 < bridge> <mazty> ?
05:30 < bridge> <headshotnoby> yes
05:31 < bridge> <mazty> Not needed use auto for it?
05:31 < bridge> <headshotnoby> you can either use auto or the iterator type name
05:31 < bridge> <headshotnoby> auto is shorter
05:31 < bridge> <mazty> Example auto Collision = m_pClient->Collision;
05:31 < bridge> <mazty> Ah
05:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> pro
05:38 < bridge> <headshotnoby> :feelsamazingman:
05:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> had a day off after like 20 days
05:41 < bridge> <TsFreddie> feeling worse than before
06:23 < bridge> <Ewan> are u doing anything
06:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I have many 2-4 lines like dat, should i create separate files for each piece of asm?
06:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @ar1gin what u think
06:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i slept through sunday
06:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> closed my eyes saturday night, wake up it is monday morning again
06:58 < bridge> <Ewan> ouch
06:58 < bridge> <Ewan> i think u should still try to get up moderately early on days off
06:58 < bridge> <Ewan> 10 am latest
06:58 < bridge> <Ewan> it's not rewarding when u sleep as long as you can and you waste the best part of your day
07:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what was the issue?
07:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with network
07:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> ye but i havent slept for like 40hrs
07:30 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and i got home saturday night at like 4am (so sunday morning
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> damn
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> Yeah maybe noon
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> or 1 pm
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> but the day seems over by then
07:34 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i need to quit my job asap
07:37 < bridge> <Ewan> why have this attitude
07:37 < bridge> <Ewan> just work less
07:37 < bridge> <Ewan> push deadlines and give yourself time to breathe
07:37 < bridge> <Ewan> sounds like you have some kind of mania if ur working working working to the point of being this tired
07:38 < bridge> <Ewan> and if ur boss won’t let you then fine, fuck the job but I would not go straight there
07:39 < bridge> <Ewan> u come in here and post the same thing expecting different responses than what u already knew before posting
07:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i'm not the one pushing it
07:40 < bridge> <Ewan> did u talk to boss
07:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also i was gonna quit anyway
07:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i already told them i quit, if they really need me then they need to prove it
07:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I couldn't care less about job security so they either let me go, fix their management or let me manage my own team.
07:43 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
07:48 < bridge> <0xdeen> Big decision!
07:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274>
07:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> I think I'm in a position that company really needs me. since both of my two job seems to be throwing me into tech lead position without explicitly giving me a lead role
07:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> which is kinda weird but also kinda epic
07:56 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but it's about time to change that
07:57 < bridge> <teero777> epyc
07:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:amogus:876956004674338848> three years of work exp straight into lead role would be epic
07:57 < bridge> <TsFreddie> but failing that, I would just open my own studio cuz everyone sucks at making video games
08:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning from gym
08:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would say its more mismanagement, i also kinda thought that till i landed where i am
08:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> imho u need more xp for tech leas
08:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> lead
08:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> but ye indeed if u have a edge over company push it for better
08:35 < bridge> <TsFreddie> where you at now
08:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> i would say im the thing after junior
08:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> but with strong technical skills
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> in fact, i proba have more tech skills than  my manager who is tech least
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> lead
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but he knows more about other stuff
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> managing time, difficulties, expectations, not letting juniors add useless stuff, focusing on the real stuff
08:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> pushing us to add more docs xd
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> and well he has like native english he also deals with some clients
08:38 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean ye
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> well, with the clients tech lead/ manager
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> he has like 15y xp
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> are u good dealing with ppl?
08:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> are you managing a team of three plus deciding the tech stack plus building the scaffold from scratch
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i kinda did
08:39 < bridge> <TsFreddie> oof
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok i didn't
08:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> he tech lead managed us
08:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> then i guess i'm not worthy yet.
08:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i lead
08:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> the project from scratch
08:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i lead 2 in fact
08:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> the 2 compiler related projects
08:40 < bridge> <TsFreddie> **shaking in gamedev**
08:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> like the core dev i meam
08:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> mean
08:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> god mobile
08:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> and shaky arm cuz gym
08:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> these two I've worked for just called me to join
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> u dont have chinese linkedin?
08:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> microsoft closed it
08:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> we use other platform
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> we should make ddnet game studio
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> good devs here
08:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and I did looked for jobs
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i do backend with rust
08:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> wasn't good at it
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
08:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> also I don't feel like doing software cuz it'd be grinding from the bottom all over again since I have mostly gamedev exp
08:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> gamedev is just not where the moneys at rn
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> ig
08:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i mean it is where the moneys at, but not for employees
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
08:49 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i guess usually gamedev studios here are just really small sized where two or three people do basically all the core work
08:57 < bridge> <teero777> Gotta reach lvl 30 to enchant the workers kekw
08:59 < bridge> <0xdeen> Gamedev being stressful sounds like an industry wide problem, one of the reasons I didn't want to work in that area.
09:00 < bridge> <0xdeen> I don't think that's true necessarily
09:01 < bridge> <0xdeen> Starting your own company is probably even more stressful though, but at least you get returns if it's successful
09:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :justatest: i think i just suck at interviews
09:03 < bridge> <0xdeen> There are some good Chinese database companies
09:04 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> i'm also not sure if I want to not do gamedevs tho
09:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> any database company is a red flag in this world, regardless where it is
09:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Better to do your own, but who am I kidding, as a casual google drive user
09:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur comments sometimes are so out of touch
09:06 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And you love it :owo:
09:06 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I keep you all entertained
09:06 < bridge> <0xdeen> I was thinking of https://github.com/pingcap/tidb but somehow PingCap doesn't seem Chinese? https://www.pingcap.com/careers/ Maybe I confused something
09:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> yugabyte and materialize are quite famous
09:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> i had coworkers send me articles
09:07 < bridge> <0xdeen> > Its open-source distributed database provides compatibility and enables users to build applications. The company was founded in 2015 and is based in Beijing, China.
09:07 < bridge> <0xdeen> Cool. That reminds me that I still have my blog article half-finished, should continue on that
09:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> I also need to write more about llvm and mlir
09:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> <a:nekospin:1039804721378111548>
09:16 < bridge> <teero777> Btw why do you write blogs?
09:17 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i think i'm just scared of software dev
09:18 < bridge> <TsFreddie> feel like software dev are more technical than gamedev. and I can feel like I'm the most technical person on a gamedev team. that's a me problem for sure tho
09:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> u learn more, u learn how to explain which makes u understand more, it also allows u to show ur knowledge and build reputation either for general stuff or to find jobs, also cuz it genuinely helps some ppl specially for niche stuff
09:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is barely blogs about mlir and llvm
09:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> all deva who like what they do should write
09:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> all devs who like what they do should write
09:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> It feel like everytime I want to do anything productive then a crunch hits
09:28 < bridge> <TsFreddie> and I don't want to do anything afterwards
09:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://yorickpeterse.com/articles/how-to-write-a-code-formatter/
09:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> that too
09:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can also make a blog post about why u blog post
09:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> inception

11:18 < bridge> <learath2> Eh, doesn't look too bad
11:19 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It works for just string literals but i can't format string there

12:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 is it UB to pass size 0 to realloc?
13:01 < bridge> <reitw> Apparently it's not
13:12 < bridge> <Peakies> is it possible to compile DDNet 18.1 for android release ?
13:19 < bridge> <reitw> I think ddnet doesn't support android anymore
13:19 < bridge> <reitw> It was discontinued
13:28 < bridge> <Peakies> hmm tnx 🤝
13:47 < bridge> <furo> It is or at least should be possible to compile for. See the README in scripts/android. But the touch screen controls found in the older APKs are no longer supported.
14:01 < bridge> <Peakies> I'll check it ty
14:03 < bridge> <learath2> I totally missed this
14:09 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :owo:
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> looks like its ub from c23 onwards

17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
17:53 < bridge> <learath2> Today I've encountered a tool that parses the command line output of docker to determine stuff. It breaks for podman because capital letters and stuff
17:53 < bridge> <learath2> Idk what it is with modern applications and an allergy to do things properly
17:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt docker has a json output
17:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt docker have a json output
17:55 < bridge> <learath2> For some things it does. Truly every part of modern programming is baffling
17:58 < bridge> <learath2> It does for this too actually. So no reason for them not to parse it properly instead of relying on the exact format of the message on stderr
17:59 < bridge> <nouaa> nice tee btw
18:02 < bridge> <learath2> It also relies on the absurd behaviour by docker to add leading slashes to their container names internally
19:10 < bridge> <louis> what's wrong with json
19:10 < bridge> <egyt> not entirely libre?
19:12 < bridge> <louis> huh xd
19:45 < bridge> <learath2> Nothing, it’s great at what it is
