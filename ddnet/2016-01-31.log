19:16 < Shereef> Hey guys
19:17 < Shereef> Learath2: U there ?
19:20 < Shereef> This is GreYFoX had some free time to kill wante to play a game but i wasted like 10 mins trying to get the client resolution to work full screen but the screen is always trimmed and then when i went to windowed 1024*768 the mouse keeps flying on me when I move right and stop it keeps going right for some reason this is ddnet 9.1 x64
19:21 < Shereef> win64
19:23 <@deen> hi Shereef 
19:23 <@deen> Shereef: that sounds strange, how are you setting it?
19:24 <@deen> because we use settings_ddnet.cfg, not settings.cfg
19:25 < Shereef> using console
19:26 < Shereef> anyways the vanilla client has the same issues
19:26 < Shereef> too
19:26 < Shereef> but ddnet client has 1issue
19:26 < Shereef> that is breaking it for me
19:26 < Shereef> with or without antiping
19:26 < Shereef> i get 1000 ping whenever i join any server
19:26 < Shereef> but on vanilla i join fine
19:28 <@deen> that's strange
19:28 <@deen> the only difference there is that ddnet client uses a random port for connections
19:28 <@deen> and vanilla does not
19:28 <@deen> (this was necessary because of DoS attacks on clients)
19:29 < Shereef> strange

19:31 <@deen> very strange, never heard of both of these issues
19:32 <@deen> we have a tournament in 30 min btw
19:32 < Shereef> and that was the end of my free time today, i just got a baby (Adam) my wife gave birth a week ago, afk
19:32 < Shereef> he is crying
19:35 <@deen> congratulations on the baby
19:35 < Shereef> I'm back, she has him now ^_^
19:35 < Shereef> thanks deen ^_^
19:36 < Shereef> I like the timeout protection
19:36 < Shereef> smart idea
19:36 < Shereef> to give the client a token he can reconnect with
19:37 < Shereef> Good luck with your tournament 
19:37 <@deen> thanks, we'll see
19:37 <@deen> usually they get DDoSed hard
19:38 < Shereef> I'm out will go find something else to do since tw is not working for me
19:38 < Shereef> LOL why ?
19:38 < Shereef> DDoS the servers ? or players, or both ?
19:38 <@deen> we get DDoSed all the time, but during tournaments it's worst
19:38 <@deen> mostly servers, also streamers, myself personally, sometimes players
19:39 < Shereef> you have a static IP ?
19:39 <@deen> no
19:39 < Shereef> how do they find your IP ?
19:39 <@deen> skype i guess
19:39 < Shereef> Skype only sends it to friends I think
19:39 < Shereef> my advice restart your router after quitting skye
19:39 < Shereef> skype
19:40 <@deen> yeah, i have solutions in place
19:50 < Shereef> I figured out the bugs
19:50 < Shereef> my resolution is 1920x .....
19:51 < Shereef> windows have a text enlarge opton
19:51 < Shereef> 125% enlargement
19:51 < Shereef> when i turned it off
19:51 < Shereef> it worked fine
19:51 <@deen> ah, interesting
