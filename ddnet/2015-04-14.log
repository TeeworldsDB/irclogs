00:06 < Spyker> Deen, I think you can put it on ddnet Page if you want :) 
07:41 < Boroda> Hello 
07:41 < Boroda> help please
16:51 < laxadedi>         public static int MonthDifference(DateTime rValue)
16:51 < laxadedi>         {
16:51 < laxadedi>             return (DateTime.Now.Month - rValue.Month) + 12 * (DateTime.Now.Year - rValue.Year);
16:51 < laxadedi>         }
16:51 < laxadedi> And yes, I am working with people doing this kind of code
17:06 < Learath2> laxadedi: looks perfectly fine to me 
17:08 < fstd> -_-
17:08 < laxadedi> Yes it is in fact
17:09 < laxadedi> the code was on StackOverflow xD
17:11 <@deen> Woah, Harmony Hosting has been running fine for 3 months, that's far longer than ever before
19:53 <@deen> XXLTomate: is that you on zcatch?
20:16 < eeeee> this is the best thing i ever found on stackoverflow http://stackoverflow.com/a/24121361
20:26 <@deen> js is weird
20:29 < eeeee> yeah it's really bad. no typing, no classes, no generics, and quirks like (0 == null || 0 > null) != (0 >= null)
20:32 < fstd> the snippet below that is pretty, uh, interesting, too
20:34 < fstd> that the de-facto industry standard nan/inf-check in js?
20:37 <@deen> there are many interesting things on this page
20:37 <@deen> regular expressions?
20:37 <@deen> (a * 0) == 0?
20:38 < fstd> the latter was what i'm referring to, yeah
20:38 < fstd> it must be a check for nan or inf or whatever magic values js has available, in order to make at least a bit of sense
20:38 < eeeee> but the question was how to check if char is a digit, (a * 0) == 0 checks if 'a' is number-like
20:39 < fstd> who reads the question anyway?
20:39 < fstd> it's the answers that matter!
20:40 < eeeee> also null * 0 == 0
20:40 < fstd> but null != 0? :S
20:41 < eeeee> well at least null >= 0 && null <= 0 ;D
20:42 < fstd> if only someone would nuke the entire www from orbit.
20:42 < eeeee> fear not, i have a fix
20:43 < fstd> s/fi/ha/
20:43 < eeeee> you just do ('' + a) * 0 == 0
20:43 < eeeee> '' + null == 'null'
20:43 < eeeee> :D
20:43 < fstd> well that's totally logical
20:45 < fstd> i hear vim has a special js-optimizer built-in, it's invoked by :%s/^.*$\n//
20:45 < fstd> and conveniently mapped to 1GdG for the lazy
21:23 < Learath2> eeeee: is null == null ?
22:30 < eeeee> yea ofc
22:35 < fstd> but is not commutative
22:35 < fstd> null == null, but null != null
23:08 < Learath2> thats confusing...
23:09 < Learath2> null equals null but null also doesnt equal null
23:10 < Learath2> null is in a quantum superstate
23:17 < fstd> don't you dare kill the cat
23:19  * Learath2 observes the cat
23:20 < fstd> D:
23:20 < Learath2> !decide cat is alive or cat is dead
23:20 < Nimda> Learath2: cat is dead
23:20 < fstd> that cat is a lie
23:21 < fstd> s/that/the/
23:22 < Learath2> but if the cat is a lie can it be in a superstate ?
23:23 < fstd> sure, all implications are true, given a false premiss, and what's more false than a lie?
23:24 < ochristi> meh cat, dog! http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/gutsy/man1/dog.1.html
23:25 < Learath2> a paradox obv
23:25 < fstd> not a paradog?
23:26 < Learath2> not a singular paradog we are talking about paradogs here
