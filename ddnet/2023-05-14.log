01:12 < bridge> <kio> error because gameclient and curl are in conflit or something like, can i use http library in the project to do a Sync request?
01:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can't really do a sync request from that code
01:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it'd mean the client freezes until then
02:25 < bridge> <ReiTW> ```
02:25 < bridge> <ReiTW> 2023-05-14 00:24:35 I assert: /ddnet-source/src/engine/server/register.cpp(517): curl version < 7.77.0 does not support registering via both IPv4 and IPv6, set `sv_register ipv6` or `sv_register ipv4`
02:25 < bridge> <ReiTW> Illegal instruction
02:25 < bridge> <ReiTW> ```
02:25 < bridge> <ReiTW> what's that
02:25 < bridge> <ReiTW> funny curl doesn't allow that since
08:24 <+ChillerDragon> hm how do computers work i get a weird glitchy vertical line while playing teeworlds or any game in windowed or fullscreen for that matter. No cpu core uses more than 10% the ddnet client process is as 14% my gpu is at 70% peek and uses 4% mem for the ddnet client
08:25 <+ChillerDragon> is this possibly a issue with my screen and not with my hardware being slow?
08:25 <+ChillerDragon> i have 400 fps and it feels smooth but i get this glitchy line which i always thought means the gpu can not keep up
08:27 <+ChillerDragon> eh horizontal line i mean
08:28 <+ChillerDragon> its been running smooth with this setup for years im not sure what to replace i tried downgrading to linux-lts and nvidia-lts that did not help im thinking about buying a new screen but maybe im stupid xd
08:30 <+ChillerDragon> i would be more confident its just the screen if vim didnt start to take 3s to write a file
08:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> You mean tearing?
08:35 <+ChillerDragon> lmme duckduckgo that
08:36 <+ChillerDragon> yes looks good
08:36 <+ChillerDragon> but i turned on vsync in tw and it didnt help
08:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Then your driver refuses to allow vsync for some reason
08:38 <+ChillerDragon> fak this driver guy
08:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Without vsync the fix is. Buy higher refresh rate monitor xd
08:38 <+ChillerDragon> i have the pay2win nvidia propriatary malware og driver
08:39 <+ChillerDragon> ok i will buy a monitor
08:39 <+ChillerDragon> weird that this monitor worked fine for almost a decade
08:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Maybe u changed gnome compositor settings?
08:39 <+ChillerDragon> maybe the update did
08:39 <+ChillerDragon> what is compositor
08:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The monitor is not broken
08:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> U probably always played with vsync
08:39 <+ChillerDragon> he broke of old age?
08:40 <+ChillerDragon> ok thanks jupsti babe i will buy new monitor that cost more than my graphiccard
08:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Compositor is basically the thing that makes ur windows look like windows xd
08:40 <+ChillerDragon> good financial advice once again
08:40 <+ChillerDragon> i have linux
08:40 <+ChillerDragon> no windows
08:40 <+ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
08:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Trollodragores
08:41 <+ChillerDragon> ye my windows are broken for sure too
08:41 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1684046489.png
08:41 <+ChillerDragon> see my vscode windowing all over the place xd
08:42 <+ChillerDragon> and there is no way to make it stop neither reboot resize or reopen
08:42 <+ChillerDragon> but its electron so hey gnome might not be responsible
08:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> U use Arch right?
08:42 <+ChillerDragon> yes BTW
08:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Well no hate against it. But ofc u are always a beta tester with it
08:43 <+ChillerDragon> wowo
08:43 <+ChillerDragon> arch shaming
08:43 <+ChillerDragon> yea ik thats why this window also doesnt really bother me
08:43 <+ChillerDragon> but the glitchy does and i assume those important things always relate to the driver and kernel
08:44 <+ChillerDragon> and arch offers the easy switch to the lts driver and kernel which makes you travel back in time
08:44 <+ChillerDragon> but this did not help this time .-.
09:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> when u use vk backend & enable vsync, does it mention in F1 console or terminal that it could not enable FIFO mode?
09:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragon: ^
09:27 <+ChillerDragon> no
09:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> thats weird xd
09:27 <+ChillerDragon> wait its because its working
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ¤”
09:28 <+ChillerDragon> ok but thats even worse 
09:29 <+ChillerDragon> i play better when i had 8 beers than w vsyncx
09:29 <+ChillerDragon> but it did seem to have fixed the tearing
09:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok
09:29 <+ChillerDragon> so buying a new screen it is jupsti?
09:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i give u best hack
09:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> wait
09:30 <+ChillerDragon> maybe vsync is only broken for opengl or after reboot it worked now idk
09:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in vulkan_backend.cpp search the function GetPresentationMode
09:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> before
09:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> VKIOMode = g_Config.m_GfxVsync ? VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR : VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR;
09:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> add
09:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> VKIOMode = VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR;
09:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> return;
09:31 <+ChillerDragon> watf
09:31 <+ChillerDragon> hak
09:32 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but pssst
09:33 <+ChillerDragon> so replace the line i guess
09:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> doesnt matter
09:33 <+ChillerDragon> yeye
09:33 <+ChillerDragon> hmm not the best hack
09:33 <+ChillerDragon> still sluggish
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it should prevent tearing
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> while allowing 400fps
09:34 <+ChillerDragon> ah so vsync off
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its basically what wayland does
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh yes
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well it should be off normally lol
09:34 <+ChillerDragon> hmm
09:34 <+ChillerDragon> vsync off still caps me at 60
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nani

09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u forgot the return
09:35 <+ChillerDragon> a
09:36 <+ChillerDragon> true?
09:36 <+ChillerDragon> ah ye u sent scren
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> holy shit
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> tthast works
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> why is it not a cfg?
09:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs it only works with vulkan
09:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and i am too lazy to add bloat
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> i see
09:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the vsync option should be a dropdown
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> gaming with custom patch it is
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> thanks juspti the gfx guru
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> ok still a bit wonkey
09:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes
09:39 <+ChillerDragon> i think ill just buy the new screen
09:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it still adds latency
09:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> have u tried to use unlimited fps
09:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it doesnt prevent it
09:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but makes it a tiny bit better
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> wot
09:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> important also
09:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> cl_refresh_rate 0
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> 480 xd
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> wowo 600 fps
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> but tearing back
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> i think i added the 480 limit once to fix tearing
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah u play on 4k screen right?
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> poor mans vsync
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> yes
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then rip
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 4k and 60fps lmao
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> i gotta buy 4k 144hz
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that must be horror gaming combo
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> more like 4k 240hz
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> its been smooth so far actually
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> i can not affort 4k 240hz 28"
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> afford*
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes u can
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> ok finanical advisor if u say so
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xd
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 1125 â‚¬
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that's free af
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> uff
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> i was more thinking 700
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but 32''
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> 32 hmm
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> im used to 28
09:44 <+ChillerDragon> send link
09:44 <+ChillerDragon> i was thinking this https://www.amazon.de/Gigabyte-Monitore-Monitor-M28U-EK-3840X2160/dp/B09778LZGQ
09:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://www.amazon.de/Samsung-S32BG850NU-UHD-Aufl%C3%B6sung-Reaktionszeit-Bildwiederholrate/dp/B09YV3LYTM/
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> urs 144hz, not future proof
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> invest into my future
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> e wot
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if u buy expensive now, i can buy cheap in 3 years
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> 144hz is fine for my eyes
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> i used 60hz forever
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> and it good gaming xd
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its much better
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but will still see tearing, just less annoying
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> also the screen u sent is broken
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> it has a dent
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> with 240hz its almost gone
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> better would be 480hz
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> invest into 480hz
09:46 <+ChillerDragon> me buying expensive high end stuff makes it cheaper for u in the future?
09:46 <+ChillerDragon> if you say so mr financial pro
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah the market will shift to it eventually then
09:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if everyone would buy 8k tv, they would get mainstream
09:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but nobody wants it
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> yea but curved is cursed
09:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xd
09:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> never used one
09:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs i fear the curse
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> i would try emacs before i try curved screen
09:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but for me 27'' it is
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> i gotta get 28" so i can zooz better in fng
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u can simply go towards the screen with ur eyes
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lifehack
09:48 <+ChillerDragon> hm
09:48 <+ChillerDragon> vr
09:49 <+ChillerDragon> anyone ever tried tw vr gaming? xd
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://www.amazon.de/ASUS-PG27AQN-27-Zoll-esports-Monitor/dp/B0BL82FYV4/
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> my next monitor
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 360hz IPS panel
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nice
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> uff the price bro
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no, i dont have vr setup
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u gotta invest, and feel stupid after 2 years
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> else nothing changes
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> xd
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> progressive screen pioneer
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> its not even 4k .-.
09:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dont need 4k anyway
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> which helps with fps 
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> but still
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dont sit 1 centimeter away from my screen
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> u just said
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i prefer more hertz ðŸ˜„
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> i am big zoozer
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes u need 4k
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u need 16k tbh
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> i loose all my fps anyways with -30 zoom on Back in Time 3
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then all the 4k tee skins finally have a purpose
09:52 <+ChillerDragon> ye tru
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> but i zoom out
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> not in
09:53 <+ChillerDragon> so i basically could downscale
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i should write a compute shader to speedup zooming out rendering
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but so much work <.<
09:54 <+ChillerDragon> you mean more fps while zoomed out due to saving on rendering pixels that dont fit on the screen anyways?
09:54 <+ChillerDragon> that be soo amazing
09:54 <+ChillerDragon> i buy u a beer if u do
09:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah basically like that, but it would involve writing a custom rasterizer, or ray tracer (not like 3d thing), optimized for 2d
09:55 <+ChillerDragon> very pog
09:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> add 20k lines of code, no problem xd
09:55 <+ChillerDragon> i noticed the ddrace pro scene slowly picked up zooming
09:56 <+ChillerDragon> playing with 3 times zoomed out on average and replacing pause with zoom on scroll is such a game changer
09:56 <+ChillerDragon> idk how people ever hammerfly through huuughe parts
09:56 <+ChillerDragon> w out zoom
09:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> game sense
09:57 <+ChillerDragon> i can fall 10k tiles get a hammerhit done at the bottom 10/10
09:59 <+ChillerDragon> also when tees fall next to you from far above with zoom you can easily predict a hook on most falling speeds where regular zoominners wouldnt even manage to react at all let alone hit the hook
10:00 <+ChillerDragon> but yea you need the hardware for it
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> you can always try zooming in you will realize how much harder the game gets and thats comparable to how much easier it gets when zoomed out
10:11 <+ChillerDragon> are ger2 servers not in http master?
10:11 <+ChillerDragon> ``curl -s https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json | jq . | grep ger2``

10:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> time to code ddnet again
10:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what did i miss
10:33 < bridge> <Voxel> what r u gonna add into ddnet
10:33 < bridge> <Voxel> or is it the same PR
10:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chiller and me discussed our plan to conquer the world
10:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk im gonna look
10:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and im gonna merge https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6560
10:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz learath didnt review when he said
10:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im gonna test it first tho xd

11:12 < bridge> <Learath2> I did take a look, I just didn't merge it, thought you wanted to
11:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah, but u didnt state  anywhere u did review it xd
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xD
11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> learath busy man bro
11:12 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah

11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki would u say hiding a bug is better than panic?
11:25 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> hiding = do not crash
11:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u mean the pr i merged?
11:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i would say having no ub is better than anythign else
11:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> then we can think about that
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then we could use dbg_asserts
11:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> make pr
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> instead of hiding the bug
11:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> as some c grandpa once said, talk with code not words
11:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> or smth like that idk
11:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well seems like all devs here disagree with me anyway
11:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :gigachad:
11:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont agree or disagree
11:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im just on a holy crusade against ub
11:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks review my pr and approve it https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6585
11:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> then i make a pr with ur assert
11:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if u tell me what uwant
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it changes server code
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that is like selfkilling
11:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i tested it ^tm

11:43 < bridge> <Learath2> What are we disagreeing on?
11:45 < bridge> <Learath2> Is this a followup or does it replace #5960 completely?
11:45 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5960
11:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> #6497
11:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> followup, i just fixed conflicts and the test
11:45 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6497
11:46 < bridge> <Learath2> I thought we resolved that conflict. You can refuse to launch without a data dir imo but you shouldn't invoke UB while doing so
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well they add this weird patch to allow headless client work without data dir
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> headless pog
11:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xd
11:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> It also fixes the issues if your normal client is missing some files
11:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> it should hang the client if you are missing a language index
11:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u want me to take over https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5558
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> anyway, to me this is a if(... == nullptr) patch
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and they are usually a sign of bad design to me
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> you can ofc disagree
11:48 < bridge> <Robyt3> it shouldn't hang the client if you are missing a language index
11:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> take over as in fix conflicts xd
11:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i mean ddnet isnt the pinacle of design anyways
11:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it uses c++ to begin with
11:49 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
11:49 < bridge> <Robyt3> xD
11:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i agree, but its more effort to revert such stuff than to design it from the start
11:50 < bridge> <Robyt3> write cpp2rust converter and run :justatest:
11:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just make a pr and handle it however u want, but no ub
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> some day in 3000 years i release ddnet-best-vk-edition
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and then i can die
11:51 < bridge> <Learath2> Mh. I forgot about that one. I'll finish it up
11:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> good good
11:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> get to work slave
11:51 < bridge> <Learath2> Might aswell do something I enjoy for once
11:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nice
11:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5737
11:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is such a big pr
11:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and no conflicts
11:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but im 2 lazy to review it
11:52 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah I 1 million % disagree. Who hates null guards even wtf
11:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont know editor much anyway
11:53 < bridge> <Learath2> You should contact Chairn and ask for him to help you get a job in the academia
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah who doesnt likes to spam a if(... == nullptr) to every single code line in existence just bcs someone from 1000 years agos decided it can be null
11:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> even in rust i try not to use too many Option
11:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i am not saying it never makes sense ofc
11:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to a reasonable degree
11:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but in c++ its too dangerous
11:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a option is safe
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah but passing it around everywhere just sucks xD
11:55 < bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, if you don't like the null guard there, move it up the callstack. When you don't find a data dir print an error and quit
11:55 < bridge> <Learath2> Or assert
11:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and unwrapping a option is a panic, a null deref a segfault
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes, totally fine with that
11:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there it makes sense
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah we know how awesomely awesome awesome-rust is, not awesomely enough it still doesn't make awesome fixes more awesome
11:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ok
11:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> awesome
11:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> awesome
11:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a awesome fix is awesome by def tho
11:59 < bridge> <Robyt3> @marmare_314 Do you have time to update https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6546 ?
12:01 < bridge> <Robyt3> Can one of you rust enthusiasts work on https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6279 ?
12:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> at work i just use https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov
12:11 < bridge> <Patiga> ChillerDragon: zoom on mousewheel is goated.
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> nono have you tried?
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> i scroll on mousewheel and zoom on shift+mousewheel its really pog
12:14 <+ChillerDragon> ah i mean i change weapons on regular mousehweel
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> so you can see me doing a emote when i zoom out its very sophisticated
12:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> OH
12:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 i think i found out why
12:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its a bug in rust i think
12:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95825
12:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the ci fails on the doc tests
12:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ok nvm
12:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im blind and cant read
12:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it doesnt fail on the doc test
12:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
12:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> /usr/bin/ld: /home/runner/work/ddnet/ddnet/headless/debug/deps/libddnet_test-5eaca437e040b524.rlib(linereader.cpp.o):(.data.rel+0x20): undefined reference to `__gcov_merge_add'
12:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this looks like a cpp error not rust tho
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> rust fan manages to blame rust bug on c++
12:25 < bridge> <Robyt3> It was caused by adding rust to the build though
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i think its missing -lgcov
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in the rustflags
12:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ill try
12:25 < bridge> <Robyt3> > because the cmake-init-env overwrites outside env variables
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 lol asan triggered on ci
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/actions/runs/4971879116/jobs/8896710547?pr=6586
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is this cuz the branch is old?
12:33 < bridge> <Robyt3> lol is this not rebased on master?
12:33 < bridge> <Robyt3> this also randomly happened in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6565
12:34 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i rebased now, without conflicts
12:34 < bridge> <Robyt3> ok, so it wasn't my PR making the bug happen more frequently
12:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Robyt3 if u can take a look at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6585
12:35 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @fokkonaut this interests u doesnt it
12:36 < bridge> <fokkonaut> yes
12:37 < bridge> <fokkonaut> I still need it xd
12:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> review it again
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki do u want to fix smth?
12:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> fix what?
12:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do you need a task?
12:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im trying to fix the ci coverage rn
12:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but if u know something ez tell
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its very complex
12:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> then no
12:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sad
12:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what is it tho
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> make mouse movement more accurate
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> floats are a problem, e.g. if u have high FPS and add small values to a float it increases the chance of inaccuracy a lot
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> also find out how on different operating systems the relative mouse movement reporting changes based on resolution and DPI
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> SDL documentation is shit like always
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so we should document ourself
12:48 < bridge> <Robyt3> I think a newer SDL version makes some improvements for more accurate mouse movement
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well even ms documentation isnt satisfying to me tbh
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-rawmouse
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its not clear how i should image the relative mouse movement exactly based on the mouse DPI settings
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i mean a mouse with polling rate of 8000 hertz should probably report very slight movements
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> how do you even display that in a integer?
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i doubt they thought about 2023 when they designed the API xd
12:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> In SDL3: "Mouse events use floating point values for mouse coordinates and relative motion values. You can get sub-pixel motion depending on the platform and display scaling."
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah nice
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but why float
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> why not double
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> cant trust floats xd
12:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> or fixed point floats, even better
12:53 < bridge> <Robyt3> floats should be enough for pixel values
12:53 < bridge> <Robyt3> how accurate can you even move a mouse?
12:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> not even perfection is good enough for ddnet
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno, but the sensors have like 23k dpi, and 8000 hertz
12:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess its pretty accurate, and i dont trust floats
12:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/what-do-they-mean-random-numbers-gif-10654449
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i mean wtf even is sub-pixel in this regard?
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do they use the window screen size or what?
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd have thought relative mouse movement is unrelated to that
12:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> meh
12:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it failed again
12:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> out of ideas
12:57 < bridge> <Robyt3> sad, but thanks for trying
12:57 < bridge> <Robyt3> @Jupeyy_Keks Any idea how we get this assertion now? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5143#issuecomment-1546735484
12:58 < bridge> <Robyt3> `Found non empty text container with index 681 with 6 quads 'Team 0'`
12:58 < bridge> <Robyt3> Doesn't look like a `DeleteTextContainer` is missing
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah nice, do you know when we even display Team 0
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> scoreboard?
12:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> nah
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> where tf do we display team 0 xD
13:00 < bridge> <Robyt3> kill message
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i never read this in my entire life in the client (except chat) XD
13:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> is LDFLAGS and LFLAGS different?
13:00 < bridge> <Robyt3> it's new from the team kill messages
13:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> LFLAGS ? never heard
13:00 < bridge> <Robyt3> but it uses the existing kill message code, so it should delete the containers
13:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > no, LFLAGS are additional flags for lex (as in lex & yacc). LDFLAGS is
13:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > used when calling the linker. They are both used for implicit rules.
13:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> LFLAGS
13:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
13:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     Extra flags to give to Lex.
13:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lol
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok then we somehow clear kill msgs
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> without noticing
13:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in worst case memory overflow, sadly kaffeine who could reprod didnt find more
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u rewrite ddnet in latex? nice
13:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no
13:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u know what a lexer is right
13:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> oh yeah misread xd
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lmao, good brain
13:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> need more gehirnjogging
13:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> what
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1107262243772575804/message.txt
13:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lmao
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://futurefive.co.nz/uploads/story/2020/01/21/Braintrain.webp
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> this
13:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in english its called brain age
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it was pretty popular in germany xd
13:05 < bridge> <Robyt3> `Team %d` is also used in the scoreboard, but only with `TextEx`
13:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i suspect textex anyway
13:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but do we ever print out team 0?
13:06 < bridge> <Robyt3> ah, we don't
13:06 < bridge> <Robyt3> so it has to be the kill message text
13:07 < bridge> <Patiga> I enjoyed the tas at agdq, is gud https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSFHKAvTGNk&t=1000s
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> my only thesis on this is:
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> we run out of cmd space in graphics_threaded while being tabbed out, when background rendering is disabled
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but 1. that shouldn't happen very quickly
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 2. i didnt find anything
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i could try to reduce the buffer size to check if i can reprod
13:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah true, saw that before, really awesome ðŸ˜„
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mh seems like the running out of cmd is relatively safe as expected
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> where exactly in the kill messages do we print the t0?
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> do i need to update my server for that?
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i only see my tee and name
13:18 < bridge> <Robyt3> it's easiest to just add some server code to keep sending team kill messages
13:18 < bridge> <Robyt3> you need to be in a team with at least another tee I think
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and how do u do that in team 0 ðŸ˜‚
13:19 < bridge> <Robyt3> hmmmmmm
13:28 < bridge> <Ryozuki> asan
13:30 < bridge> <Robyt3> wtf, why is it happening so often now
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> maybe u changed the code layout so its more often triggered^^
13:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> @Ryozuki Can you merge it anyway, so the usage of `os_version_str` is correct again? I'll work on a fix for the ASAN issue next.
13:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Robyt3 i have an idea
13:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> is the crashlog from you?
13:55 < bridge> <Robyt3> it's from teini94
13:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> can u ask him if he toggles nameplates visisbility or similar
13:57 < bridge> <Robyt3> @teini94 ^ can you check this, about the recent crash popup and the `Found non empty text container with index 681 with 6 quads 'Team 0'` error
13:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> And if not. Do u still have the broken Auto demo
14:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki thanks for wasting your time on cpp just to make ddnet great, what a sacrifise
15:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> big sacrifice
15:48 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> When rework the collisions? hurts to look at

15:49 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> gonna do my own collision check on my system, hopefully it doesn't require me to write 30+ codes for it
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> omg i just did a typo in my email xd when signing up for a web account i now registered that typoed email lmao anyone else got typo versions of the email registered just in case? xd
16:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no xd
16:21 <+ChillerDragon> ryo you need that your gamertag and irl name is a single typo no way ppl get that right the first time
16:22 <+ChillerDragon> royzuki@yahoo.com
16:23 <+ChillerDragon> gotta singup heinrich5990@gmail.com and tell deen i forgot ssh password
17:36 < bridge> <ReiTW> :kek:
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 monthly request to get snap into dissector but this time i actually it only ending up in the json any chance you could rename the kind from data to something custom like snap_data? https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/89ec0167e7ad1c6fa60d96788d2005a04aee43d4/gamenet/generate/spec/teeworlds-0.7.5.json#L957
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> need*
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> years of irc i and i still proof read my messages after sending them gg
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im reviving edlang again
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> now im using logos as the lexer
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> next use lexer as the logo
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> fn main(x: i64) -> i64 {
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     let x = 2 + 3;
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     return x;
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> }
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> to
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```llvm
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ; ModuleID = 'simple.ed'
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> source_filename = "simple.ed"
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> define i64 @main(i64 %0) {

17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> }
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
17:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ok i32 is wrong kek
17:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> imagine having type resolution
17:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway
18:21 < bridge> <Chairn> my default zoom level is 7 so zoomed out 3 times
18:22 < bridge> <Chairn> i know some players uses 5 zoom out, but i cant see tees besides me if i do that
18:26 < bridge> <Robyt3> here is the demo, doesn't crash for me though

18:26 < bridge> <Chairn> ah the voice of reason, you post source ðŸ™‚
18:26 < bridge> <Robyt3> here is the demo, doesn't crash for me though. he uses a nameplate bind
18:26 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1107343168753635479/text_container_empty_Team_0.demo
18:26 < bridge> <Chairn> what do you think analog data types are closer to?
18:27 < bridge> <Chairn> most efficient ai designs are already analog
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> physics
18:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs our brain works like that
18:29 < bridge> <Chairn> you're replying to yourself, uh?
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah the crash is not in ofc, if someone gets it, he should press his nvidia replay bind lmao
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:30 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mhh i wonder wtf could have print t0
18:31 < bridge> <Chairn> have you ever heard of `x == x+1` returning `true` ðŸ˜„ ?
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sry my brain is not suited to understand how your 300 IQ questions are in relation to what i wrote
18:33 < bridge> <Chairn> closer to in terms of digital data types
18:34 < bridge> <Chairn> i was doubly referencing brains and analog designs outperforming digital designs
18:34 < bridge> <Chairn> linked to the float being inaccurate
18:34 < bridge> <Chairn> single precision is around 7 digits exact
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well i guess floats have all kind weirdness ^^
18:35 < bridge> <Chairn> double precision has 15 exact digits, iirc
18:35 < bridge> <Learath2> I wanted to add to my statement, but didn't want to edit it since it looks weird on irc
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> as soon as floats are not in [-1, 1] they start to suck
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ok no, they always suck
18:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i take that back

18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Reteah
18:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> lemme write it in vim and I'll copy pasta
18:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I had a InTeReSTIng (interesting) idea for a 3D game, which maybe also be applicable to 2D (mainly to tw).
18:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> For 3D:
18:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> You would see 3 viewports One for each hand (2 hands) and one for the head. You would play with 2 mice one mouse for each hand. Each mouse would control one "hand" camera and the "head" camera would change direction slowly to the most uptodate hand camera.
18:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> You would 
18:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7>     1. move the (hand) cameras via the mouse movement
18:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7>     2. move the player (fwd, bwd) with scroll on one mouse and (left, right) with scroll one the other mouse.
18:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7>     3. fire with LMB and hook with RMB for each hand.
18:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7>     3. switch weapons with MB4 and MB
18:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> For 2D (in this case for tw):
18:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> You would only have one viewport (camera) but 2 cursors (one for each hand). It pretty self explanatory I think on how it would work.
18:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd try it out, sounds funny for e.g. fng
18:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Yeah, right? xD
18:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> atm I am trying to figure out how to get input from each mouse separately.
18:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> The best idea so far is to get the input from /dev/input/eventX. Where X would correspond to the mouse event eg /dev/input/event3
18:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.arewesixelyet.com
18:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sdl sends device id, doesnt it
18:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> zogtib says that we should we use libinput (run it and sed stuff so we end the the scroll, mouse movement and buttons) but I wanna see how libinput works and do the same stuff Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
18:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think it only does for gamecontroller not mice
18:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> lemme look it pu
18:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> lemme look it up
18:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lol is he x11 dev?
18:53 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I think it only does for gamecontroller not mice (xorg doesn't send the device id of mice to windows which is the current problem)
18:53 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> no xD
18:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I had a InTeReSTIng (interesting) idea for a 3D game, which maybe also be applicable to 2D (mainly to tw).
18:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> For 3D:
18:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> You would see 3 viewports One for each hand (2 hands) and one for the head. You would play with 2 mice one mouse for each hand. Each mouse would control one "hand" camera and the "head" camera would change direction slowly to the most uptodate hand camera.
18:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> You would 
18:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7>     1. move the (hand) cameras via the mouse movement
18:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7>     2. move the player (fwd, bwd) with scroll on one mouse and (left, right) with scroll one the other mouse.
18:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7>     3. fire with LMB and hook with RMB for each hand.
18:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7>     3. switch weapons with MB4 and MB5
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Uint32 which;       /**< The mouse instance id, or SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID */
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ` Uint32 which;       /**< The mouse instance id, or SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID */ `
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess with instance they mean device?
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the sdl events else send this
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the SDL api to get the position apparently not
18:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sdl internally has a single mouse
18:57 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah makes sense
18:59 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> does sdl get mouse movement and stuff from /dev/input/* or from the window?
19:00 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I found this https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/f9d1f34b6ca5b9efa4d0eed6f6caba6823c9e395
19:00 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> so maybe it's possible? :)
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> X11_Xinput2
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno looks overly complicated how sdl solved all this xd
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but yeah seems at least for the events it has a unique id
19:03 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> if we can get it from sdl for tw it'd be very easy to implement
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i mean
19:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> plug mouse in
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> printf
19:04 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> be happy
19:04 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> dond wori
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> did we ever have a report that this happened on a (latest) ddnet server?
19:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i feel like it's always on old servers.
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> koffein was on infection
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> teini probably uses ddrock from 1995
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
19:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> also i wonder what happens if we have a server demo
19:56 < bridge> <reaper> Hi, i have a small question in the round. My modification is not displayed under DDnet and i can not connect via IP. But in the vanilla client everything works fine. Someone has solutions for me?
19:56 < bridge> <reaper> Hi, i have a small question. My modification is not displayed under DDnet and i can not connect via IP. But in the vanilla client everything works fine. Someone has solutions for me?
19:57 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> only official servers are under DDNet
19:57 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> other servers are under Internet or LAN tab
19:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Also if it's not visible on the Internet  tab but it's visible on the LAN tab make sure you have port-foward and that you have set "sv_register 1"
20:03 < bridge> <reaper> Ok, maybe i wrote it wrong. Under the vanilla client i find the server and can also connect via IP. With DDnet i can not find the server or can connect by IP. The server is already online and there are no problems with the firewall/master server.
20:03 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Hmm sounds like you made a mod based on 0.7 which ddnet doesn't support. DDNet mods support 0.6 and 0.7 (in most cases)
20:03 < bridge> <reaper> 0.7.2
20:04 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah for versions 0.7.x only 0.7 clients can connect
20:04 < bridge> <reaper> version 0.7 5d6a173c8ba2de7e
20:04 < bridge> <reaper> oh ok, ty ðŸ™‚
21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> merging is now luck based xd
21:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye it doesn't work :( here's the code I used
21:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ```c
21:06 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> #include <stdio.h>

21:07 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7>             break;
21:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh nice
21:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> you found it!
21:31 < bridge> <Chairn> hmmm, apparently server changed behavior in the last 2 days
21:31 < bridge> <Chairn> map oco is unfinishable right now as tele 0 is teleporting you instead of just not working
21:31 < bridge> <murpi> Correct, caused by this specific commit:
21:31 < bridge> <murpi> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6534/commits/245703798bdf15761b0740fbf64b282234b524e1
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what, no way
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> :7
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what sdl version did u use?
21:43 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> pacman -Qs sdl ```

21:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> sad
21:47 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ye
22:18 < bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> weird how changing a condition value from float to bool and make changes according to the type will break maps xd
22:41 < bridge> <Robyt3> the map tricks the player with a CFRM tile that doesn't work because it's tele number is set to zero, which now no longer works, because the tele tile number is ignored for tiles that should not be affected by it
22:41 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1107407267499876512/image.png
22:44 < bridge> <Robyt3> with new client version the tele tile number is not even rendered for those tiles, where it's unused
22:44 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1107408077810044928/image.png
22:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> imho we should fix the map instead of adapting the code for a wrong case
22:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> if i understood correctly
22:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, but according to @murpi it's an april fool's themes map, so this sort of ruins the theme
22:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> but I'd also prefer if the map was changed instead of adding a weird special case
22:53 < bridge> <Robyt3> but I'd also prefer if the map was changed instead of adding a weird special case in the code
22:53 < bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, but according to @murpi it's an april fool's themed map, so this sort of ruins the theme
22:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> definitly no special case in code
23:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> If it's only a single map affected.. simply remove it?
23:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think entities should be april-fools-proof
23:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> IMO they should work as reliable as inspect-element in the browser
23:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> anyway, the following maps set a teleporter number of 0 (and should be fixed IMO):
23:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
23:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991>      17 "types/brutal/maps/Intercepter.map"
23:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991>       3 "types/dummy/maps/Pace.map"
23:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991>     154 "types/moderate/maps/Sky Stone.map"
23:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991>      24 "types/moderate/maps/oco.map"
23:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991>       1 "types/solo/maps/GetSpeed2.map"
23:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
23:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (thanks to @Patiga for this btw)
23:15 < bridge> <Chairn> 2 @konsti map in there, :thonk:
23:21 < bridge> <Learath2> I'm fairly sure the testing people disagree :/
23:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (I think there's even a testing rule about it; don't abuse bugs. not that it is really followed)
23:22 < bridge> <murpi> Only oco uses tele 0 as an gameplay element I think
23:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> where do you get that? I'm pretty sure konsti would also play tricks like that
23:22 < bridge> <murpi> I've played all of them
23:23 < bridge> <Patiga> I'd thought that it is probable, on getspeed4 it was rejected where konsti wanted to do a secret room with it
