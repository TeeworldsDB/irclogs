09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jeroen> The confirmation screen when you press the quit button is gone, is it supposed to be like that?
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jeroen Yes, why would you need to confirm the quit?
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Only when you have an unsaved map or long progress on a map (> 20 minutes by default) the confirmation will appear
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (unsaved map in editor)
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cl_confirm_disconnect_quit_time is the setting if you want to change it
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> same for disconnecting dummy and regular player
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jeroen> thanks, I liked the extra confirm screen since i sometimes accidentally press it instead of the settings.
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cl_confirm_disconnect_quit_time 0 and you will be asked every time
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and -1 to never get asked
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Wow, i set cl_confirm_disconnect_quit_time to -1 and i have this popup?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bleidd64> /points isn't autocompleted -_-
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jesus Christ anyone else with this problem? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1532
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Bleidd64 ha, because it's mysql only, I forgot about that!
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> client can't know if the server has mysql or not
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> opengl on debian 10 using the debian build
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/561180436856963084/unknown.png
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> opengl3?
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just said it ^
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think that's a common issue, I always had that at specific zooms
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, we always use opengl
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but you can enable opengl3 in settings
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y im using 3
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> disable it
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont like how it looks without anymore
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think the general consensus is that GPU drivers are too buggy so we will never get it 100% fixed
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> Holy @jao destructive tool is insane and already question mark destruction to delete example only freeze ! But however very cool !
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> Holy @jao destructive tool is insane and already question mark destruction to delete example only freeze ! But however very cool ! Thank you
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> NOW in my new map it will be easier to create this map ! â™¥
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> or not
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/561217464718065664/unknown.png
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> or not ðŸ˜¦
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/561217464718065664/unknown.png
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it doesn't work across layers
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not sure if that would make much sense
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> e.g. you want to place unfreeze in tele
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> is this a new function on ddnet ?
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, in 12.0
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> cool i like that when i make somethink in map and save and go in game my fps stands 144 not droping to 72 fps :/
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> and also now Hud map and not game menu is looking a lot smoother !
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> dummy connects a lot faster ! â™¥
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> What does this function do
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> IN THE DDNET AND KOG TABS THERE SHOULD NOT BE A CHECK
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i thought about that too
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but left it in for consistency
