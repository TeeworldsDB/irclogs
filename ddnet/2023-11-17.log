00:28 < bridge> <Ewan> okay well not like 100% of all C/C++ but a big portion of itâ€¦ lol
00:29 < bridge> <Ewan> in the situations where ppl care about switching from C go rust, itâ€™s just more efficient to write in rust because itâ€™s much harder to accidentally invoke UB or do something obviously unsafe
00:29 < bridge> <Ewan> often itâ€™s low level applications and/or backend stuff and not things like games yet
00:31 < bridge> <Ewan> yea itâ€™s possible to write â€˜equally safeâ€™ code but it requires much more attention and experience
00:31 < bridge> <Ewan> yea itâ€™s possible to write â€˜equally safeâ€™ code in C/C++ but it requires much more attention and experience
00:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> doesn't seem to be possible, given our experience from browsers
01:20 < bridge> <totar> Is there a reason?
01:33 < bridge> <Ewan> anything is possible depending on how you structure your code. it's just not realistic to put the time & effort into making such code
01:33 < bridge> <Ewan> they decided it would be easier to just make a safer language lol

07:01 < bridge> <pisisik> I agree with you that the ranked system needs an improvement, I had exact same thoughts lately. Like it is ridicululous that even 10-20 ranks dont count when they are displayed on map page, but better would be to count 1-100 ranks. You can start taking into account ranks from 11 to 100 without changing the current system by introducing non-whole points. Now rank 10 gets 1 point, why not make it that rank 11 gets 0.99 points, rank 12 gets 0.98 point

08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> My assumption is. Heinrich saw that command in an issue, and then looked at the definition. And then decided that the maximum ping someone has is around 300.
08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But i guess u'll only find out if u comment on the pr xd

09:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Browsers rust is crashing? Or unsafe ?
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> It's about the claim that cpp can be just as safe. Which in itself is true, but browsers show that humans are either not good enough or have to few resources to make equally good and safe software
09:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Also safe in this context mostly means memory safe
09:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> That Firefox is crashing more often than Chrome makes my experience using it less safe xd
09:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> im at gym rn
09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Train your brain
09:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> I think im already smart
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually maybe not

09:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks the power of rust is its matematically proven
09:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> the borrow checker is right

09:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Fun fact the hipster rust tools panic more often into my face than the giga chad C tools that have not been updated since I was born
09:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> what tools
09:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> In fact the only C tools I can think of that crash are teeworlds and gdb :D
09:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Idk I just saw a lot of rust panic messages. From some random 20 github star projects
09:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> a panic is better than segfault
09:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> my gym has bad signal xd and no wifi
09:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
09:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Good
