05:29 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> why does every coding channel have to be such an arrogant prick
05:29 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> why does every coding yt channel have to be such an arrogant prick
07:16 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't know
07:16 < bridge> <Ewan> that's why i don't watch them
07:17 < bridge> <Ewan> i also don't think it's just arrogance
07:17 < bridge> <Ewan> general unlikability
07:18 < bridge> <Ewan> something about the general personality of people who code + the general personality of people who usually videos is a bad mix
09:35 < bridge> <teero777> inactive channel

10:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> steam is 20 year old
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> In March of 2004, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> is the first game we launch on Steam, and Half-Life 2
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> has its big debut on November 16th.
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> In between these two releases, Codename: Gordon
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> comes out in May as (technically!) the first-ever third-party release on Steam. (Unfortunately the game is eventually delisted but still an important part of Steam's history!)
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> Other fun facts from 2004:
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> Facebook and the Motorola Razr launch (not together, of course); Google goes public; the Numa Numa kid hits it big in meme land.
10:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> omg
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> scroll through the web
10:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> its such a nostalgia trip
12:29 < bridge> <sedonya> Process finished with exit code -1073741819 (0xC0000005)
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> my rust programs finish with exit code 0
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> safer
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
12:33 < bridge> <teero777> Any context? xd
12:33 < bridge> <heinrich5991> my duckduckgo says "access violation"
12:34 < bridge> <teero777> So it's a segfault?
12:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
12:35 < bridge> <teero777> @sedonya a little more info would be cool xd
12:35 < bridge> <teero777> What were you doing?
12:35 < bridge> <teero777> can you reproduce it?
12:36 < bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll:
12:42 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> how much bandwith / data does ddnet/teeworlds use while playing?
12:44 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> per player
12:45 < bridge> <teero777> The server?
12:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah and the client
12:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ig for server this https://ddnet.org/stats/server/ is a good reference
12:47 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> well nvm that's all the info I need ^^
14:13 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> my python code on windows returns 0 too
14:13 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> checkmate
14:14 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> oh yeah that too
14:15 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> every time i try to find what language i should learn to make something theres always like 10 options that are battling against each other
14:16 < bridge> <heinrich5991> language doesn't really matter that much. what matters a lot more is actually building stuff ðŸ™‚
14:18 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> that makes sense
14:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> use the right tool for the job, but given ur not being paid, use the tool its most fun for the job
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> aka rust
14:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
14:44 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> python on windows is fun as hell
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I call you an ambulance
15:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> You an ambulance, you an ambulance
15:52 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :monkaStop: i dont get it
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I'm glad you asked
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://youtu.be/K9H8joWHvk4?feature=shared
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> But anyway pythons are evil, he careful or they eat you
15:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Better stay safe with...
15:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust
16:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://blog.jetbrains.com/rust/2023/09/13/introducing-rustrover-a-standalone-rust-ide-by-jetbrains/
16:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Probably costs money?
16:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
16:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> but RustRover > CLion
16:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
16:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Stuff the world doesn't need
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> true
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust-analyzer is better anyway
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> As if they don't use it anyway xd
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
16:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think not
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> So it shows no errors? Xd
16:31 < bridge> <__admin> skill issue i get it for free thx to my school
16:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> skill issue vscode is better
16:31 < bridge> <__admin> skilli issue vi is better
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> i could ask my company and i would probs get it but its not worth it
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> perks of being a professional rust dev :ez:
16:32 < bridge> <__admin> yes, i use vs instead of clion too
16:33 < bridge> <__admin> im jealous
16:34 < bridge> <__admin> except i hate rust
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer%27s_Day
16:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> congrats to myself
16:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in what way?
16:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can probably get it for contributing to an open-source project
16:38 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> rust literally deteriorates metal.. your computer is made of metal...
16:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Rust is a mushroom
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i tried idea long ago and i found it worse, also with this change intellij goes closed source on the plugin and the public is discontinued
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> also rust-analyzer is open source
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> and made by someone who knows a lot
16:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> altho idk if he is still there or not xd
16:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > i tried idea long ago and i found it worse
16:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but in what way? ^^
16:40 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> proof
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> "Rust (programming language) (named after the Rust fungus[27])"
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(fungus)
16:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Fungus is Latin for mushroom
16:57 < bridge> <chairn> actually, there's more oxide (so technically rust) than metal in a chip
17:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> ðŸ¤“
17:21 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> damn
17:21 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> so the language is trying to be so ego its naming itself after the oxide
17:56 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there is more vacuum than particles in the air
17:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm hmm. depends on your definitions I guess
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> rust is vacuum
17:59 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @_voxeldoesart what are your top3 things u hate about python?
17:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't like about python that it's still figuring out proper dependency management
18:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't like about rust that it doesn't really have a stable ABI
18:00 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> that i dont know code more things in it
18:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah i agree
18:01 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> python is perfect
18:01 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> because i made my image slicer in it
18:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> python is confusing
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @_voxeldoesart here a present for you
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1151549928171110583/skin_split.rs
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> skin splitter in rust
18:09 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> mine's better
18:09 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> because i made it
18:09 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> therefore it has voxel bias
18:09 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mine is balzingly fast
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and blazingly safe
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and blazingly documented xD
18:11 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i am blazingly at work and will forget you ever did this when i get home
18:11 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> and then im gonna code smth else in python on my windows 10
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what win10.. u not a true windows fanboy

18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> # Use a loop to iterate through the array and build the command
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> command="your_command_name"
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for arg in "${args[@]}"; do
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª>   command+=" $arg"
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> done
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> # Now, you can execute the command
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> eval "$command"

18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @ravie_ravie do u have the SVG version of this skin xd
18:38 < bridge> <ravie_ravie> what for?
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd like to have a HD version
18:39 < bridge> <ravie_ravie> we can add a 512 version to the db I guess
18:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> would be cool ðŸ˜„
18:40 < bridge> <ravie_ravie> if I can find it that is
18:40 < bridge> <ravie_ravie> I keep basically all files but name them terribly :justatest:

21:05 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> is that from them? would be funny troll xd
22:26 < bridge> <gerdoe> moved from arch to win10 due to nothing but a lot of required programs are windows-only
23:27 < bridge> <chairn> required for?
23:36 < bridge> <reitw> did u try to winify them (I mean wine)
23:39 < bridge> <Ewan> required for sanity most likely
