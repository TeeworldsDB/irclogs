01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i have another suggestion with easier implementation
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> saving selected weapon
01:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on /save?
03:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 can you take a look at F-Client support? I really want to release a new version :D
03:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And I would like to share it with good support on DDNet, but I need to know how you want the net messages etc
03:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> what about stuff like grenade
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> or a map where you have to wait for bullets to move out of the way
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> on death also
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> oh and @noby how do you know who is real? Or how do you even define real? Is it the person who used the name first or more activley?
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> the middle graph in debug mode shows packet loss right?
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> i dont think so
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> i think its more the input delay
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> well its the one graph that changes whenever i lagg hard
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> yes it is :D
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/b70a59d112ad2c58e6a54bca0d4740e9680a98f1/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L1847-L1866
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> i wonder if this data is evidence enough to show who is fake and who is real ._. https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610032016.png
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> i mean two tees can always pick the same name individually without knowing each other :/
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what does that mean for me? is there anything i can do against these laggs?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ../filename.cc:57:15: error: ignoring return value of â€˜int system(const char*)â€™, declared with attribute warn_unused_result [-Werror=unused-result]

16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how would I ignore the return value? it works if I assign it to a variable that I then ignore
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> it wants you to do if(system()) { happy(); }
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (void)!system("ls");
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> See https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=66425
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thnaks
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 any highlights from rc3? I watched a few talks, but fewer than usual
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> lots of technical difficulties in the live versions btw
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't have any must-watch talks, but I can tell you a few I liked
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I only ever watched recordings, I don't like live broadcasts ðŸ˜„
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> COVID-19 Exposure Notifications Â­â€” explains some technical details about the coronawarnapp, didn't know everything
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Climate Tipping Points â€” illustrates what climate tipping points are with a very approachable example
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Scientific Literacy 101 â€” talks a bit about how careful one has to be with what kind of scientific results
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> LVI: Hijacking Transient Execution through Microarchitectural Load Value Injection â€” before watching that talk, I didn't understand how one could possible leak data using wrong cached data (which is going to be rolled back anyway)
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Hacking the Nintendo Game & Watch â€” typical console hacking stuff, I just have to watch one of these on each ccc ^^
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is there anything other than this that you can recommend? @deen
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hacking German Elections, CIA vs WikiLeaks were great, This is not a Game was weird
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah yea, also watched the first two
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @ChillerDragon  if people use the same [common] name then neither one can really claim it
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @deen wasnt this changed to prevent spamming
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, the commit message was unclear
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i mean the fact that it does not show when people join spec
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> was introduced to prevent server message spam i thought
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> isnt it only when mods were moving someone to spec
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @louis https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3485/commits/a985d8479c0cb12a89f2688df324984873acb41d
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @louis <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3485/commits/a985d8479c0cb12a89f2688df324984873acb41d>
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> big embed wtf
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no embed
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> big deen
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> (edited)
19:31 <+ChillerDragon> @noby yea sure names like "killer" "blue" etc are to generic but sometimes you wonder is it rly unique if one names him self like xXxHunterxXx or similar
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> then whoever used the name first gets to claim it right
19:32 <+ChillerDragon> also im one of 3 ChillerDragon's is it a generic name? maybe?
19:32 <+ChillerDragon> im the 3rd :/
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> uh
19:32 <+ChillerDragon> dont ban me pls :/
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> who are the others?
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> there is some inactive tw player mostly grenade based also german who plays 1-2 years longer than me
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> did u know about him when u picked ur name?
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> nobody knows him because he is not very active 
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> no i found out 4 yrs after using the name
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well i guess its more of a subjective thing like
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> he was bullied cuz ppl thought he was fake of me
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if they used the name once 4ys ago
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> which is rude
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and uve used it 1000x since then
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> then u should get to claim it
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> he is somewhat active since almost a decade tho
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> just casually playing some ddnet or zcatch here and there
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> > he was bullied cuz ppl thought he was fake of me
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> to be fair there are several people who do fake u
19:35 <+ChillerDragon> so one can steal a name and claim it if more present in the community?
19:35 <+ChillerDragon> yes ok i have to admit people intentionally fake me those can be identified by using a typod version of my clan and my skin etc
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> nouis
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> theres a Chiller :D on kog
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> nouis
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats not faking tho
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it has to be the same name
19:35 <+ChillerDragon> thats a completley different name
19:35 <+ChillerDragon> ok lemme leak the name
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> @louis  ban fake colo colo on multimap
19:35 <+ChillerDragon> the guy who complained on my server is called !Fear!
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> is that unique?
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> idk
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i'm not at my computer
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> maybe another dude picked the name as well
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> !Fear! is unique but Fear is not
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> hm
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if it can be considered "stealing" then no in that case its not so straightforward
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if theyre inactive and dont use the name anymore then its not really stealing
19:36 <+ChillerDragon> so you sure that the fear who joined a bit later and has less activity is a fake for sure?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that seems like an uncommon name
19:37 <+ChillerDragon> yea its a mess thats why im usually not seeing faking as bad to avoid missunderstanbdings
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont think i can say if its for sure
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but i dont think allowing faking is the right approach either
19:37 <+ChillerDragon> hm
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> well that guy was about to loose his quality kd
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> so i banned the other one :/
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> feels so bad
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> well name banned the other one
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if something difficult like that comes up i try to figure it out by looking at ips and asking people in the community and asking them to add me on another service like discord
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> discord :troll:
19:38 <+ChillerDragon> he wrote a mail to me and complained xd
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> knowing u it was probably a physical letter that went thru the postal service
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> :D
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> the only from i accept user reports in
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> good strategy to avoid having to do admin work
19:39 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> make people pay for postage to report other tees within a few days
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> ppl open issues on teeworlds/teeworlds when my server gets ddosed
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> because they cant reach me xd
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> because u dont use discord like everyone else
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> i use discord
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> well
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> @noby ban fake colo colo on multimap and sendaled bot
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> i use the irc channel #teeworlds-ctf
19:40 <+ChillerDragon> nobody writes there i wonder if its broken
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> dont see him @Kenzoo and no u
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @ChillerDragon yes its broken in the sense that its IRC and no one uses it
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> nvm he rq @noby
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610044693.png
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> did u get it?
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> troll
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> fu
19:41 <+ChillerDragon> did u leave the server?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what server
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no it worked
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i was just looking at the wrong channel
19:42 <+ChillerDragon> yea ppl could contact me there so yee
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> anyways i built a ip lookup thingy an kick if the name and region missmatch @noby
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> might be something u could use too instead of random manual bans
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what if someone moves or is on vacation
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> then a mod has to change it
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> and that guy claims he doesnt play in vac
19:43 <+ChillerDragon> what a nub
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it even vacation if u dont play tw
19:44 <+ChillerDragon> right
19:44 <+ChillerDragon> then u call ur self chiller@vac
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> also i wouldnt call it random manual bans its more like
19:44 <+Ryozuki> hi ChillerDragon 
19:44 <+ChillerDragon> dont wanna mess up ur stats with chinese ping right @noby
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> manual bans as needed if someones faking and causing problems for the original
19:44 <+ChillerDragon> so u use vac name anyways
19:44 <+ChillerDragon> o/ Ryozuki 
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> true except i already have bad ping x_x
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> this o/ seems to be a irc thing nerds like Oy and Learath use it
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> yea anyways onbgy maybe i could inspire you to make more bans for faking
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> automated
19:45 <+ChillerDragon> what a weird thing to say
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> hows the rate of false positives
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i cant believe chillerdragon is advocating for bans now
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> 0% so its good
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how so
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> if nobody else wants the name
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> all good
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> only 1 name affected
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> or is false postive ban for the real guy?
19:46 <+Ryozuki> \o/
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> what if ur nameless tee
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> only in vac but that guy only plays at home
19:46 <+ChillerDragon> if ur nameless tee ur not in danger cuz that name is not protected
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohh its only for protected names
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah that would be cool
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if its opt-in
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> sure
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> people who want that go to admins and say pls only allow my name from these regions
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> that would be cool actually
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> :)
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how long does it ban for
19:47 <+ChillerDragon> kick only
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im surprised u didnt just make it change their name to blank or something
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> are u fake chillerdragon
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> i went with the region field from ipinfo.io so it is somewhat big enough so that you can move in town or some database offsets are delt with
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> but its more strict than country
19:48 <+ChillerDragon> so a vpn wont hit the region
19:49 <+ChillerDragon> ofc im fake real chillerdragon doesnt advocat kicks or bans or trys to combat fakers
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wait
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how do u access ipinfo.io from tw
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> dont u need to pay xd
19:49 <+ChillerDragon> u cant change name in vanilla
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> or are u parsing the html
19:49 <+ChillerDragon> my sevrer is a united 0.7 server
19:49 <+ChillerDragon> so i can only kick or ban
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ew i forgot it was 0.7
19:49 <+ChillerDragon> my mod is written in python
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> i use the ipinfo package
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> and a free tier account token
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> liek 50k requests per whatever
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> do u also get the vpn detection in that package?
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> its only to combat one polski dude who joined like under 1k times total
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if u just want region lookup then u dont have to use an api at all
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> just use maxminddb like infc does
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> yea
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> should
19:50 <+ChillerDragon> wait
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> totally offline, infinite requests
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> yea
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> thought about that too
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> but it was so ez to use ipinfo xd
19:51 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610045327.png
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ezier to reuse code that already exists
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> it has this in the ui but nothing in the json idk
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oo yeah
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thats the thing i was interested in
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> probably a way to get it
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think thats what u have to pay for
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> you need that information to recommend users to not play tw without tor or vpn right?
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> because ppls could steal their rcon pw in public places
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> so nice of you
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah.. recommend .. ðŸ™ƒ
19:53 <+ChillerDragon> so nice
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no it just kicks them with a link to my discord
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> theres a bypass password
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if someone realy needs vpn
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> sometimes i wonder why i stopped playing on ur server
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> then u drop something like this xd
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> because its harder to evade bans there?
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> leak ip or phone num lul
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh because i use discord
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wait what?
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it doesnt require a phone number
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> discord banned me for not giving them a phone num so ....
19:54 <+Ryozuki> they didnt nobo
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> they did
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> :p
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can make a free throwaway discord account to post on my discord and explain why u want vpn
19:54 <+Ryozuki> but u keep believing this
19:55 <+ChillerDragon> i asked support
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u dont need a phone number to do that
19:55 <+ChillerDragon> i sent letter
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and then they can join the server with vpn and leak neither
19:55 <+ChillerDragon> u should make the bridge on ur discord support writeing and link irc
19:55 <+ChillerDragon> #fng
19:55 <+ChillerDragon> best read only irc
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> except no one uses irc
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i tried making an irc bridge and it was just abused by spammers
19:55 <+Ryozuki> i do
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u have discord
19:56 <+Ryozuki> @noby thats racism against irc users
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> are irc uses their own race now
19:56 <+Ryozuki> :flag_us:
19:56 <+Ryozuki> lmao it works
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
19:56 <+ChillerDragon> u still have a active bridge @noby
19:56 <+ChillerDragon> i read it from time to time
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> really
19:56 <+ChillerDragon> i even get pinged there xd
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i guess its 1 way bridge
19:56 <+ChillerDragon> when ppl mention ChillerDragon i get a irc ping
19:56 <+Ryozuki> @noby fix everyone on #fng
19:57 <+Ryozuki> ddnet did it
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> did it work
19:57 <+ChillerDragon> well i maintain the bridge
19:57 <+ChillerDragon> so i should fix it i gues xd
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and not just @ everyone ping
19:57 <+Ryozuki> omg
19:57 <+Ryozuki> u lazy 
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> also just spam in general
19:57 <+ChillerDragon> oof
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if someone spams on discord u can ban their account
19:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if they spam on irc what can i do
19:57 <+ChillerDragon> yea i was looking into rate limit bots for irc but yeee
19:57 <+ChillerDragon> no need for the @ btw noby
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> im sure there are ways to be disruptive without falling foul of any sort of ratelimit
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> posting nsfw / giant messages etc
19:59 <+ChillerDragon> nsfw so nice
19:59 <+Ryozuki> @noby what ppl do in irc is
19:59 <+Ryozuki> talk alone
19:59 <+Ryozuki> by themselves
19:59 <+Ryozuki> its rly weird
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont want my dc to get suspended
19:59 <+ChillerDragon> .fortune
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> because there is noone else to talk to
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> because its irc
19:59 <+Ryozuki> no
19:59 <+Ryozuki> its a dude that speaks half english
19:59 <+Ryozuki> probs a russian
19:59 <+Ryozuki> rly funny
19:59 <+ChillerDragon> read only is so frustraiting https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1610045789.png
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> LOL
20:00 <+ChillerDragon> nobody will ever found how many times i responded
20:00 <+ChillerDragon> pepesad
20:00 <+ChillerDragon> and what
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> whats the bottom line about

20:01 <+ChillerDragon> my chat input?
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> or the one above?
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the long line above that
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> idk to look hackerman ask Ryozuki
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> the numbers
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> probably leaking my bank
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> quiz of the day
20:02 <+ChillerDragon> i never wondered tbh i just stare at it daily since a few months
20:02 <+ChillerDragon> onbgy you should join fokkos discord so we can write there :)
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> didnt u just leak ryos domain
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> how
