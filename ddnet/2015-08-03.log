09:05 < Shiki> hi
09:05 < Shiki> is anyone else annoyed by sort on serverbrowser tabs not being stable?
09:06 < Shiki> apparently it uses *stable_sort* to sort tabs initially https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/client/serverbrowser.cpp#L308
09:07 < Shiki> but sorting there could be non-stable with almost the same effect, as it's not sorted after click on tab by user apparently

16:33 < Savander> Hi
16:33 < Chairn> hello
16:46 < uchar> hi
16:46 <@deen> Chairn: so I talked to Aoe and he said a .map background would be better, which I agree with
16:46 < uchar> i tell it now
16:47 < Chairn> that doesnt change anything
16:47 <@deen> Chairn: what?
16:47 < Chairn> because it is still a png file inside
16:47 <@deen> Chairn: and what if you don't just want a png file inside?
16:47 < Chairn> ?
16:47 <@deen> instead some color transition, animations, stars, movement
16:48 < Chairn> oh
16:48 < uchar> My way is append the background.map to beginning "on the fly"...
16:48 <@deen> like regular map backgrounds
16:48 < Chairn> well then
16:49 < Chairn> so we have to extract background from the .map
16:49 < Chairn> .map can be any map or special map that just contains background?
16:50 < uchar> can contain quads and envelopes, etc..
16:50 < uchar> no?
16:50 < uchar> the only not needed is a collisions, ...
16:50 < uchar> xD
16:51 < Chairn> yeah but you can have quads for titles
16:51 < uchar> you try do it Chairn?
16:51 < Chairn> some quads that are not part of the background
16:52 < uchar> ofc you need use .maps for these porpuose..
16:53 < uchar> idk... or perhaps get the backgrounnd from any map... :\ but if i understand good in principle only for "special" .maps
16:54 < uchar> but doesn't exists any method for know what is background and what no
16:54 < Chairn> group order
16:54 < uchar> ahhh but isn't for the 100% of maps
16:55 < laxadedi> Chairn: look pm
17:13 < uchar> umm the problem appending is know what is background.map and what current.map
17:15 < uchar> umm saving a index where the current.map starts xD
17:21 < Mahdi> Hello
17:22 < Mahdi> I've got a problem recently. I'm getting some screen lags in a way that my screen freezes in the game for a second and then starts again. I wanted to ask if there's a setting so I can change that might fix the problem or I should throw out  my laptop
17:58 <@deen> Mahdi: maybe your laptop overheats?
17:58 <@deen> Mahdi: my idea would be to enable vsync, set f1, cl_cpu_throttle 1 or 2, maybe set gfx_asyncrender_old 0 and gfx_threaded_old 0
17:59 <@deen> uchar: the .map method is the best. i imagine some people have favorite backgrounds, so they can just take a map, remove the game layers and just keep the background and play with that background in entities
18:00 < uchar> yeah i say that if you have Cl_Overlay.... 100 .. the quads aren't displayed and you need what group its background.map and what current.map
