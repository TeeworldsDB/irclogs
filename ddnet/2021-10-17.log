00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> anyone ever had a bug like this, for a mini second i have the input of the other player
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> happened to me a few times over the last year already(so not a new bug)
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and i remembered ppl said they were tagged by chat, even tho it wasnt their name that was tagged
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> I really wonder if thats a server or client bug
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but almost impossible to reproduce
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> had it like 5-10 times total maybe
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also im more often on kog or fng, but i can only remember this happening on ddnet
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe the cosmic rays are strong in my region ;)

01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good that i save shit like that, maybe teehistorian could find out, if the input was sent by the client
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i have the exact dates for all, the last one is maybe interesting, bcs it looks like my mate also has the bug(could also just be my client)
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Being tagged in chat with other names is super old and not too rare
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, in all my years in tw i never had it
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but this input copy bug a few times already
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Me neither. I would fix it if I could reproduce it
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> how does deepfly work? my dummy changes weapons half the time
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> cl_dummy_restore_weapon breaks deepfly sometimes
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> set it to 0
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Doggyfatman> @everyone
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Doggyfatman> this gift is for you bro
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Doggyfatman> http://discordc.gift/FGk23Djqo54s
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh wow thats a config nice thanks @murpi !!
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> works like a charm
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> :D
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> should be default imo also for normal hammer fly its very annoying that the dummy switches it mostly messes more up than it helps
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> does anyone else get a segfault when running a local server from master/staging and changing team?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, can reproduce
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> will fix
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nuborn> ah, ok
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> is the emote wheel broken in the beta?
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> seems like my cursor randomly jumps to the other siide sometimes
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> use nightly xd
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or maybe deen can update the RC with the fixed team joining @deen ?
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> wait
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> my server is crashing now
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh i see it was just fixed
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah thats why a new RC could make sense
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> image.png
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/899383688209522718/image.png
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> never seen bash crashing xD
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cosmic rays are really strong here
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt it nano's fault
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The RC is not even supposed to be out yet, I will try to write a changelog tomorrow
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if nano makes bash crash it's bash's fault I would say
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i guess
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think its probably due to ***
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think that's part of the error message
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess you hit tab and bash crashed somewhere within autocomplete, maybe due to a broken bash completion file
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its out on steam
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@deen)
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, i didn't expect so many changes
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@Learath2)
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats from the error message \:D
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@Chairn)
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> true \:D
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (@deen)
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tho i tried again afterwards and worked
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so really weird \:D
