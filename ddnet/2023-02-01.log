00:10 < bridge> <Izanagi> would it be helpful if there was an additional option like "Has people not playing", so it's more accessible to find empty maps?

08:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> TIL gentoo will use ninja if its installed automatically
08:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/proj/guru.git/commit/?h=dev
08:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> updated ddnet
11:19 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/proj/guru.git/commit/?h=dev&id=be0f3f7b9c0c74f1b1b9698c6ad5a938028a0823
18:11 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> @Ryozuki can I get data from ddstats from other websites?
18:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
18:19 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :thonk:

18:19 < bridge> <Chairn> Did you guys receive an alert on ddnet repo?
18:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> wdym?
18:38 < bridge> <Robyt3> The mail probably only went to team members
18:38 < bridge> <Robyt3> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/security/dependabot/2
18:44 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki fix rust
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but i think heinriich already said that we should just disable it
18:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this is heinrich doing
18:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but ye reading it it seems to be a windows only issue
18:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i dont think ppl run masterservers on windows
18:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also i would simply change warp to axum
18:45 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then do it
18:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> warp is no longer being updated iirc
18:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks i can look into it but its annoying
18:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cuz they want to keep it compat with debian
18:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i dislike old deps
18:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> true
18:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> just make rustup requirement
18:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and use rust 1.67 or whatever is current
18:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we dont even use rust 2021 edition
18:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> we are stuck with 2018
18:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> considering how even today i again ran in an unstable feature it must be horrible to use 2018 edition xD
18:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
18:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u and ur weird stuff
18:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i just type stuff, press `.` look at the suggested functions, find exactly what i want
18:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks

18:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> unstable feature
18:50 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do u agree with heinrich import style
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i let vscode do it xD
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> never touched it
18:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
18:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> vscode does it nice
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1070401068892180511/image.png
18:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno looks like its readable
18:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye
18:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nvm i wont even try
18:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> axum requires 2021
18:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and 1.60 i think
20:08 <+ChillerDragon> can someone explain me what is happening here?
20:08 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1675278498.png
20:10 <+ChillerDragon> running single commands with ``zsh`` runs the zshrc but its environment variables get overwritten by the one launching zsh?! Xd
20:12 <+ChillerDragon> -c is to run a single command and -i is for interactive so it loads the rc file
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1675278846.png
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXD it gets even better
20:14 <+ChillerDragon> the zshrc is run but the ``echo``command ignores the variable being set
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> but if the command is launching ``bash`` it gets the variable set in the ZSHRC xfcacfrxuaxzugaguixaxw
20:15 <+ChillerDragon> this is worse than javascript ngl
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> but ofc only if the bash is a interactive process in a single command bash also inherits from its grand parent xd
20:17 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1675279028.png
20:18 <+ChillerDragon> what a master piece 
20:21 < bridge> <RafaelFF> You are running bash and then started Zsh. The variable TEST is evaluated before the zsh command is run. So, before running zsh, before reading zshrc, the variable TEST was already set with "bash".
20:21 < bridge> <RafaelFF> 
20:21 < bridge> <RafaelFF> You command was the same as: `zsh -ic "echo $TEST"`, because de variable was already set.
20:27 < bridge> <RafaelFF> I think because you used `-i` flag, you executed the `echo $TEST` command and then entered zsh's shell. Otherwise would execute the issues command and quit back to bash
20:29 < bridge> <RafaelFF> Try
20:29 < bridge> <RafaelFF> 
20:29 < bridge> <RafaelFF> 
20:29 < bridge> <RafaelFF> ```
20:29 < bridge> <RafaelFF> export TEST=bash
20:29 < bridge> <RafaelFF> zsh -c "echo $TEST"
20:29 < bridge> <RafaelFF> echo $TEST
20:29 < bridge> <RafaelFF> ```
20:32 < bridge> <RafaelFF> Theorically this should not enter zsh, causing the last echo command to return bash

21:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh yea haha ofc Iâ€™m so stupid. Thanks \:D
21:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@RafaelFF)
21:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So I assume with single quotes it would print ZSH and then it all makes sense
21:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I wrote way too much bash to not see something like that instantly .\_.

22:17 < bridge> <Alexander> when hud icon for locked team indicator
22:17 < bridge> <Alexander> would be kinda useful
22:20 < bridge> <Izanagi> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6030
22:20 < bridge> <Izanagi> it's still open
22:20 < bridge> <Alexander> why is there always an open issue when i have a suggestion
22:21 < bridge> <Alexander> makes it look like im constantly trying to steal ideas
22:22 < bridge> <Izanagi> :kek:
22:22 < bridge> <Izanagi> but yes, i would like to come back to this to. Has anyone from the dev team made thoughts about how to implement this?
22:23 < bridge> <Izanagi> but yes, i would like to come back to this too. Has anyone from the dev team made thoughts about how to implement this?
22:46 < bridge> <Voxel> maybe in the player list (tab) there could be a lock next to the team number
22:47 < bridge> <Alexander> even better in my opinion
23:12 < bridge> <Ravie> cool idea for the future scoreboard redesign if that's still in plans
