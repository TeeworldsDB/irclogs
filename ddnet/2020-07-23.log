12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rubenw01> Hey guys ðŸ™‚
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rubenw01> I have an problem with the DDNet Client.. since i changed my game skin the mouse cursor in the game (outside its working fine) isnt working then I start the DDnet CLient so I always have to close the client and restart and then it works..  I have to restart the Client every time since I changed the game skin.. so there must be a problem or?
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rubenw01> this is the one.. i deleted the old one and named this one "game"
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rubenw01> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/735801372531753020/game.png
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rubenw01> Does anybody have an idea what could be the problem?
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <rubenw01> The problem with the in-game also appears then I update the client.. (also before the new skin)
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ChillerDragon: I'm afraid the answer is yes. Same with the earlier pic :justatest:
