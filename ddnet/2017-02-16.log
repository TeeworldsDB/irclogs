17:22 < Learath2> i seem to get horrible fps on my laptop which doesnt make any sense since tw runs fine on a toaster
17:22 < Ryozuki> mmm
17:22 < Ryozuki> what's ur cpu?
17:23 < Learath2> i7 4700MQ
17:23 < Ryozuki> and it runs bad? lol
17:24 < Learath2> yeah horrible even
17:24 < Ryozuki> andwhat is the cpu usage?
17:24 < Ryozuki> when playing
17:25 < Ryozuki> or maybe your hdd is being used a lot
17:25 < Ryozuki> idk
17:25 < Learath2> 4% cpu usage
17:25 < Ryozuki> a restart fixed it?
17:25 < Ryozuki> xD
17:25 < Learath2> no its still running horribly
17:25 < Ryozuki> tryied another copy?
17:26 < Ryozuki> makes no sense
17:26 < Learath2> Ryozuki: if i offload the graphics to the Nvidia gpu with DRI_PRIME it works fine
17:29 < Learath2> will give vanilla a try
17:30 < Ryozuki> i don't have a nvidia gpu :/
17:30 < Learath2> well doesnt matter sinde it works fine with that one
17:35 < Learath2> its borderless window which ruins it
17:42 < Learath2> also we broke something while switching to sdl2 my mouse feels jittery on ddnet but not on vanilla
17:42 < Ryozuki> ye mouse changed
