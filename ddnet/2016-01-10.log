21:23 < teemobile> hi
21:25 <@deen> hi teemobile 
21:34 < Ameb> deen: remember when u asked me for a pull request when i talked about irc visibility? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/pull/3#event-510577977 :(
21:34 < Ameb> well. Not asked, more like "suggested"
21:35 <@deen> Nope, I don't remember, oops^^
21:36 <@deen> Your PR is a bit strange anyway, it changs many other things as well
21:37 <@deen> I'll add it from your PR, thanks
21:38 < Ameb> i prolly messed with git
21:38 < Ameb> made it right the first time but email was wrong and not related to my github account
21:38 < Ameb> then i removed local, cloned again etc
21:43 <@deen> ok, added
22:35 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vupmL
22:35 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master ac61c8f def: Format cl_showid a bit nicer
22:51 < Ameb> Im thinking on a way to integrate map testing on map testing subforum and website
22:54 < Ameb> First sync forum attachments with the interface, so u can have a history of maps when theyre on testing phase. Sync comments with forum, and maybe accounts so testers opinion can be measured in some way
22:56 <@deen> that sounds very complicated
22:57 <@deen> the main problem with map testing is just that no one wants to put time into it and it's very time-intensive
23:01 < Ameb> Another idea is about adding a tutorial map running in a local server. Isnt the actual client able to start a local server?
23:01 < Ameb> Would be nice to integrate a way to start server with given config
23:01 < Ameb> so u can test the maps while mapping, or use it for the tutorial map
23:24 <@deen> what kind of tutorial map?
23:24 <@deen> tutorial for playing or for mapping?
23:39 < Ameb> for playing
