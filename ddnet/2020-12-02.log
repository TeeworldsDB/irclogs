02:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i want them see other a skin existing in database instead of default if they no have my skin
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> im 100% sure that just replacing default.png with another image would work
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> same for ninja skin
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i do it this
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> result= i see him other skin but still they see me default
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> result= i see them other skin but still they see me default
02:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> you cant force other people to use a different default skin
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> lmao
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> so put update for this or some thing
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i say this than beginning
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> but its dumb
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> and useless
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> this would be a terrible update
02:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> basically you force people to download any skin you want
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> not any skins
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> if you want people to see you as a different skin just use that skin
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> skin in datebate
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> just i want coice datauflt
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> just i want choice datauflt
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> then use the skin in the database
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i want use my skins but not want players see me default
02:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i know they not see my skin but at least i want  they see skin good not default yellow ugly:_:
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ok what skin do you want others to see you as
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> replace redbopp.png with ur custom skin
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> yeah
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> and then use redbopp
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> then other ppl see u as redbop
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but u also see other redbopps as ur custom skin
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> nouis
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> Colo-Colo:
02:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> acqwerty:
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Kenzoo go back to t0 skipping
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> no
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> uis
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> just wanted steal r1 from br guy
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> br guy stole r1 from me
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> thx
02:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kenzoo> ))
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> anyway i go try learn make skin with inkscape again🥱
03:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> inkscape is easy
03:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> it annoys me that there is no shape drawing tool in gimp
03:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> even paint has it lmao
03:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> why Layers are hidden😴
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> dont use layers
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> objects are like layers itself
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> I got used to it
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> you can view them in **object/objects..** tab or something
03:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ye but not using layers should be rather easier
03:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> Yes, I saw that, but it's just  this not basic thing = stupid thing for me
03:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> It is really beautiful and good but complicated, difficult to remember where things are
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i learn some things before just a week and now i can't remember how show layers and make circle empty inside
03:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> if you want to hide a single object then go that that tab that i wrote ealier
03:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> and if you want to make emty circle then just draw only outline without a fill
03:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> but the ask how??
03:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> right click the circle and there sbould be **outline and fill** option or something
03:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> then you can set it up
03:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> and just go to the fill section and select fil type as none
03:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> should have x icon
03:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> nope i still not find but thanky anyway
03:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :CRAZY:
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> gimp: best brushes
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3>  inkscape: best colors
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
03:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3>  photoshop: best in everything but its have  pixel:_:
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i trough that there are vectors in photoshop

05:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>   * This release of gcc-mingw-w64 changes the 32-bit exception handling
05:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>     mechanism from SJLJ to Dwarf2, to match MSYS2, Fedora, and other

05:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>     cross-compilers.
05:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪>     This will require rebuilding all artifacts built with previous

05:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
05:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if that matters for the 32bit version, atleast sqlite works with exceptions ^^
07:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i now discovered i can change my skin in demo  record too until:troll:

08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 did you wake up at 5 to snag points on the global leaderboard? 😄
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sure 😉
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it's 6
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a good excuse to get a sleep rhythm acceptable for society once a year 😉
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I woke up at 7, couldn't fall back asleep so I did todays challange instead 😛
08:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> gj btw, 32p is actually quite amazing given how many golfers are around in actual american time 😛
08:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ty ❤️
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh, you get more points by finishing it earlier?
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the first one to get a star gets a 100 points, the second one 99 and so on
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh well, I used sh today as my programming language of choice 😄
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did python again to get more used to it
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seems we won't be able to avoid python very soon, might aswell be good with it

10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> madman
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u cant index str directly in rust cuz they are encoded in utf8 :monkalaugh:

10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Not even going to lie... I didn't know we had to do it in code so I figured it all out by hand and in my head .-. took 40 minutes to figure it out XD I did it on my twitch
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he surpassed everyone and did it by head
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen I challange you to use a different language for each day :D
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen I challenge you to use a different language for each day :D
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro that's already what I'm trying to do 😄
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but it will get harder since I guess the tasks will be more difficult and I'll run out of languages I know well
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> awesome
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm learning rust so I'm doing everything in rust
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used regex as I was already too late to get any points for it, might aswell do it right
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I used regex and had a typo: `(\d)+`... instead of `(\d+)` and searched like 20 minutes for the problem
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aw
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did just (\d) for a second, didn't know the numbers could get larger than 10 :P
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I guess thats the same
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> But I thought I had it right and never looked back at the regex, also the typo was only for the first number ^^
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oof
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Hand checked ~10 entries all were right xD
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had an issue with parenthesis in the second half, I copy pasted the previous one so ended up with `pw[pos1] == char != pw[pos2] == char`
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> uh, idk about precedence there
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> By luck I also had like the first 7 as False, so it took oddly long to figure out :D
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm implementing a FIFO for uni, how should I name my variables?
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> > Head or tail first
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> > 
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> > The ends of a FIFO queue are often referred to as head and tail. Unfortunately, a controversy exists regarding those terms:
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> > 
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> >     To many people, items should enter a queue at the tail, and remain in the queue until they reach the head and leave the queue from there. This point of view is justified by analogy with queues of people waiting for some kind of service and parallels the use of front and back in the above example.
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> >     Other people believe that items enter a queue at the head and leave at the tail, in the manner of food passing through a snake. Queues written in that way appear in places that could be considered authoritative, such as the operating system Linux.
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have no idea about precedence in python either
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <! Foxi Tee> ddnet its in .php
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <! Foxi Tee> ?
12:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro fwiw I always add items at the head, pop them from the tail
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I agree, would have done it like that as well. Just saw some code doing it the other way around and it confused me ^^
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh and the 4-5 queue implementations I wrote were all deque wrappers instead, just to save time usually
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Write a deque once and you get both a fifo and a lifo queue :P
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> On a deque you can push and pop on both sides?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Actually you should name your variables `pushPointer` and `popPointer` or smth similar
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Thats unambigious
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Thats unambiguous
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> maybe the underlying container should be chosen based on the size of each stored elements?
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> std::vector for tiny elements
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> std::deque for larger ones
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> std::list for huge ones
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but that's overengineering probably 😄

15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> damn
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> need someone to carry me for getting advent of code input again
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Abner360> Louis are you the dev of ddnet?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @louis https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/java/how-to-split-a-string-in-java.html
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oo thanks
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Abner360> Who is the dev?
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/graphs/contributors
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> def- is deen, oy is the lead teeworlds dev which ddnet was forked from
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> GreYFoX and btd ported ddrace to 0.6, and maintained it afterwards
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> deen forked ddnet after a bit and maintained it since then, Learath2 added 0.7 support
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And @heinrich5991 added lots of stuff too, no running away from responsibility 😄
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> :ddnet: suggestion:ddnet: 
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> mitigation crowding the skins 
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> (put one inside and if i click above appears 
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3>  the  other skins colors  there   like this)
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> result this=
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 1-more  tidy  and easier for see
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 2-makers the skins can make more than one for same  a skin 
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> with other color or design without been haveing problems
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 3- two   enough XD

15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @hussainx3 you want to group skins by their dominant color, is that correct?
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> yeah i think
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :ddnet: suggestion:ddnet: 
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> 
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> Update ddnet skin system to 0.7 skin system
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> 
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> result = everyone happy
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :feelsamazingman:
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Souly would unfortunately kill all those old skins. I don't think that's an option
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> and server would need to send more info, right?
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i didnt check the code difference but i think that it would be rather problematic
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that's nothing impossible
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> aldo i started to port few 0.6 skin to 0.7
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> for now i have redcoke, mermydon and evilwolfe
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> now im trying to port kintaro_@
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> now im trying to port kintaro_2
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> suggestion
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> 
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> group skins by prefix
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> could we get a option to specify tee while using say command. So that one in local console can send a chat message from main or dummy tee.
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> well i guess ``cl_dummy 0;say foo;cl_dummy 1`` works well enough
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> cl_dummy 1; say dummy
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> y
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> it does a switch tho
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> who this? he say this suggestion before me?:what:
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 🥴
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> vote guys
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> 👻
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wats TSA
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> @deen i hate to keep pointing this out but now you are inconsistant :/
19:33 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1606933899.png
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> also use -print0 for pylint pls .-.
19:34 <+ChillerDragon> we could also go with the more readable version i guess but we should use the same for all
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @deen   can help me to upload my suggestion on website  suggestions of ddnet?:sendhelp:
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> is there a way to get rid of kill protection through a map's settings?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nope
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @anyonewhoknowshowfuckingenvelopesworkpleaseineedinformation
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So, I wanted to know if it is possible to make a day/night cycle using envelopes that is synced between clients, no matter when the client was started, the server was joined or when the tee touched the start/finish line.
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is that possible? (Notice: My server is playable from 0.7 and 0.6 (DDNet only, not vanilla))
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just press synchronize
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> wouldnt work for 0.7 clients
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> then idk
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> isnt envelopes based on server time
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> fully
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> I think it gets reset to its default state when you cross start line
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> if it synced
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> if it is synced
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> that's going without sync i guess
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Nope, see https://discord.com/channels/407308363031117832/490150878934990850/783809115881078805
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ravie for a dummy map or what?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> thanks, it's too hard to get it 😄
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @deen I have a minigame map that starts you with a bunch of time and it's annoying to reset
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen maybe kill protection should not be checked for race time but for alive time of the character, or we just make kill protection an option for maps
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ravie for fun server? We could just disable kill protection on fun server
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think on fun server no need for kill protection, I'll disable it
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> works for me :D
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> @fokkonaut try to check mrpg
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> on 0.7
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i feels like they had day night detection and day night cycle on map
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i feel like they had day night detection and day night cycle on map
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea they dont use startlines so they wont modify the gamestart tick
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i abuse it and that fucks it up, so i dont understand why ddnet does get fucked up by that
