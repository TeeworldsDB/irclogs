00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `// trying to set client name can delete the player object, check if it still exists`
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how? @deen
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I actually don't know how to make this correctly without it being very ugly
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hm
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm also wondering if we can just assume the asan headers to be there
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's one more dependency I guess
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or if you know more preprocessor magic than me you can give it a try
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, now that I think about it that branch there is there even if no asan, which is bad too
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, might want to ifdef that away entirely
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, you're inside of a macro already, fun ðŸ˜„
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Tell me if I should try to fix it up (probably tomorrow)
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why do you need to make sure you don't poison the same twice?
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The first poison is to poison the entire pool, couldn't find another way to do it
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I did make an attempt, if you want to take a look, not very pretty though
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah
00:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> using a global static initializer?
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think that's the cleanest way
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen um, idk how
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I pushed the ugly mess I came up with, if you don't like it I guess you can try tomorrow
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `static int dummy = (some_function(), 0);` is what I've seen a few times
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (packed up into a macro)
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah but asan works with shadow memory, it's not actually initializing the pool itself with sth from what I know
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> might be wrong though
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll push my version
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª>  To enable continue-after-error, compile with -fsanitize-recover=address and then run your code with ASAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=0.
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i use that
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is that too bad?
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh ok
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> problem is when you use-after-free with heap memory we could be doing an illegal access, causing the os to kill us
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mh, thought it recovers it
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Pushed, good night
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, don't merge that though
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It looks good but it's missing one thing
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> needs an alignas(8) somewhere
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I'm just way too tired actually
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so it'll have to wait :/
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice do we upgrade to c++17 now? \:D
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe\_unused
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, right
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah right lets upgrade xdd
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> \_\_has\_include() also c++17
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh not even just alignas, it needs to be padded :/
01:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't actually know how to :/
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, I know how, but idk how to do it pretty ðŸ˜›
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll pass out, night
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> night
07:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good morning

14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lol, thats actually amazing \:D
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thansk \:)
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> was a pain in the ass to drag the sub forks with in sorting

14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> in case anyone wants to go through the effort of instaling it
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just leave a todo someday
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> might be interesting for bigger projects \:D
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> sadly github caps everything it can including hughe fork networks

14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> these diffs \:o
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> just linux things
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on a completly different lvl
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont use chrome
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so i wont install it
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> btw does plasma per sec 0 mean always plasma?
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> e.g. 50 plasma per second would already be every tick
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> now with my change it does
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> previously it was division by 0, so who knows
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we can also make 1 the minimum
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i dunno how it even end up being 0, but i dont want to break anything xD
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i had it set to 0 in my config, not sure why
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah so its only on local server? \:D
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don'T know if mappers used it
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> good ^^
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> at least we had no crashes in the last days on official servers, finally
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sounds great, good asan found some stuff
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> more than i wanted ðŸ˜„
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> true, but the more stable it is now, the easier it is to revert future bugs without breaking everything xD
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen here?
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hi
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do you start the discord bot?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It seems to have no parent, so I'm guessing you use a systemd script or sth
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `nohup target/release/ddnet-discordbot &` probably
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah I see
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only the bot wouldn't break every 10 minutes ðŸ˜›
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen before merging the pool poison thing you also need to pad the objects to multiple of 8 bytes :/
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I thought you said you know how to do that ðŸ˜‰
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The C++17 switch didn't work anyway
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Um, I do, let me try
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen does that look acceptable?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Ryozuki\: yea true i also use firefox haha how to write firefox extensions?
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 is there actually a `send_or_paste` function or did you make that function up? ^^
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> chillerragon: something like that feels like it can just be a userscript
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and userscripts can also be used as extensions directly in some browsers
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga it should be somewhere in the moderator cog iirc
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> idk about user scripts i always used bookmarklets to directly run javascript. But a chrom extension is also only one js file and a manifest json
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 I don't see such a function, but I guess checking manually is fine too
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `cogs/admin.py:L36` @Patiga
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh nice, was looking for such a function in the discord api docs, didn't know cogs where local
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> tho I don't think you can use it from there, so you might need to just copy it over ðŸ˜›
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh damn it actually uses a paste website
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜„
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm I think I'd rather send a txt file if its too long
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I host the paste site too
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but a txt file would work too
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks like its kinda the same
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://rustacean.net/more-crabby-things/animated-ferris.gif
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea idk why i thought its a chrome extension just stole it from a years old project. Seems like firefox has the same format and publishing to firefox is actually free while googles store is paid \:c
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Ryozuki)
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://www.instagram.com/kevingeeschmidt/
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 is rate limiting the reason why you ended up using the self-hosted paste service?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope I already had one, why use someone elses :P
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I think my ddnet-discordbot is no longer doing what is supposed to coz of rate limiting :<
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ok nvm
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 again took much longer than I anticipated. I think I did the stuff right, also tested it in my private server (not all branches, though hopefully enough)
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> got dinner now, will check on it later

A lot of the core Rubyists left for Shopify after the sale, and I'm sure Nat had a contract to stay on for X amount of time, where Microsoft would make no major changes. Now that this is expiring, I fully expect Microsoft to start making changes with the site that will appeal to large corporations, at the expense of what I would prefer, as an individual user. I guess time will tell.
