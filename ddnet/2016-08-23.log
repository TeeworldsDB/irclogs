11:20 <+Ryozuki_> !seen timakro
11:20 <@Nimda> I've last seen timakro 11 days, 19 hours, 40 minutes and 29 seconds ago in #ddnet saying "hi".
11:21 <+Ryozuki_> !help
11:23 <@deen> hi Ryozuki_ 
11:23 <+Ryozuki_> hi
11:23 <+Ryozuki_> i'm making a fifo bot with python
11:23 <+Ryozuki_> and remember the !seen
11:23 <+Ryozuki_> as it read logs it would be possible to make it ^^
11:24 <+Ryozuki_> i think
11:43 <@deen> cool, i think i also made a fifo bot some time ago
11:43 <@deen> well, the games in ddnet-scripts also work like that
11:48 <+Ryozuki_> i've made a command that it's a calculator, and you can use the python math module :o
11:50 <+Ryozuki_> https://github.com/Ryozuki/PyBot :P
11:52 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki_: you can take over the computer with that eval
11:53 <+Ryozuki_> mmm how exactly
11:53 <+Ryozuki_> running exit() doesn't work
11:53 <+Ryozuki_> if u want to test it come to my server
11:54 <@heinrich5991> __import__('subprocess').check_call('ls')
11:54 <+Ryozuki_> it says Result: 0
11:54 <+Ryozuki_> xD
11:54 <@heinrich5991> yes, it called the ls binary on your computer
11:54 <@heinrich5991> I can call any binary (and do a lot more)
11:55 <+Ryozuki_> on console i didn't see anything weird
11:55 <@heinrich5991> __import__('subprocess').check_output('ls')
11:55 <@heinrich5991> try that
11:55 <+Ryozuki_> oh
11:55 <+Ryozuki_> Python.py\\README.md
11:56 <@EastByte> never use eval
11:56 <+Ryozuki_> PyBot.py*
11:56 <@heinrich5991> what EastByte says
11:56 <@heinrich5991> especially not for user-given input
11:56 <+Ryozuki_> and what other way i can convert a string to a operation?
11:57 <+Ryozuki_> meh
11:57 <+Ryozuki_> i could filter out __import__
11:57 <@heinrich5991> that's the wrong approach. I did that because it was the easiest
11:58 <@heinrich5991> you can't filter out everything. a safe way of doing this would be parsing the expression yourself
12:01 <@heinrich5991> http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html
12:02 <@heinrich5991> that's a fun article I found a few years back
12:04 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki_: maybe something like this could work: https://newville.github.io/asteval/index.html
12:04 <@heinrich5991> (haven't researched whether it's safe)
12:04 <+Ryozuki_> ast.literal_eval(node_or_string)
12:04 <+Ryozuki_> python says that is safe
12:05 <@heinrich5991> yes, but that's just numbers and strings AFAIK
12:05 <@heinrich5991> so 1+2 doesn't work already
12:05 <@heinrich5991> oh, it does
12:05 <@heinrich5991> yea, then it should be fine
12:06 <@heinrich5991> but 1*1 already doesn't work
12:06 <@heinrich5991> so not very useful
12:06 <+Ryozuki_> yea :c
12:07 <+Ryozuki_> i'll try what u sent
12:09 <@EastByte> maybe there is some math lib you can use to parse and resolve the expression
12:10 <+Ryozuki_> asteval works perfectly thanks
12:10 <@heinrich5991> (you still have the problem that every user can DoS the bot, but at least they can't take over your computer anymore)
12:10 <+Ryozuki_> it also has functions from math module
12:10 <+Ryozuki_> hmm
12:11 <@heinrich5991> 2**2**2**16
12:11 <+Ryozuki_> that doesn't work
12:11 <+Ryozuki_> but 2**2 yes
12:12 <@heinrich5991> huh? it doesn't work? what happens?
12:12 <@heinrich5991> it should take up all of the CPU time
12:13 <+Ryozuki_> fck
12:13 <+Ryozuki_> why u didnt told me before xD
12:13 <+WolfAlex_> xD
12:13 <+Ryozuki_> oh fixed
12:13 <+Ryozuki_> but doesnt look like
12:13 <+Ryozuki_> it returns None
12:13 <+Ryozuki_> on the chat
12:13 <@heinrich5991> mh
12:14 <@heinrich5991> weird. anyway, it shouldn't be hard to craft an expression that takes ages to evaluate
12:14 <@heinrich5991> haven't seen that asteval protects against that
12:15 <+WolfAlex_> while True: pass
12:16 <+Ryozuki_> it loads cpu to 88% for 4 secs then returns none
12:17 <@EastByte> does asteval have some sort of time limit?
12:17 <+Ryozuki_> maybe
12:19 <+Ryozuki_> there is a way to limit python cpu usage?
12:20 <+Ryozuki_> if can be done from code even better
12:20 <@EastByte> how about leaving out the calc command instead :p
12:20 <+WolfAlex_> Ryozuki_: how does your getname work? xD
12:20 <+Ryozuki_> xd
12:20 <+Ryozuki_> on log
12:20 <+Ryozuki_> it has five : before ur name
12:20 <+WolfAlex_> ah
12:21 <+Ryozuki_> so i find each them until i get to the name and then a rfind for the : after ur name
12:21 <+WolfAlex_> what if i'm "wo:lf"
12:21 <+Ryozuki_> yep :s
12:21 <+Ryozuki_> but i don't know other way for the moment
12:23 <@heinrich5991> WolfAlex_: I don't think you can have a colon in your name on IRC
12:24 <+WolfAlex_> isnt this for teeworlds?
12:24 <@heinrich5991> oh
12:24 <@heinrich5991> I dunno
12:24 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki_: you can set a timelimit in the Interpreter constructor of asteval
12:26 <+WolfAlex_> heinrich5991: look at line 23+, for teeworlds :D
12:27 <@heinrich5991> =)
12:37 <+Ryozuki_> hmmm
12:42 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/v69Fx
12:42 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master d3f04a9 Dennis Felsing: Remove accidental code
12:51 <@deen> anyone tested the new CHN server yet?
12:52 <@deen> I set it up but no time to check if it's working^
12:55 <@heinrich5991> deen: what does testing that involve?
12:57 <@deen> playing there?^
12:58 <@heinrich5991> ah
13:00 <+WolfAlex_> XD Ryozuki_ 
13:00 <+Ryozuki_> omg xD
13:01 <+Ryozuki_> what u did
13:01 <+Ryozuki_> exactly
13:01 <+WolfAlex_> renamed myself to "; shutdown ;"
13:01 <@heinrich5991> haha
13:01 <+Ryozuki_> oh god
13:01 <@heinrich5991> I didn't even think about that direction
13:01 <+Ryozuki_> this is getting hard
13:02 <+Ryozuki_> i can filter that
13:02 <+Ryozuki_> or not
13:02 <@heinrich5991> btw, that's similar to what an SQL injection is, if you heard about that
13:02 <@heinrich5991> you can quote the player's names
13:02 <+Ryozuki_> didn't
13:02 <+Ryozuki_> oh
13:03 <@heinrich5991> (the same problem appears for the result of the calculation btw)
13:04 <+Ryozuki_> wolf come and try again
13:04 <+Ryozuki_> omg
13:04 <+WolfAlex_> x)
13:06 <+Ryozuki_> try again
13:46 <+Ryozuki_> is there a way to get name of someone with a id with fifo?
13:53 <@deen> probably not easily. maybe change the output format for log instead?
13:53 <@deen> with servers you can do "status" and parse that, but meh
13:56 <+Ryozuki_> to change the format i would needto change the server right? i want it to be compatible with standard ddnet server
13:56 <+Ryozuki_> ill try the status
13:57 <@deen> right
13:57 <@deen> well, maybe you can just make the output format more reasonable and then we can add it to standard ddnet too ;)
14:00 <+Ryozuki_> :o
14:04 <+Ryozuki_> deen what is actually the -2 on logs?
14:06 <@deen> "no player" or something
14:06 <@deen> maybe global server messages or team messages
14:06 <+Ryozuki_> [16-08-23 13:42:24][chat]: 0:-2:NAME: xD
14:06 <+Ryozuki_> oh maybe team chat 
14:07 <@deen> player with ID 0 writes to chat with ID -2, yeah, probably team chat
14:19 <+WolfAlex_> Ryozuki_: https://pastebin.com/0d2nFCQf
14:20 <+WolfAlex_> but does not work if the player got ": " in its name
14:32 <+WolfAlex_> Ryozuki_: i've changed (?P<PlayerName>.+) into (?P<PlayerName>.{,15})
15:07 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: https://eastbit.net/public/tw-webgl/?map=https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/dm1_0d2db620.map
15:07 <@heinrich5991> this doesn't work :/
15:07 <@deen> heinrich5991: what
15:07 <@deen> 's bad about uploading the html/js on your server?
15:08 <@heinrich5991> I'd have to do it. and update it when east releases a new version. mhhhh
15:08 <+WolfAlex_> deen: heinrich5991 then has to update manually
15:09 <@deen> and tw-webgl is commonly updated? did I miss the updates in the last 3 years?^
15:09 <@heinrich5991> :P
15:12 <+WolfAlex_> just in case :D
15:12 <@deen> especially for webgl running stuff from another server sounds dangerous for the user
15:13 <@deen> there are probably many webgl security vulnerabilities
15:14 <@heinrich5991> probably. but the browser shouldn't know that it's from a separate domain, it's just getting the map file from there
15:14 <@heinrich5991> but maybe it's still some cross-site restrictions at work here

15:15 <@heinrich5991> says the console
15:21 <@heinrich5991> ah, enabling cross-origin sharing for /teeworlds/maps/maps/*.map fixes the problem
15:22 <@heinrich5991> (link works now)
15:24 <@deen> cool
15:34 <@EastByte> Yep
16:10 <+Ryozuki_> heinrich5991 it pop ups a message saying failed to initialise webgl
16:11 <@heinrich5991> that's probably a problem on your side, or intentional behavior if you disabled webgl
16:11 <+Ryozuki_> hmm
16:12 <@heinrich5991> do you have noscript?
16:13 <@heinrich5991> what OS are you on?
16:13 <@heinrich5991> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=118957#p118957

16:16 <+Ryozuki_> using chrome
16:16 <@heinrich5991> what OS are you on?
16:16 <+Ryozuki_> and latest gpu drivers
16:16 <+Ryozuki_> windows 10
16:16 <@heinrich5991> mh
16:16 <+Ryozuki_> i also have ubuntu
16:16 <+Ryozuki_> didn't tried there
16:16 <@heinrich5991> it should also work on windows
16:16 <+Ryozuki_> well

16:16 <@heinrich5991> mh. no idea. I guess you can't load other webgl sites either?
16:17 <+Ryozuki_> hardware acceleration doesn't work?
16:17 <+Ryozuki_> hm
16:19 < Ryozuki_> fixed it
16:20 <@heinrich5991> cool
16:20 <+Ryozuki_> but i can't load other maps

22:35 < asd_> hey
22:36 <+asd_> I want create ddrace server but i can't. is there anyone who help me?
22:37 <@deen> asd_: hi
22:37 <@deen> asd_: what's the problem?
22:37 <@deen> and what do you want exactly?
22:37 <@deen> are you on windows? do you want to run a server to test your own maps?
22:37 <@deen> or are you on linux and want your server to be online for everyone forevermore?
22:38 <+asd_> I want to play my friend. I want to vote all maps. I can change maps through "autoexec_server" but it takes so long
22:39 <+asd_> I am using win 10
22:40 <+asd_> I entered "https://ddnet.tw/downloads/" this web site and downloaded ddnet client & server and maps and then what should i do?
23:03 <@deen> asd_: like this: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps
23:03 <@deen> You copy the DDnet-Server.exe to the maps directory and start it
23:03 <@deen> then you can vote
23:11 <+asd_> i did deen. Thank you very much. you are good man :)
23:12 <@deen> have fun :)
