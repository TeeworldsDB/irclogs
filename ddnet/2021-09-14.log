00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> github is so broken üòÆ
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> for some reason it doesnt show a commit correctly
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Auf Branch pr_minor_refactoring
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ihr Branch ist auf demselben Stand wie 'origin/pr_minor_refactoring'.
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but its uploaded
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf, i've never seen smth like this xD
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when i do git rebase --interactive HEAD~2 
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it shows the correct commit
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but locally i have a change
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah lol XD
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just ammended to the wrong commit
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> when computers are more intelligent than human xd
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> :justatest: :nobot:
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> whats next on the line, the ppl will love you for your features xD
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> without you, they would not be possible, probably! xd 
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> I don't know what might be useful, ctrl+f or a text translator, but I don't know a free service that will translate a message well
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you could create a stub for a text translator so its not shipped with ddnet
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> ü§î
01:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> I think it would be really cool to send messages from the command line (console) when the game is alt+tab xd
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah generally a chat only mode
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> i use ddnet only for chatting
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then we can also provide android builds again üòÑ
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> since u cant really play under android anyway
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> (on phone)
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> k
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> (okay)
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> why do teeworlds on the phone???
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> chatting xd
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> It's impossible to play on the phone, after all
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> maybe if you make a chat console for a PC, then you can do it for a phone
01:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> if you want deen to read all your messages then go ahead
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> or did you suggest the same thing I just didn't understand
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd add a chat mode, that e.g. automatically goes into spec and lets you chat easily
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> stuff like that
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> chatting and spectating
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> but
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> cant you just spec and then hit enter
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> on your phone?
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> without loading the graphic part? Do I understand correctly?
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> oh you on phones
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> with graphics
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. spec your friends and chat with them so they fail
01:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> would be too sick
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> and when new maps come out you can preview them on your phone
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> that would be a feature
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <WAV> or any map basically
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BloodWod-513> :sendhelp:
06:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> They are grouped like maps on ddnet
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> U need to vote for category(map length) and vote for any map
07:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robin720> oh sorry, there was always opportunity to change settings in settings of race maps. There was written long, medium and shrot. I am asking if this opportuinty was removed or where can i find it
07:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robin720> oh sorry, there was always opportunity to change settings of race maps in the call vote page. There was written long, medium and shrot. I am asking if this opportuinty was removed or where can i find it
07:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robin720> oh sorry, there was always opportunity to change settings of race maps in the Call Vote page. There was written long, medium and shrot. I am asking if this opportuinty was removed or where can i find it
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That's just something done with cfg files adding different votes
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'm only keeping the last 2 weeks on https://ddnet.tw/stats/master/ now for space reasons. (But I keep a backup of the old ones)

10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2800
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 16:00 by ?
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> +3?
10:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> utc i guess
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so 18:00 in europe
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> germany
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> üßê
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Probably yeah
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> making it paralel was as ez as adding .par_iter() xd
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/887252519414280222/unknown.png
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> before it took more than minutes
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @Ryozuki can u teach me how to add libs into projects, i have no clue how to properly add library linking and compiling into cmake
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no sry
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i value my time xd
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u probs are on windows
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which is even worse
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I use both, but when smth work on one system, it doesn't on other
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u mean non ddnet here is how i made it for sdl back long ago https://edgarluque.com/blog/sdl2-cmake
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its not how ddnet does it
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just look how other libs are included
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats how i learned to do it
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> okay:feelsbadman:
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @uwu https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2139
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the last time i added a library
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Okay i will look into it:greenthing:
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @Ryozuki btw can u recommend smth about threads, i already read some articles and docs but still have no clue how to manage them
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> And also what if i want to add lib that uses c++17, i tried to switch version but ddnet dont want to work
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Do i need to look for other lib for older version or i can do smth about it?
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Actually it's probably CEST we're using, local time on all ddnet servers for convenience
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> google > cppreference > threads
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> standard library or external?
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> generally there is
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> `set_property(TARGET ${target} PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 11)`
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but for some reason also `-std=gnu++11`
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> external
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you link that library?
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> added to the linker?
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :justatest: Probably
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> what is your error then
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> It uses <> include for own files and <> goes to src/ folder
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Not to its own
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Iclude one
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Include one
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then you need to add the include path
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkaS:
12:16 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon https://matrix.org/blog/2021/09/13/vulnerability-disclosure-key-sharing
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> one day I will sit down and figure out how matrix works
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I can't join any chat or smth there either
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> its a long time since I've seen the ddnet bot print debug info for maps, was that turned off or is it perhaps broken @Learath2 ?
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I would expect some maps to have some stuff it doesn't like, but its been weeks since I saw a message from it
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Paul> Ok i did
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Paul> (@uwu)
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> What the fuck i can record voice messages here
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> U should make a voice message saying that to prove
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I probably will when i will be free:monkaS:
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> Nice
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn‚Äôt touch it, maybe submit a broken map to check?
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> fair, seems to still be running. I'm pleasantly surprised then :)

14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @noby u might be interested in this voice message too:troll:
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> How can a zoomed target Position with dyncam with the calculation not be the position where the cursor is rendered Clientside? It matches on zoom 10 but not for other zoom levels. It works without dyncam too xd
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> my guess is because the screen moves into the direction of the cursor in dyncam, but on zoom 10 (1.0) it works too, no idea why the same thing wouldnt work with other zoon levels then
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe your calculation for the zoom level is off
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, its not
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it works without dyncam, and also with until the range where the screen starts moving in direction of the cursor
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Then maybe your calculation for the dyncam on the server side is off due to the follow factor?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Probably, but i cant know what follow factor the client has. I tried some maths but i could not get it to be perfect
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I'd guess the position sent from the client would have already considered the follow factor
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yea
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats why its so weird
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HamidReza> what is distance in name_ban
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Levenshtein distance
