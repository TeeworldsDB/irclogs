09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> is there a way to use a  key instead of "Enter" for sending messages?
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> another key for chat messages?
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i think no]
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you can bind a whole message
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but i could be wrong
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bind x say foo
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> my friend's enter is broken he cant bind XD
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you dont need enter to bind xd
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but if his enter is broken i would remap it in the os not in teh applicatiopn
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> both return and enter should work
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sacrafire the f3 nobody needs it anyways
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> if theyre separate keys
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> i see , thanks

09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> lel
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> another one bites the dust
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> How does he get so much attention without any proof? I mean it is censored so it could be faked in paint. Also a fresh twitter profile as far as i can tell.
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dareka> thought about it too, but i hope no one would do such boring thing
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> the game lags really hard when you use aimbind on the server im on right now
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> is it some kind of bug?
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what/who is an aimbind?
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> to aim straight up/right etc
14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> changes mouse max distance
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> it sets mouse max distance to 1 so you can only aim in 45Â° angles
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, it doesn't "lag" for me
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it doesn't work too well either, but I have no idea how it's supposed to work to begin with ðŸ˜›
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dingus> i thought people were chatting ultra quickly instead of binds
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bre3kAcHu> @Learath2 it also slows down your mousesens to a minimum so you can do it precisely
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <raNYnighty> How can i fix a problem when ddnet settings are resetting all the time i start  it?
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @raNYnighty you should look what the file "ddnet_settings.cfg" does . It should save your settings when you change something and load it again when you launch the client again.
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <raNYnighty> yeah i know
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <raNYnighty> but it doesnt exist
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> where are you looking for it
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <raNYnighty> in game direction and in /appdata/roaming/teeworlds
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does your log show some errors @raNYnighty ?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 you know that you can simply click apply somehwere on github to get the suggested fixes instead of downing it agian ur self locally -.-
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't like committing online
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its best ðŸ˜ƒ
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it desync's my local copy
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <raNYnighty> how to check log?
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> git pull
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but at that point i was already working on something
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> start client form commandline @raNYnighty
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so that git pull wouldn't have gone as smoothly as you imagined
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> git stash pop rebranch
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ez
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rebase
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> interactive
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wizard 1337
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> at that point i might just `stash, checkout, fix, push, pop`
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not everyone is as good in git as you chiller
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikr i sometimes forget :troll:
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> tbh i just need the fame from githubs credits
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 why not use c as prefix for color arguments?
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> i will
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that patch only does player_color_body and player_color_feet, those are config variables
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why only these?
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> at least do dummy_color_x too then xd
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <raNYnighty> 
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <raNYnighty> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/570967123241861140/unknown.png
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and when you close clien
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what does it say at the end?
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any error saving the settings file?
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <raNYnighty> nothing
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmm
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> if you edit the settings manually? does it load it?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can you show the full output
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> paste it in irc pls :troll:
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <raNYnighty> if i edit i cfg
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <raNYnighty> it saves
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oke so it seems like the writing fails. So there could/should be some error while closing the client i guess..
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <raNYnighty> https://pastebin.com/M69A7euX
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uhm
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that doesnt look comeplete to me
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i usually get a 
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``[2019-04-25 15:54:12][client]: disconnecting. reason='unknown'``
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> on closing the client
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no matter if i am ingame or not

15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> no
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the command is cl_confirm_disconnect_time
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ya after the update it changed and the old version didnt disappear magically
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but that doesnt break anything
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> k
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ikuk
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it was only one small version with the command being that
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh btw fokko if you edit storage.cfg it is a custom cfg ... thats what editing means it is customizing it
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> releated to my ddnet issue
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> didnt want to spamm more useless comments
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ???
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ofc it is customazition
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why did you tell me thatxd
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1676
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> your last comment sounded to me like you wanted to proof me wrong that you need the storage.cfg there how it is because you use the default one
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why is it bad to provide it by default
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how else would people know it's a thing
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dlls must be in the folder of the exe u can close the issue now
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thought so
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but its not only about dlls
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wow windows is cancer xd
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so many useless issues
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does nobody agree with me that the folder which you expect to hold a client and server binary and nothing else is a bit spammed?
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> every single app in windows does this
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/570973558931456000/unknown.png
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> close the issue
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what about tools?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> these .exes
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <raNYnighty> and if i delete a teeworlds folder from /appdata , ddnet-setting file did not appear
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> they require dlls too?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do they?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> idk
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah fak that would mean duplicated ddlls if you put them into another folder
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but dont think so
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its a stupid thing the one ur complaining about
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just take 2 secs to find the exe
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or simply use a symlink
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it could use a symlink to hide the dlls in abin folder
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gotttt
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bye
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon u should facepalm urself https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1677 and also pls think before doing issues and if they are useful at all
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and why did u do a pr if u think urself its bad too? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1674
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki this issue is clearly a personal problem i have and not bringing too much value probably. But i didnt know there is a quality minimum for issues. I thought they can be used for personal bug reports and solutions as well. So if others also get this problems they know how to fix it. Or maybe it could even be fixed in the repo.
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the pr was as i mentioned already to open i discussion. As a proof of concept to see what is possible. And i decided to started and test it the way it was suggested.
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> " proof of concept to see what is possible" we already know we can render anywere on the client, what were u trying to proof?
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> proof it to me because i nveer rendered anything and i also realized that it is tricky to get the current weapon in freeze
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> about issue quality, i think its quite obvius they should bring something valuable if its a feature request
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> my HUD issue is not a feature request
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u wanted to proof us u can render on the client???
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean, why
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> chiller ur hud issue is invalid
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> that wasn't on a vanilla server
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> how do you define a vanilla server?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did u see my response?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> urs is clearly not a vanilla sv
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol?
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can see the killingspree message
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you should best know what is vanilla
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the server binary is offical 0.6.3
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> u vanilla fanboy
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont even know what vanilla means
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> the official server doesn't have any stats features
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nor killingspreees
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> this is an admin using rcon say and broadcast
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or kill spree
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ye sure
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> lol
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> automated tho
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but the server vbinary is vanilla
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no code changed
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we cant reproduce it anyway
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and that admin is stupid
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> true
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i will look into it and maybe try to find something if i dont find the solution i might close it anyway if it annoys u all im sorri
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah vanilla issues on ddnet client annoy me
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uff
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> did u try to debug it if u can reproduce it
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> as i said if i will find time i will look into it didnt had time yet
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> my client cant download ddnet info?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (i dont get the update 12.2/3)
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> also no news?
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i get this
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```

17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe some outdated cert idk?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe bcs i deleted that file some time ago xd
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will redownload it
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ya thats probably why it broke for me aswell
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> stop deleting the internet fokko
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ddnet.tw down?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cant reach
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i just use the file from my local ddnet repo

17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> meh
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can u reach https://info.ddnet.tw/info from browser?
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ofc not
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if i cant reach ddnet.tw xd
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i can lol
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes u
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> probably ddos and my provider got blocked again >.<
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i use vpn and im not blocked lel
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yay autoupdate works
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can reach ddnet.tw again
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @trml freeze prediction doesnt work if antiping is off
18:54 <+Learath2> heinrich5991 || deen: can you give me a hand with c++ being a pita? :P
18:59 <@deen> ?
19:01 <+Learath2> `ColorRGBA::ColorRGBA() is implicitly deleted because the default definition would be ill-formed:`
19:01 <+Learath2> I don't think I've ever seen that one before
19:02 <@deen> then just define it yourself instead of default-defining it
19:02 <@deen> I saw that just today at work :D
19:06 <+Learath2> deen: can you take a look at my color pr? just color.h for now, I don't write a lot of OOP code not really sure of the structure I chose
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why can't microsoft do something half decent every once in a while?...
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> why does their preprocessor behave like it's the exact one ritchie and kernighan used back in bell labs?...........
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyone familiar with the mess that is MSVC, please help me macro
19:13 <@deen> sure
19:13 <@deen> what's wrong with it?
19:13 <@deen> I wrote lots of standard compliant macros :D
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen https://ci.appveyor.com/project/def-/ddnet/builds/24101510
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> compiles on anything else I've tried it on
19:15 <@deen> yes, msvc is pretty strict
19:15 <@deen> and clang of course immitates gcc
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I'm guessing it has sth to do with `#define MACRO_CONFIG_COL(...) MACRO_CONFIG_INT(__VA_ARGS__)`
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably it's taking the standard very literally e.g. __VA_ARGS__ is one entire token
19:17 <@deen> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5134523/msvc-doesnt-expand-va-args-correctly
19:17 <@deen> exactly, you need this to do it
19:18 <@deen> we had the same thing in our code at work as a helper
19:18 <+Learath2> deen: do you think maybe I should just write the parameters out?
19:18 <@deen> and it's an "alternative interpretation" of the standard
19:18 <@deen> yes, that would be much clearer
19:18 <@deen> only use __VA_ARGS__ if you really need it
19:18 <@deen> for overloaded macros
19:19 <+Learath2> I don't understand why they would stick to their guns on this...
19:19 <@deen> doesn't matter much. anyone that uses variadic macros has this expand trick in their code base by now anyway
19:20 <@deen> I'd really prefer the colors to have proper types
19:20 <@deen> instead of just passing around vec4 everywhere
19:21 <+Learath2> deen: that's exactly what I did :P
19:21 <+Learath2> ColorHSLA and ColorRGBA
19:21 <@deen> but you also added the h, s, l accessors to vec3
19:24 <+Learath2> I can drop them all, i added them because it looked better and i inherited from vec3
19:24 <+Learath2> I could just not inherit from that
19:24 <@deen> well, it's ok
19:24 <+Learath2> that's why i asked if you could take a look at my color.h, I'm not really sure if the structure is good
19:25 <@deen> but stuff like HslToRgb doesn't use the types
19:25 <@deen> all just vec3
19:27 <+Learath2> Those will be replaced, I just kept them for a while so I could compile and test
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DjMYI/38fe745cd8.png
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i dont know how to debug
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> all my print messages get called
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but i still dont see the score in menu
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what u tryn to do
19:42 <+Learath2> deen: do you think it's a better idea to not inherit from vectors at all?
19:46 <@deen> not sure, do they have some nice methods you need?
19:47 <+Learath2> nope
19:47 <@deen> Then I don't see much use in deriving from vec
19:48 <+Learath2> the templates, I really don't remember what I was doing :P
19:48 <+Learath2> think I was just trying out template specialization, not much use when there isn't a definition for the generic case
20:07 <+Learath2> deen: I think I'll derive from vec to keep that union mess out of color.h I couldn't really figure out a decent way to do it
20:08 <@deen> ok
20:08 <+Learath2> e.g. ColorRGBA inherits from color4_base, color4_base should have the 4 components already
20:08 <+Learath2> afaik there is no way to rename and expose a parents members
20:17 <@deen> just don't inherit :D
20:17 <@deen> and ColorRGBA has r, g, b, a as members
