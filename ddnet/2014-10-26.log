00:21 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
00:22 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
00:45 <@deen> so we had a small ddos attack today
00:45 <@deen> but on the wrong server^^
00:45 <@deen> it was on GER1, where only ictf servers are running

09:04 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
09:06 <@heinrich5991> deen: why do you need that?
09:49 < EastByte> "so we had a small ddos attack today", "it was on GER1"
09:49 < EastByte> this
09:49 <@heinrich5991> you need to record connless packets for that?
09:49 <@heinrich5991> tcpdump can do that
09:49 < EastByte> it's for demo recording
09:52 < EastByte> heinrich5991: the gametype is only transfered over connless packets right?
09:53 <@heinrich5991> yes
09:53 < EastByte> and the demo player needs to now about it to show the race times in scoreboard instead of normal score
09:54 <@heinrich5991> is the ddnet message a game message perhaps?
09:54 < EastByte> what message?
09:55 < EastByte> do you mean the IS_DDNET message?
09:55 <@heinrich5991> yes
09:55 < EastByte> yes it is
10:08 <@heinrich5991> then check for the presence of that message, EastByte :)
10:11 < EastByte> I don't think it's usable for that
10:11 < EastByte> it's send from client to server independent from servertype
10:11 < EastByte> but adding such a gamemessage on recording start to the demo might be a solution
11:35 < Savander> hi
11:36 < EastByte> hi
12:30 < EastByte> deen: I think I know what the main problem of the ~10 second connect is
13:23 < Nimda> FWYS 1 by Ama just released on Moderate at 2014-10-26 13:23
13:23 < EastByte> huh?
13:40 <@deen> EastByte: yes?
13:40 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
13:40 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 301
13:40 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 532 users online at 2014-09-28 20:14:41
13:40 <@deen> so many players so early!
13:40 < EastByte> yea holydays :D
13:40 < EastByte> busy ingame
13:41 <@deen> oh right, forgot about holidays^^
13:42 <@deen> tournament servers started. I'll go afk for a while
13:44 <@deen> EastByte: why do the 10 second connect times happen?
13:44 <@deen> some firewall rule of yours?
13:44 < EastByte> Im ingame wat :D
13:44 < EastByte> wait*
13:57 < EastByte> deen: I'm first in FWYS 1 :)
14:25 < EastByte> deen: tell me when you are back
15:18 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
15:19 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
15:29 < EastByte> hello eeeeeeeeeeeee
15:47 <@deen> EastByte: back
15:48 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
15:49 < Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
16:06 < EastByte> deen: so
16:06 < EastByte> it's a fact that ovh starts throttling packets outgoing from server
16:07 < EastByte> and I think the reason is
16:07 < EastByte> the netmsg for adding vote lists
16:07 < EastByte> since it's being flooded on connect
16:07 <@deen> ah
16:07 < EastByte> we should balance it on multiple ticks
16:08 <@deen> yes, we should.
16:08 <@deen> it's a wonder it works :P
16:08 < EastByte> yea...
16:08 <@deen> the vote lists have grown so much
16:08 <@deen> i thought we would run into trouble much earlier
16:08 < EastByte> logging the netmessages I saw each votelist msg transmitted once per second
16:08 < EastByte> which takes about 10 seconds
16:11 <@deen> o_be_two: any problems with ddos attacks or did something else happen? I see an unusual amount of players on european ddnet block servers
16:11 < EastByte> so the votes are stored in a linked list
16:11 < EastByte> struct CVoteOptionServer { next, prev, description, command }
16:12 <@deen> yes
16:12 < EastByte> is it possible to remove voteoptions ?
16:12 <@deen> yes, i think so
16:12 < EastByte> meh
16:12 <@deen> oh
16:12 <@deen> but it doesn't work^^
16:13 < EastByte> okay good :)
16:13 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't work?
16:13 <@deen> it kind of works
16:13 <@deen> but not with weird utf8 characters
16:13 <@deen> just says "option ... does not exist"
16:14 < EastByte> so it should cause no trouble to step through the list from tick to tick?
16:14 <@deen> on ddnet no problem
16:14 <@deen> except maybe when a new map is just released
16:14 <@deen> then the vote list gets cleaned and reloaded
16:15 < EastByte> well that would be bad
16:15 <@heinrich5991> deen: teeworlds doesn't interpret utf8 stuff (afaik) it just treats it as byte sequence (except for displaying purposes)
16:15 < EastByte> we should use an index then?
16:15 <@heinrich5991> dunno why it should fail on utf8 which is not ascii
16:15 <@deen> heinrich5991: yes, so i thought. but i can delete vote entries that are ascii only but utf8 not
16:16 <@heinrich5991> how do you add/remove them?
16:16 <@heinrich5991> ingame?
16:16 <@deen> ingame i click on "Remove"
16:16 <@deen> in the votes menu
16:16 <@heinrich5991> ah
16:16 <@deen> it may just be the unicode space at the start of the vote name
16:17 <@deen> add_vote " ★★★★★ | 868 ⚑ | 1. hi_leute_gll & levi (07:21)" "info"
16:17 <@deen> this one fails
16:19 < EastByte> should I try working on it?
16:19 <@deen> yes
16:19 < EastByte> okay
16:19 <@deen> the reason is simple, probably
16:19 <@deen> network protocol filters out the spaces at start and end
16:19 <@deen> but server stores the entry with spaces
16:19 < EastByte> oh it does?
16:20 <@deen> I think so, because i don't see a space there^^
16:22 < EastByte> I'll add a SendVoteOptionIndex to the player and as long it's below NumVotes it will progress sending x votes per tick
16:22 <@deen> and i remember that chat messages used to do the same but i changed it there
16:22 < EastByte> on clear it'll be reset to 0
16:23 <@deen> will the client realize that a reset just happened
16:23 <@deen> ?
16:23 < EastByte> yea
16:23 < EastByte>  CNetMsg_Sv_VoteClearOptions
16:23 < EastByte> will be send then
16:23 <@deen> good
16:45 < EastByte> I hope ddosers will reach the right target today
16:45 <@deen> ^^
16:56 < Savander> tournament today?
16:56 <@deen> yes, 3 hours
16:56 < EastByte> yea
16:56 < Savander> ah :)
16:56 <@deen> brutal dummy map
16:57 < EastByte> well I only finished one brutal map so far^^
16:58 <@deen> Brutal maps are fun to watch
16:58 < EastByte> rly?
16:58 < EastByte> because everyone stuck in noobfilter?
16:58 <@deen> I think so, because the parts are really challenging
16:58 <@deen> You can see how pro the pros actually are
16:59 <@deen> no one has tried out amazon webservices frankfurt yet?
16:59 < EastByte> hmm
17:00 <@deen> I don't know if they have the same protection as in Ireland, that would be bad
17:00 <@deen> Would be interesting to know what ping, prize and protection they have
17:00 < EastByte> I thought amazon webservices is more about renting cpu cores over amount of time
17:02 <@deen> isn't that the same as a virtual server?
17:02 < EastByte> yes, sure
17:02 < EastByte> but about it's network stability
17:02 <@deen> yeah, no idea if it's fit for hosting a gameserver
17:02 < EastByte> ^
17:02 <@deen> that's why I'm curious
17:05 <@deen> got some information from nfoservers, but no response whether it's fixable yet
17:05 <@deen> but it sounds like Deutsche Telekom's fault =/
17:06 < EastByte> haha
17:06 <@deen> they're well known for doing weird routing like that if other networks don't pay to get connected to them
17:07 < EastByte> ...
17:07 <@deen> "It looks as though your ISP only connects to Cogent in Paris, which caused
17:07 <@deen> problems when the outbound chosen by Internap used Cogent. Currently, they are
17:07 <@deen> using GTT, and it looks much better"
17:07 < EastByte> One of the most hated companies I know
17:08 <@deen> so I live 100 km from Frankfurt, but get connected over Paris^^
17:08 < EastByte> ^^
17:15 <@deen> EastByte: do you think OVH's vServer Classic would work for ddnet.tw (website only)
17:15 <@deen> the 2.40 € thing
17:15 < EastByte> I'm rly not sure :/
17:16 <@deen> why not?
17:16 <@deen> my alternative would be Harmony Hosting for 5 €
17:16 <@deen> but they go down a lot^^
17:16 < EastByte> ^^
17:16 <@deen> any other suggestion?
17:17 <@deen> Needs some basic ddos protection, 1 core and cheap
17:17 <@deen> and probably located in europe
17:17 <@deen> 0.5 - 1 GB should be fine
17:18 < EastByte> you can take a look at the classic one
17:18 <@deen> hm, not sure how to test it except setting everything up
17:18 <@deen> have you been using/monitoring it?
17:18 <@deen> does it go down often?
17:18 < EastByte> no downtime yet
17:18 < EastByte> ~25 days
17:18 <@deen> if ping jumps up and it's laggy, that doesn't matter much for website i think
17:19 < EastByte> well
17:19 < EastByte> hm
17:20 < EastByte> I guess it should be enough for ddnet.tw since we don't have many visitors
17:21 <@deen> could also use KMS for 2.50: https://www.kms-hosting.com/vserver/
17:21 <@deen> at least has 1 gbit/s peak
17:21 <@deen> 100 mbit/s is already slower than some people home connection
17:21 < EastByte> hm I can't bypass the ddos gateway
17:21 <@deen> haha
17:22 <@deen> yeah, it's weird javascript stuff i think
17:22 < EastByte> ...
17:22 <@deen> the whole hoster is weird
17:22 <@deen> they haven't paid back the money for the server i bought
17:22 < EastByte> :P
17:22 <@deen> i only noticed when i saw that the server is still running...
17:23 <@deen> but i did everything exactly as described in their AGB so i should get the money back
17:24 < laxa> deen: there is no more link to upload demo on hall of fame :(
17:25 <@deen> oops^^
17:26 <@deen> fixed
17:33 < o_be_two> hey
17:33 < o_be_two> where is the ddnet-priv channel oO ?
17:35 <@deen> oh, ddmax is back
17:35 <@EastByte> heh
17:35 <@deen> and tsin says we shouldn't release any more ddmax maps
17:36 <@EastByte> grr :/
17:37 <@EastByte> what were the problems between ddnet & ddmax again?
17:37 <@deen> what problems?
17:38 <@EastByte> I thought splitting up from ddmax was the reason for ddnet
17:38 <@deen> yes, the people who started ddnet had permabans on ddmax
17:38 <@EastByte> ^^
17:38 <@deen> and wanted a place where they could play
17:40 <@deen> ah, Savander is hosting ddmax now
17:41 <@EastByte> lel
17:41 <@EastByte> Savander: betrayer!!!
17:41 <@deen> Savander was with ddmax the entire time^^
17:41 <@deen> not that that's any problem
17:46 <@deen> EastByte: if that surprises you, you may not have seen the ddmax admins: http://ddracemax.info/Pages/the_crew/
17:47 <@EastByte> ah laxa was talking about that but he wasn't sure whether he still is part of it
17:57 < Savander> deen
17:57 < Savander> started with ddnet
17:57 <@deen> hi
17:57 < Savander> but i don't have ban!
17:57 < Savander> YEA
17:57 < Savander> xD
17:57 <@deen> No one has ban^^
17:57 < Savander> and yes, i don't have any problems with ddnet or ddmax
17:57 < Savander> i just was i ddmax, and i want help ddmax soo :)
17:57 < Savander> now ddmax will be online on my servers
17:57 < Savander> but later i think
17:58 < Savander> tsin will have own
17:58 < Savander> i guess ^^
18:01 <@EastByte> maan I hate working with plain C linked lists
18:03 <@heinrich5991> +1
18:04 < Savander> ah yes
18:04 < Savander> you said "had"
18:04 < Savander> sorry
18:04 < Savander> :D
18:18 < Savander> Cool :D
18:18 < Savander> Someone ddosing me
18:18 < Savander> :)
18:19 <@EastByte> no one wants to ddos me :(
18:25 < Savander> any commands to check network traffic?
18:25 <@EastByte> nload is a simple traffic monitor
18:25 <@EastByte> and you can dump traffic using tcpdump
18:26 <@EastByte> which is hard if you lost access to the server :)
18:26 < Savander> but
18:26 < Savander> i still have
18:26 < Savander> but really bad
18:26 <@EastByte> bad is more then enough
18:26 <@EastByte> run "tcpdump -w shortdump.cap"
18:26 <@EastByte> and stop after ~5 seconds
18:27 <@EastByte> analysing the dump I even can tell you whether my server could've been affected by the attack :)
18:31 < Savander> http://pastebin.com/nc17bNiF
18:32 <@EastByte> yea now share shortdump.cap :)
18:32 < Savander> ehm?
18:32 < Savander> :D
18:32 < Savander> aah
18:32 <@EastByte> you have fileaccess I guess
18:36 < Savander> https://www.mediafire.com/?oangnp7rfplj3bi
18:36 < Savander> https://www.mediafire.com/?oangnp7rfplj3bi
18:36 < Savander> sorry, but impossible to share it from vps
18:36 <@EastByte> by share I mean just upload it
18:37 <@EastByte> but you shouldn't share it in this public channel
18:37 < Savander> Ahm
18:37 <@EastByte> since the dump might contain tw rcon pws
18:37 < Savander> rly!?
18:37 < Savander> LOL
18:37 <@EastByte> it's a network dump?
18:37 < Savander> ye
18:37 <@EastByte> all traffic in there
18:37 < Savander> i think yes
18:37 < Savander> i did it
18:37 < Savander> "tcpdump -w shortdump.cap"
18:37 <@EastByte> well but only 5 seconds
18:37 < Savander> ye
18:37 < Savander> its 5 seconds
18:38 < Savander> or maybe 1 second more max 6
18:39 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: can you take a look at it?
18:39 <@EastByte> a little bit weird
18:39 < Savander> okay?:o
18:39 <@EastByte> ehm what's the ip?
18:44 <@EastByte> nah doesn't look like ddos
18:45 < Savander> meh
18:45 < Savander> so you think, it's problem with network inside?
18:45 < Savander> ;/
18:45 < Savander> (filemedia) ;/
18:48 <@EastByte> afk
18:52 < Savander> 148.42 GB of 2 TB Used / 1.86 TB Free
18:52 < Savander> xD
18:52 <@deen> Wow, livestream already running on ddnet.tw
18:52 <@deen> 1 hour before tournament!
18:53 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: take a look at what?
18:54 < Savander> heinrich5991: 
18:54 < Savander> at this [18:36] <Savander> https://www.mediafire.com/?oangnp7rfplj3bi
18:57 <@heinrich5991> Savander: talking about the "Browser Election Request"s?
18:57 < Savander> i don't know..
18:58 < Savander> EastByte want "tcpdump -w shortdump.cap" 
18:58 < Savander> so i did it
18:58 < Savander> and i send it to east
18:58 < Savander> because i have really big lags on my servers
18:59 < Savander> 1 hour
19:00 <@heinrich5991> Savander: someone was spamming the server with udp packets at that time
19:03 < Savander> its 5 seconds log
19:04 < Savander> and i think, someone still spamming
19:04 < Savander> but, meh .. it can make big lags?
19:11 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: yep, I meant the browser election requests
19:11 <@EastByte> because they happened multiple times per second
19:11 <@EastByte> are you sure about the flooding?
19:11 <@EastByte> looks more like tw server requests from random people
19:12 <@EastByte> also not much traffic

19:20 <@EastByte> meh, my server is sending vote options but they don't appear in the client
19:21 <@EastByte> ahhh
19:22 <@EastByte> probably because vote clear is sent afterward
19:30 <@EastByte> grr, why did I use VoteOptionListAdd now
19:34 <@EastByte> deen: btw. there's is the problem: pUnpacker->GetString(CUnpacker::SANITIZE_CC|CUnpacker::SKIP_START_WHITESPACES);
19:34 <@EastByte> heinrich5991:
19:39 <@EastByte> okay it's tournament time
19:39 <@deen> EastByte: indeed!
19:40 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: yes, I'm sure that it's flooding
19:45 < Savander> meh.. still problems

20:17 <@heinrich5991> btw, is it impossible to play using two players or what?
20:17 <@deen> sure
20:17 <@deen> but 1 is frozen all the time
20:17 <@heinrich5991> how does the server check it?
20:17 <@deen> and dies at the end

20:59 <@EastByte> deen: any attacks?
20:59 <@EastByte> the hallowed faker wasn't able to take down the stream this time
21:00 <@deen> didn't see any attacks
21:03 <@EastByte> me neither
21:03 <@deen> was nice to stress test the servers though
21:03 <@EastByte> yea
21:04 <@deen> dummy is about the same serverload as normal player
21:04 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/612.png
21:04 <@EastByte> and eur seems to be good enough for tournament
21:05 <@deen> yes, was working well i think
21:07 <@EastByte> anqel was complaining about laggs on ger&eur
21:07 <@EastByte> a client problem maybe
21:08 <@deen> of the 10 fullest servers in TW 8 are ddnet =)
21:08 <@EastByte> :P
21:08 <@EastByte> KinG_ has problems to install sdl on ubuntu
21:08 <@EastByte> do you know the proper package?

21:10 <@heinrich5991> deen: what do you use to generate this and please warn for a >22000px high image next time :D
21:10 <@deen> you're trying to install sdl on a server?
21:10 < KinG_> nooo
21:10 <@deen> heinrich5991: haha
21:10 < KinG_> on my local pc ^_^
21:10 <@deen> heinrich5991: awesome screenshot, firefox extension
21:11 <@EastByte> btw
21:11 <@EastByte> https://eastbit.net/priv/hesse.webm
21:11 <@EastByte> what the hell is Hesse doing there
21:11 <@EastByte> looks botlike
21:11 <@deen> yes, that's an aimbot
21:12 <@deen> I've heard that a client based on ddnet client with aimbot was released 2 days ago
21:12 <@deen> guess that's it
21:12 <@EastByte> hm
21:12 <@EastByte> btw. you said you have a binary?
21:12 <@EastByte> which one is it?
21:13 < KinG_> EastByte: how can i play TW now? :(
21:13 <@EastByte> KinG_: try to install teeworlds using the ubuntu software manager
21:13 <@EastByte> it should install sdl aswell
21:13 <@EastByte> and then you can use the ddnet client
21:13 < KinG_> apt-get install teeworlds
21:13 < KinG_> will this work?!
21:13 <@EastByte> dunno
21:13 <@deen> should
21:13 <@EastByte> ubuntu has a gui for that
21:14 <@EastByte> ah okay
21:14 < KinG_> ubuntu@ubuntu:~/Downloads/DDNet-6.0.2-linux_x86_64$ sudo apt-get install teeworlds Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree        Reading state information... Done E: Unable to locate package teeworlds
21:14 < KinG_> linux is so confusing :|
21:14 <@EastByte> I don't like your ubuntu :P
21:14 < KinG_> me 2 :|
21:15 < KinG_> i should go for centos maybe
21:15 < KinG_> EastByte: can't you zip the files and give them to me?!
21:15 <@EastByte> try apt-get update
21:15 <@EastByte> amd apt-get upgrade
21:15 <@EastByte> KinG_: it's not that easy
21:16 <@EastByte> all packages depend on each other
21:16 <@EastByte> and they are different from distro to distro

21:17 < KinG_> i need TW :((
21:17 < KinG_> and apt-get install TeeWorlds don't work
21:17 <@EastByte> :/
21:18 <@EastByte> theree should be a program in ubuntu for installing software
21:18 <@EastByte> somewhere
21:18 < KinG_> yes
21:18 < KinG_> ubuntu software Center
21:18 <@EastByte> open it and search for teeworlds in there
21:18 < KinG_> but
21:18 < KinG_> have no install buttom for TW
21:18 <@EastByte> wut
21:18 < KinG_> only use this source
21:19 <@EastByte> deen: that's about teeworlds on ubuntu :P
21:19 <@EastByte> maybe we should make a static linked version of ddnet
21:19 < KinG_> how xan i take ss in linux?:|
21:19 <@EastByte> would be a ~15MB binary and some fixes
21:19 < KinG_> can*
21:19 < KinG_> where can i get it?!
21:20 <@EastByte> ss?
21:20 < KinG_> Screen Shot
21:20 <@EastByte> hm
21:20 <@EastByte> should be a tool there in ubuntu
21:20 < KinG_> what do u use?!
21:20 < KinG_> debian?!
21:20 <@EastByte> arch linux
21:20 <@EastByte> it's more complicated
21:21 < KinG_> my linux is flash bootable maybe that's the problem huh?!
21:21 <@EastByte> are you running it live from a device?
21:21 < KinG_> from my flash drive
21:21 <@EastByte> how did you put it on there?
21:22 < KinG_> but i chose to install it on flash drive it's not live
21:22 <@EastByte> okay
21:22 < KinG_> my linux is on my flash drive
21:22 < KinG_> 8GB free space for that
21:23 < KinG_> EastByte: is there anyway to fix this?!
21:23 <@EastByte> ubuntu should work on it's own :P
21:23 < KinG_> what do u mean?!
21:23 <@EastByte> deen: let's try to link ddnet staticly in favor of KinG_ :D
21:23 <@deen> EastByte: haven't heard of any problems with installing DDNet on linux
21:23 < KinG_> what does that mean? !
21:24 <@EastByte> that would fix the problem
21:24 < KinG_> lets do it!
21:24 <@EastByte> deen: well now you have
21:24 <@EastByte> KinG_: let's try something different
21:24 <@EastByte> adding some sources to apt
21:25 < KinG_> EastByte: maybe i should just repair my windows
21:25 <@EastByte> yea maybe
21:25 < KinG_> as i can see ubuntu is a bad linux :P
21:25 <@EastByte> well you should learn about linux itself
21:26 <@EastByte> using it for gaming doesn't work that well for beginners
21:26 < KinG_> i'm a gamer!
21:26 <@EastByte> ubuntu actually is an own os
21:26 <@EastByte> you should install a falt linux distro like arch in a virtual container
21:26 <@EastByte> and test around
21:26 <@EastByte> flat*
21:26 < KinG_> EastByte: lets fix my TW for now tommorrow i'll fix my windows
21:26 <@EastByte> and sry for your windows :P
21:27 < KinG_> ubuntu ruined my windows ^_^
21:27 <@EastByte> I did once too :D
21:27 < KinG_> actually i helped ubuntu to ruin my windows xD
21:27 <@EastByte> yea you did
21:28 <@EastByte> it's pretty hard
21:28 < KinG_> i pressed Restart Buttom when it was installing :P
21:28 < KinG_> button*
21:29 < KinG_> EastByte:  ok now how to fix TW ?!
21:29 <@EastByte> I'm searching
21:29 < KinG_> i'm confused
21:30 < KinG_> my linux boots from flash drive but works on my HDD
21:30 <@EastByte> what happens there "sudo apt-get install libsdl2"
21:30 < KinG_> my /home is my drive F:/
21:30 < KinG_> E: Unable to locate package libsdl2
21:31 <@EastByte> okay
21:31 < KinG_> and EastByte when i restart my pc all i have in downloads folder or browser cookies are gone u know why?!
21:32 <@EastByte> that's definitly a live distribution xd
21:32 <@EastByte> looks like ubuntu hasn't been installed
21:32 < KinG_> :|
21:32 < KinG_> without windows how can i make some free space for linux to install?!
21:33 <@EastByte> install windows and set partitions manually
21:33 <@EastByte> to keep space for linux
21:33 <@EastByte> after that you install linux in the free space
21:33 <@EastByte> and configure grub
21:33 < KinG_> wait there a min
21:33 < KinG_> u have skype?!
21:33 <@EastByte> why?
21:33 < KinG_> i want to boot again and install it
21:34 < KinG_> after that copy files to somewhere safe then install windows
21:34 <@EastByte> if the files do still exist, okay
21:35 <@deen> you should first install windows, then linux
21:35 <@deen> otherwise windows overwrites the bootloader and you can't start linux anymore
21:35 < KinG_> but then my drive C will be formated
21:35 < KinG_> i install linux on F and windows on C
21:35 <@EastByte> yea use ubuntu to safe files
21:35 <@EastByte> you can use the live distro for that
21:35 < KinG_> i don't have that
21:36 < KinG_> i mean the windows live
21:36 < KinG_> not linux
21:36 <@EastByte> what?
21:36 < KinG_> cause my ubuntu seems to be live now :|
21:36 <@EastByte> do you have any harddrives accessable in ubuntu?
21:36 < KinG_> the prob is that i can't see my Drive F
21:36 <@EastByte> if there aren't any it might be too late
21:36 < KinG_> i have all excpet Drive F
21:36 <@EastByte> was Windows on F?
21:36 < KinG_> no
21:36 < KinG_> C
21:37 < KinG_> i have access to C
21:37 < KinG_> EastByte: add my skype i will chat with u there
21:37 <@EastByte> why not on irc?
21:37 < KinG_> cause i'm going to try repairing my windows
21:37 < KinG_> so no IRC
21:38 < KinG_> w8 a min maybe i can access here with my phone
21:38 <@EastByte> deen: any fast way for me to get console access on his computer?
21:38 <@EastByte> hmm netcat
21:39 <@EastByte> nvm, wrong channel </topic>
21:42 < KinG_AndroiD> 123 test
21:42 < KinG_> 1
21:42 < KinG_> done :P
21:42 < KinG_> i'm going to try repairing my win
21:43 < KinG_> bye for now
21:57 < KinG_AndroiD> deen can u make a server file for android?
21:58 < KinG_AndroiD> i mean to run a server on phone 😁
21:58 <@deen> yes, you could do that
21:58 <@deen> i don't think it makes much sense
21:58 < KinG_AndroiD> that makes sens when u are alone no wifi or internet and u want to practice 😁
21:59 <@deen> then run the server on your computer
21:59 < KinG_AndroiD> when at school?
22:00 < KinG_AndroiD> alright why there is no repair bottun ?
22:01 <@EastByte> deen: it works so far: https://github.com/east/teeworlds/commit/630fd4fa073f339d70884e6976ba04b1cfa70b14
22:02 <@EastByte> but I'm not sure about removing votes
22:27 < laxa> !en-de fapping
22:27 < Nimda> Translation: fapping
22:29 <@heinrich5991> no
22:29 < KinG_AndroiD> laxa it says no root file system is defined when i'm trying to install ubuntu whqt does it mean?eastbyte
22:29 < laxa> I don't know
22:29 < laxa> I am busy :)
22:33 <@heinrich5991> KinG_AndroiD: you probably haven't set the root partition
22:35 < KinG_AndroiD> how should i set?
22:35 < KinG_AndroiD> http://www.uploadbaz.com/276aeg6resdg
22:35 < KinG_AndroiD> this ia the pic
22:35 < KinG_AndroiD> take a look at
22:35 < KinG_AndroiD> is*
22:35 <@heinrich5991> KinG_AndroiD: can you please use imgur? :(
22:35 < KinG_AndroiD> link?

22:37 < KinG_AndroiD> http://imgur.com/ojaGeHS
22:38 <@heinrich5991> KinG_AndroiD: where do you want to install linux on?
22:39 <@heinrich5991> on the flashdrive or on the hdd?
22:39 < KinG_AndroiD> hdd sda7
22:42 <@heinrich5991> KinG_AndroiD: click on change
22:42 <@heinrich5991> while selecting sda7
22:42 < KinG_AndroiD> then
22:42 < KinG_AndroiD> http://imgur.com/fCSV5zO
22:43 < KinG_AndroiD> it needs to format the partition but i don't want to
22:45 < KinG_AndroiD> what should i do?
22:46 <@heinrich5991> KinG_AndroiD: why don't you want to format the partition?
22:46 <@heinrich5991> and it should be "/" and not "/boot/"
22:54 < KinG_AndroiD> because all the games i have are in that partition and now i googled to see if that's possible but they say  NO 
22:55 < KinG_AndroiD> i think i have to extract all my files to another hard drive using windows live
22:56 < KinG_AndroiD> then format hdd
22:56 < KinG_AndroiD> after that re partition this to install ubuntu and windows at same time 😐
22:57 < KinG_AndroiD> and that should happen tommorrow i need to ask my friends for another hard drive 
22:57 < KinG_AndroiD> bye guys i go to sleep now
22:58 < KinG_AndroiD> ☺
