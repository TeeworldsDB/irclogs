07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Hey,
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> 
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> can someone tell me why the scores will not written in the database?
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> If someone finish, the server says:
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> https://i.imgur.com/Q99LrYK.png
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> The only thing what I did I added 2 colums to record_points 
07:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Is that a problem?
07:51 <@deen> do these columns have defaults?
07:52 <@deen> if not, then you have to modify the server source code to add values for them
07:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> The default is 0
07:52 <@deen> try the same sql query from a sql console
07:52 <@deen> what columns did you add btw?
07:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> My servers have all the same points so I just wan't to add a different between Gores & DDRace points.
07:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> https://i.imgur.com/8KwaLGW.png
07:54 <@deen> In these lines I don't see where the default is defined
07:56 <@deen> show create table record_points; should show MyColumnName INT DEFAULT 0 or something like that
07:57 <@deen> Btw, I'm wondering why you show up on IRC with a totally different name than on Discord.
07:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Can you see screens on IRC?
07:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> https://i.imgur.com/4PnFDn4.png
07:58 <@deen> Yeah, I just get a link and click on it
07:58 <@deen> yeah, that looks reasonable
07:58 <@deen> try the queries themselves in sql console
07:59 <@deen> INSERT INTO %s_point (Name, Points) VALUES ('%s', '%d') ON duplicate key UPDATE Name=VALUES(Name), Points=Points+VALUES(Points)
07:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Okay it was really the problem with default
07:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Mb, thanks ðŸ™‚
07:59 <@deen> You're welcome
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> How bad is it to see STUCK!!! in the logs? Is it just the good old magical edge or something serious?
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L792
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rude language btw: src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp:1750:                //TODO: make function for this fucking steps
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anxton> Hello, there's a 30 second delay before casting a vote when joining a server with anyone on it but when the other person leaves the delay still holds so it is faster to reconnect onto the server to call a vote
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> timout protection still not working?
