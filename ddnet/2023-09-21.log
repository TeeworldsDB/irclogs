07:49 < bridge> <Ewan> what's the best value second hand amd gpu rn
08:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> thursday vulkan
08:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks i heard shader/graphics modders complian about vulkan games harder to mod due to pipeline stuff (they are used to mod dx11) is that true?
08:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> 6600 xt or 6700 maybe
08:15 < bridge> <Ewan> thoughts
08:15 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://www.ebay.com/itm/394881563056>
08:15 < bridge> <Ewan> $125 usd
08:15 < bridge> <Ewan> + free ship
08:17 < bridge> <Ewan> considering buying a xeon e-2288g for the old motherboard. basically a 9900k but the xeon version
08:17 < bridge> <Ewan> so needs ecc and doesn't have igpu. fine by me
08:17 < bridge> <Ewan> found some for ~$180 on ebay as well
08:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> this reminds me since i finally go live alone i wanna setup my own home server
08:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill use gentoo or nixos probs and use distcc to help compile the server pkgs with my main pc
08:34 < bridge> <teero777> who's ready for minegrub?

08:51 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
08:51 < bridge> <Ewan> what i'd do is probably dualboot macOS & clear linux or some shit with opencore
08:51 < bridge> <Ewan> because i'm sick of needing macOS for singleton tasks and getting my 2009 imac out of the closet
08:51 < bridge> <Ewan> and waiting for its horrible hard drive
08:51 < bridge> <Ewan> and whatnot
09:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a work m1 so its not a problem for me
09:15 < bridge> <Ewan> nice
09:20 < bridge> <Ewan> trying to make a static build of qt 6.5 on msys
09:20 < bridge> <Ewan> this is no man's land
09:20 < bridge> <Ewan> wish me luck
09:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> gl
09:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> shouldnt u go sleep
09:30 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
09:30 < bridge> <Ewan> my sheets are in the dryer and it's been going for hours
09:30 < bridge> <Ewan> i told my mom i think the vent is plugged but she says it's just too wet and i shouldw ait
09:31 < bridge> <Ewan> as long as there's no fire i guess it's fine for now
09:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
09:31 < bridge> <Ewan> it's been like 4 hours now
09:31 < bridge> <Ewan> and it's just floppping around
09:31 < bridge> <Ewan> hot wet sheets and blanket
09:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> isnt it hot there
09:32 < bridge> <Ewan> where
09:32 < bridge> <Ewan> usa?
09:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> u live
09:32 < bridge> <Ewan> really depends
09:33 < bridge> <Ewan> it's hot during daytime because it's summer for the western hemisphere, but it's getting cold now
09:33 < bridge> <Ewan> especially at night
09:33 < bridge> <Ewan> entering fall
09:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> its funny cuz western is relative
09:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> asia could be western
09:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> from their poc
09:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> pov
09:33 < bridge> <Ewan> yea it's a rly stupid naming system
09:33 < bridge> <Ewan> but this is the western hemisphere
09:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> and who decided Australia is upside down
09:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> and not us
09:34 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah idk
09:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> If they don't use dynamic rendering, yes
09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> With renderpasses u are very aware of your dependencies
09:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> what triggers me is that they call vulkan bad cuz it makes their life harder
09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> This is good for more performance xd
09:35 < bridge> <Ewan> i'm hoping to use my fluent design Qt code + static linking and LTOs to make an app installer for Windows that looks native but is a fraction of the size of the XAML islands counterpart & doesn't require signing etc
09:35 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yeah, nobos xd
09:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> ffxiv
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> uses dx11
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but they wanna upgrade graphics
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if dx12 or vulkan
09:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> but apparently dx12 is low level like vulkan
09:36 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Vulkan introduced dynamic rendering specifically for when u just want to create game more easily.. more similar to opengl
09:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> and they crybabies
09:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Yes dx12 is similar
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> qt docs about static builds are really shitty in general so i don't know if i can use the current cmake integration to use my own libs or not
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> for now i'm just raw dogging it per se but im running into issues with macros n stuff
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks prepare tomorrow rust question
09:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> @reitw asked me interesting things in dm, maybe next time put it in this chabnel
09:42 < bridge> <reitw> yup
09:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> About rust?
09:49 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> You should also get a FFR activist like me

10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> nice readme guys
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> damn it doesn't embed
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> If this directory is empty, you probably forgot to compile the Qt library.
10:16 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
10:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://without.boats/blog/generic-trait-methods-and-new-auto-traits/
10:57 < bridge> <Ewan> i got it to compile with my bullshit cmake
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> 35MB exe with dumb linker and without LTOs
10:58 < bridge> <Ewan> not too shabby
10:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> lto should reduce size tm
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> yep
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> why r u on windows
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> but it is hard to set up with Qt
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> it works for me
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> so u left gentoo
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> u cant be in the club
10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> oh well
10:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> :BASEDHALT:
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> yea like a week ago exactly i thought man this install is driving me nuts
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> so i made a windows install medium and installed right over the gentoo. no backup
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> and ever since i've been living large
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> things have been working
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> 2 bad
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess u need more linux xp
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> so what if i do
11:00 < bridge> <Ewan> stuff is working
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont be angry i didnt mean it bad
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> o
11:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> why not try linux mint
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> i've used mint
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> and i used arch for 2 years ðŸ˜ƒ
11:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> i never used it
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> it wasn't the gentooisms that were driving me nuts
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> it was the linuxisms
11:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> arch is considerably more easy than gentoo
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
11:01 < bridge> <Ewan> it is
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> and now probs even easier
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> they made like a auto installer
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> with python smh
11:02 < bridge> <Ewan> oh cool
11:02 < bridge> <Ewan> is it official
11:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/archinstall
11:02 < bridge> <Ewan> seems neat

11:07 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> A gg
11:07 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> I need to setup wifi first :pepeW:
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao the riced out i3 setup
11:17 < bridge> <Ewan> been here as well
11:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> its hardly riced
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> mine was
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> and ive been use ng this since forever
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i used to "rice" it
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> but maintaining suckwd
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i embraced simplicity
11:20 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
11:35 < bridge> <cellegenrih> animated?
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> nah
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> it has to not be too distracting
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> so i can read terminal
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> and look at weeb pix
11:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> pic
11:57 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
12:04 < bridge> <Ewan> im close but i'm having bad errors
12:08 < bridge> <Ewan> the Windows platform plugin is having these undefined references
12:08 < bridge> <Ewan> BrotliDecoderDecompress (by proxy of freetype)
12:08 < bridge> <Ewan> WindowsCreateStringReference
12:08 < bridge> <Ewan> RoGetActivationFactory
12:08 < bridge> <Ewan> the first one i have no idea how to deal with since, as freetype is being linked against statically, it should then be linking brotli statically; but i have no static brotli on my system even with the pkg installed
12:09 < bridge> <Ewan> the latter two seem to be msvcrt functions which i obviously can't link against statically
12:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> too bad ur among linux enthusiasts
12:47 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> More like extremists ðŸ˜¬
12:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Gentoo can do
13:34 < bridge> <reitw> Already have it installed
13:34 < bridge> <reitw> At work :issou:
13:55 < bridge> <fokkonaut> o2
14:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> ðŸ˜¬
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks does wayland still force vsync
15:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> is it working nice with sdl2?
15:09 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> The new mesa will finally allow no vsync
16:32 < bridge> <0nathan47> hey i am looking for the offsets of the game because i want to do a deeplearning bot for myself. Can you help me to have it ? thanks
16:37 < bridge> <cyberFighter> no botting
16:55 < bridge> <nouaa> no botting
16:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> no botting
16:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> its funny to ask that for a open source game too

17:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks
17:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> #1 thing u will never need ðŸ˜¬
17:28 < bridge> <0nathan47> as i said its for a project for school
17:28 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> @ryozuki can i run startx automatically when i log in after starting pc? :justatest:
17:28 < bridge> <0nathan47> not for cheat + it will be only in local not on public servers
17:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> yed loo
17:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
17:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i sent u my xinitrc and bash profile
17:29 < bridge> <0nathan47> who
17:29 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Oh
17:29 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> :p
17:30 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> RL or ML ?
17:31 < bridge> <0nathan47> ML
17:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> sry I meant RL or UnSL or SL?
17:33 < bridge> <0nathan47> I only need the offsets of the game ( i didnt said but its for a friend cuz of its school project) idk what RL or UnSL or SL mean ðŸ˜…
17:34 < bridge> <0nathan47> he told me for the offsets
17:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Reinforcement learning, Unsupervised learning, Supervised learning
17:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw what do you mean offsets?
17:35 < bridge> <0nathan47> reinforcement learning
17:35 < bridge> <0nathan47> sec i will tell him to come here cuz im dumb
17:36 < bridge> <0nathan47> @dupeishere
17:36 < bridge> <0nathan47> he need to wait 10min for talk
17:37 < bridge> <0nathan47> @mr.gh0s7 can u dm him
17:37 < bridge> <0nathan47> its dupe
17:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ok
17:38 < bridge> <0nathan47> ty
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> what offsets
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> memory offsets?
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> bro
17:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> just compile the game
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> u have the source code
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> "hey give me offsets i wanna make a client side bot" in the dev channel that wants to fight against bots
17:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wonder if common sense exists
17:42 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah I don't know either xD
17:44 < bridge> <0nathan47> yes
17:44 < bridge> <0nathan47> yes thats it
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> well the answer is
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> find them urself
17:44 < bridge> <0nathan47> ..
17:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> have fun
17:44 < bridge> <0nathan47> my friend asked for them cuz its hard to find
17:44 < bridge> <0nathan47> so
17:45 < bridge> <0nathan47> if anyone found  them
17:45 < bridge> <0nathan47> maybe @fokkonaut or chillerdragon:
17:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> im telling you
17:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> where's chads here we compile it from source code :kek:
17:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> THE GAME IS OPEN SOURCE
17:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> we's chads here we compile it from source code :kek:
17:45 < bridge> <0nathan47> ik
17:45 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> we're chads here we compile it from source code :kek:
17:45 < bridge> <0nathan47> reading time :
17:46 < bridge> <0nathan47> my friend dont know how to find the offsets
17:46 < bridge> <0nathan47> thats why he is asking for it
17:46 < bridge> <nouaa> What if he/they are completely new to ddnet codebase, giving them a hint wont kill u right?
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> actually
17:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> they are asking stuff that is on a level where understanding ddnet code should be trivial
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> the fact they are asking means they probs dont know what they doing
17:48 < bridge> <0nathan47> we are asking to learn
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> well this is not a reverse engineering discord
17:48 < bridge> <0nathan47> tell us how to find the  we will do it by ourself
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> go find a tutorial
17:48 < bridge> <0nathan47> tell us how to find then we will do it by ourself
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> on how to find memory offsets
17:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> generally
17:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> then u apply that knowledge here
17:49 < bridge> <0nathan47> ..
17:49 < bridge> <dupeishere> If I ask it's because I don't know how to do it, I understood that it was open source but that's not my question
17:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill give u a hint
17:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur probs on windows
17:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> use cheat engine
17:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> find a tutorial
17:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> on how to find offsets with that program
17:49 < bridge> <dupeishere> I know you have to use it but if I ask I don't know how to do it
17:51 < bridge> <0nathan47> we will see for thats thank you
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> u find resources in the internet
17:51 < bridge> <dupeishere> I am a dev not a reverse engineer
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> same
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u want to do RE stuff
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> what u are or not doesnt matter
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> u go and learn
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> to my knowledge there are no RE experts here
17:51 < bridge> <0nathan47> teach us ig
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> im not an expert
17:51 < bridge> <0nathan47> thats not a problem if you know how to find them
17:51 < bridge> <dupeishere> me neither, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m asking you for help
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont know much either
17:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i already gave u pointers
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> cheat engine and find tutorials
17:52 < bridge> <0nathan47> maybe fokkonaut or chillerdragon will know ?
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i highly doubt
17:52 < bridge> <nouaa> Doubt
17:52 < bridge> <0nathan47> what does doubt mean
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> that i think they dont know either
17:52 < bridge> <0nathan47> ah
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> reverse engineering is quite niche knowledge
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i know
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> and ppl usually dont teach
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but i wont tell
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:52 < bridge> <0nathan47> why
17:52 < bridge> <0nathan47> bruh
17:52 < bridge> <nouaa> Lol
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the thing is
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> why u want offsets at all
17:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> just modify the source code
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> true
17:53 < bridge> <0nathan47> to do a deeplearning bot on ddnet for a school project
17:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xdd
17:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> a tip
17:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> he doesnt know what open source means
17:53 < bridge> <0nathan47> finish a gores map
17:53 < bridge> <0nathan47> by itself
17:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> its heavily system dependent so u have to figure it out, depending on windows or linux
17:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> find the program base address in code
17:54 < bridge> <0nathan47> he know xd
17:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> then
17:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> the variable u want
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> he probably uses a pre compiled bot client
17:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> and its a simple substraction
17:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is the easy way, using the source code
17:54 < bridge> <dupeishere> ðŸ’€
17:54 < bridge> <dupeishere> Nop
17:55 < bridge> <0nathan47> he will use ddnet client
17:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> thas all ill say
17:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont like ppl who want things handed in a silver plate
17:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> and botters
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then use the fcking source code lmao
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u know how fucking hard reverse engineering is?
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i did this for 1 year
17:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> also i dont like ppl asking for stuff thats higher level than their skill without a will to put effort in learning by research and asking the solution directly
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> ikr
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> i decompiled ffxiv
17:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what u usually do to start is try to understnand how strings inside the binary are used
17:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is a thing that can make it even harder
17:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think its some register allocation thing
17:57 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then u can guess first function names
17:57 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> zogitb: Memory offsets are changing runtime
17:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> automatic register allocation iirc
17:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> BTW I've done something similar but didn't got very far (because of no dgpu). I didn't use memory offsets just source code ;)

18:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> chinese
18:00 < bridge> <0nathan47> oh
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah
18:00 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i remember
18:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/MageDelfador/DDNet-show-points-in-game
18:01 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if gpu is the only problem, u dont have a problem xd
18:02 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I do they're expensive xD (I kinda rq cause the ai got stuck in places of a map plus I learned stuff about RL so mission passed respect++)
18:02 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd run it for u, when u done tweaking
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna try someday
18:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got a 3080
18:02 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> that's the problem I couldn't tweak it enough cause slow training
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragon: when 4090 VPS
18:04 < bridge> <0nathan47> give us upsets then we let you please
18:04 < bridge> <0nathan47> thats all i am asking
18:04 < bridge> <0nathan47> it dont kill u
18:04 < bridge> <0nathan47> please
18:05 < bridge> <0nathan47> @jupeyy_keks
18:05 < bridge> <dupeishere> This project use offsets to recover points
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 32bit or 64bit?
18:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> 0xBEEF
18:06 < bridge> <0nathan47> 64bit
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://ddnet.org/downloads/symbols/DDNet-17.3-rc1-win64-44d6a97f5075d52a8dbeb06a4566c3be720270b5-symbols.tar.xz
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> here are secret debug symbols. with debug symbols u can find your offsets. but please keep it secret
18:07 < bridge> <0nathan47> thanks
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://ddnet.org/downloads/symbols/DDNet-17.2.1-win64-c48d724889c6de248b11be5a0099bdee498f24ec-symbols.tar.xz
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> here for current release
18:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> top secret
18:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is just too funny
18:07 < bridge> <dupeishere> ðŸ˜‘
18:08 < bridge> <0nathan47> ..
18:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> its as easy as compiling with debug and running the client with gdb
18:09 < bridge> <0nathan47> i was happy to show to my friend a game i am playing since 4y but you seems not ready to help us. bye.
18:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> bye!
18:10 < bridge> <dupeishere> Well thank you for your help which was so useful to me. ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡
18:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> and remember, botting is not allowed in ddnet servers
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well that are seriously the debug symbols
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no scam
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> here even the source code
18:11 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Idk why but i have zsh on start so i added such thing to ~/.zlogin and everything works :DDD
18:17 < bridge> <0nathan47> as i said it will be used for a school project not cheat+ on  local server not on public.
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> school projects, brothers, my sister, the dog, and the cat
18:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
18:29 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar âœª for wat
18:31 < ChillerDragon> tldr i cba to read all the bs about offsets what is this about?
18:31 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> offline ddnet client when
18:32 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> How do u list to audio on gentoo? :o
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> AI training
18:34 < bridge> <headshotnoby> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1024593757062045749/1154321804605792296/218.jpg
18:37 < ChillerDragon> @Jupstar âœª
18:37 < ChillerDragon> > i did this for 1 year
18:37 < ChillerDragon> what did u RE?
18:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> what
18:41 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i do not want an ai powered dummy
18:42 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> chiller: ghosy did a AI
18:42 < ChillerDragon> for faster ai training?
18:42 < ChillerDragon> is it open source and tw related?
18:42 < ChillerDragon> i can run it on my machine then
18:43 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> listen* xd. I mean do u open .mp3 files sometimes?
18:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> zh
18:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
18:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> mpv
18:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Mpv
18:52 < bridge> <MilkeeyCat> Thanks :D
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> we run it on your machine aka VPS ðŸ˜¬
19:21 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i want my ddnet client on a golden plate
19:22 < bridge> <reitw> bruh I'm searching any ideas of Docker Containers apps that could be running on a Cisco switch,
19:35 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> what if its rust on linux served on a silver platter
19:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> tomorrow ill be a flat renter
19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> funny cuz i startef this game when i was 14
19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> and now im becoming independent
19:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
20:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @robyt3 why is that a bug?
20:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> isnt that the idea behind a snd buffer
20:40 < bridge> <robyt3> Hmm, maybe that's right, but why would we allow so large values then
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if u do sampling rate of 192000 it should make it faster again
20:41 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> at least that's how i imagine it
20:41 < bridge> <robyt3> I just noticed that I had a large buffer size and that's were the audio delay was coming from, seems like I accidentally set the buffer size
20:43 < bridge> <robyt3> I see, that works. We should probably document that better
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> or maybe the former should be set based on the other
20:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> and remove the config
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it also depends on the audio driver i guess
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno how exactly SDL decides to do it
20:51 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> we should at least check if it's good to just depent on each other
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> if in theory u have a very very slow audio device, it would maybe need a much bigger buffer. except windows etc. do extra buffering
20:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> on top of what we do
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> buffer size is an option because some computers can't fill smaller buffers fast enough
22:59 < bridge> <Ewan> leave the option and provide a reasonable default ðŸ˜ƒ
23:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Send link and setup commands
23:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> deal that out with ghosy xd
23:07 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> on my GPU the VRAM just fills to 100%. so i at least cannot use it in desktop mode xd
23:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @mr.gh0s7: goated
