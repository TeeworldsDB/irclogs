08:44 < bridge> <hectavoxel> I'm trying my luck on making an automapper handler in Scratch/TurboWarp. As an artist, my main goal is to have a sleek, easy to use and quick to learn way to visualize and edit automappers.
08:44 < bridge> <hectavoxel> It's going to be a long process, but I think becoming this passionate about automappers would really help people realize how much potential this has!

08:45 < bridge> <hectavoxel> Also doing this so that in the future it would help other programmers port a system like this into their own DDNet build!

11:43 < bridge> <learath2> Not like it'd ever be useful in an official server (unless you are a big abuse enjoyer)
11:45 < bridge> <meloƞ> i was mostly interested in `m_IsAll` rather than the feature itself, seemed like an easier way of handling this issue: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9278#issuecomment-2558089141
11:55 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, I don't even know what all would do in that case `tele all me` makes sense
11:55 < bridge> <learath2> `tele me all` not so much
11:55 < bridge> <learath2> `tele all all` huh?
11:56 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, I don't even know what all would do in that case.

14:22 < bridge> <Assa> side channel attacks are so nasty and hard to prevent
14:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> omw to spam the PR you did for me
14:29 < bridge> <meloƞ> good thing i just setup email filters <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
14:31 < bridge> <avolicious> Tzzz, WebKit (Safari's browsing engine). No more to say
14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @TsPiggy wdym by general use? 
14:31 < bridge> <avolicious> Safari is on the same level as Internet Explorer / Microsoft Edge is
14:31 < bridge> <alw5> hello
14:32 < bridge> <alw5> safari is so private
14:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> chillerdragon: idk, does it have a interface? is it designed for people to use as a client?
14:32 < bridge> <alw5> one of the best browsers for privacy
14:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> interface as in gui?
14:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> someone made a fork as a custom.client
14:32 < bridge> <avolicious> Safari is crap
14:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i thought it was a cmd bot
14:32 < bridge> <avolicious> Its like Edge
14:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what fork?
14:32 < bridge> <alw5> not for privacy
14:32 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but they are saying it is a client
14:33 < bridge> <TsPiggy> with gameplay features
14:33 < bridge> <avolicious> Firefox is pretty decent, but it annoys me that they introduce this crap like Mozilla VPN or whatsoever
14:33 < bridge> <TsPiggy> chillerdragon: some random chinese
14:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is it public?
14:33 < bridge> <TsPiggy> share a skin stealer in the chn group
14:34 < bridge> <TsPiggy> it uses chillerbot-ux.exe as the binary name
14:34 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i didnt download it and test
14:34 < bridge> <TsPiggy> but it seems like they shared it as a normal client with graphics
14:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @TsPiggy i use it as my daily driver and i do depend on those features for gaming but the main target audience is my self. So I do not mind having to edit text files for some features to work. But yes there are some casual non technical players in the user base of the 5 players who installed the client xd
14:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> oh so it is a client
14:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> nvm then
14:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i am happy when people use it but there is only so much energy i spend on making it a mainstream client
14:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i thought someone added graphic back
14:35 < bridge> <TsPiggy> bcs i thought you made that a automation bot
14:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i have to admit that when cactus client dropped with the exact same features and became super popular i got a bit upset :c 
14:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is chillerbot-ux and it can be compiled with a cmake flag to get term-ux which is a linux only curses client
14:36 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i guess i never knew what chillerbot actually is. i always thought it was a cmd bot for automations
14:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> chillerbot-ux is super close to ddnet so they can also just compile it like ddnet with -DHEADLESS_CLIENT=ON and drop the graphics
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> well "chillerbot" by it self is nothing
14:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> no i mean i thought if was like auto chat bot and auto rcon and stuff.
14:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> cuz, you know. it is called a bot
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is chillerbot-ux which is my ddnet fork whith a few additons which also includes term-ux 
14:37 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :nouis: :nouis:
14:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the name "bot" is because i am edgy
14:38 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ye then it is np then
14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> there is a few chillerbot clients such as chillerbot-ng that do not have any graphics
14:38 < bridge> <TsPiggy> then i guess all i need to tell you is that chinese guy forked your client closesourcedly
14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sus
14:38 < bridge> <TsPiggy> almost all chinese forks are close sourced
14:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> any chillerbot that has a "z" in its name is an illegal cheat client
14:39 < bridge> <TsPiggy> they dont like sharing
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> such as chillerbot-zz and chillerbot-zx
14:39 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i dont think that matters nor you should state them here
14:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh yea rule 7
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just wanted to be transparent because you asked about "bot"
14:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> just making sure the ux one is somewhat safe so i dont need to do anything as a chn community manager
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the z series is not publicly distributed
14:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> i get that
14:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ux tries to be fully compliant
14:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> let stop talk about bots lol
14:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> already got my answers, thx coldbird
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it has chat automation, skin stealer and spike tracers as its most sus features
14:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> oh then i think it is straight up your client
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://chillerbot.github.io/img/features/spike_tracer.png
14:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> not even a fork then
14:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> imagine playing silex maps without spike tracer
14:56 < bridge> <zeta133> Can you help me
14:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> you should #✉-create-a-ticket if you have anything that needs a moderator
14:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> if you already did, then you should wait.
14:57 < bridge> <Assa> I just read `spice tracer` and thought like you watched too much Dune sh
15:22 < bridge> <zhn> ChillerDragon: can you please pull up wireshark and send me valid succeed rcon auth and failed one?

15:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why does she even want the FE?
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> why not
15:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its non existent

15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> let's face it, as long as amd cannot compete, it's good for nvidia to keep the stock low.
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they can release a new gen and increase the price exactly by the performance increase xdd
15:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the 4090 did not loose any value at all, so 5090 can be super expensive
15:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> boo
15:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanted my 4090 xd
15:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well soon the non-FE come out
15:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> wen
15:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I dunno, you the news guy 😬
16:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Sometimes
16:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so much work why dont u do it ur self @zhn 
17:09 < bridge> <zhn> i thought u had samples
17:09 < bridge> <zhn> anyway i figured it out anyway
17:09 < bridge> <zhn> thanks
17:09 < bridge> <zhn> anyway anyway xd
17:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got generics in my work lang
17:12 < bridge> <meloƞ> 😳
17:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki>     pub fn hello_generics<T>(x: T) -> T {
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki>         return x;
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki>     }
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki>     pub fn main() -> i32 {
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki>         let value: i32 = hello_generics::<i32>(4);
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki>         return value;
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki>     }
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> it needs u to specify it at call site cuz no inference yet tho
17:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> but dope
17:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> man at some point i got a bit stressed as if i couldnt do it
17:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i got it done
17:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
17:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jsaurusrex did u test it ingame?
17:17 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> yeah
17:18 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> hopefully i caught everything this time
17:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont use antiping so i didnt notice xd
17:23 < bridge> <kebscs> @jsaurusrex btw you can type "fixes #number" or "closes #number" so itll auto close the issue when merged
17:24 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> in the description / first comment?
17:24 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> or the title
17:25 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> wait nvm i see it
17:25 < bridge> <kebscs> pr description
17:25 < bridge> <jsaurusrex> aight will do ( '-')vb
17:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Sry to inform you I already did it after ryo pressed merge
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> gm
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> nice job
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> how are u gonna handle type inference?
19:36 < bridge> <Ewan> i think this was talked about already but idk whose lang xD
20:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I have a private repo with pcaps. They include sensitive passwords and my MAC address and so on. And not every case such as wrong password is covered. iirc should be the same as correct password just a different string in the rcon line message
20:10 < bridge> <Ewan> chiller hru
20:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> g&u?
20:18 < bridge> <Ewan> alright
20:18 < bridge> <Ewan> breathing and such
20:18 < bridge> <chillerdragon> mood
20:30 < bridge> <chairn> yeah, it's called not running after performance. Speculative execution, branch prediction, caches, etc. are all opening vast possibilities for side channel attacks
20:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean the fixes destroy all performance gains
20:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so smth that is fast and still safe
20:37 < bridge> <chairn> not possible because fast means executing things that might be wrong (speculative execution, branch prediction, load predictor, etc.)
20:38 < bridge> <chairn> even without those, pipeline stalls will also leak data
20:38 < bridge> <chairn> and caches as well, so either you remove all those and have huge performance loss, or you have leaks
20:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> some day
21:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> does your lang have global variables?
21:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> the grammar is there but i forgot if they work
21:36 < bridge> <Ewan> xd

22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> Haven't been motivated/not enough time to potentially break everything related to input handling and windowing yet
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> SDL3 has some useful features though, so we should eventually upgrade
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-3.2.0
22:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> go and implement 😬
22:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok tomorrow
22:27 < bridge> <zhn> wasn't there some feature-stopper that brake something for macos?
22:27 < bridge> <zhn> broke*
22:30 < bridge> <robyt3> Nobody tried upgrading to SDL3 AFAIK
22:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok ill do it
22:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> deploy friday
22:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> deploy sdl3
22:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i can only assure the quality of linux builds i take no responsabilituy for windows users

22:49 < bridge> <Ewan> microsoft foundation classes reference
22:49 < bridge> <Ewan> if you know you know
22:53 < bridge> <chairn> i don't get why they need backward compat for 25+ years old compilers 😄
22:54 < bridge> <Ewan> msvc 6 is the last supported compiler version for win98
22:54 < bridge> <Ewan> well
22:54 < bridge> <Ewan> 9x
22:55 < bridge> <Ewan> not including mingw
22:55 < bridge> <Ewan> back compat for a project like SDL especially is almost a requirement
22:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> the check if a system has `longlong` is what scares me more
22:55 < bridge> <meloƞ> i think you would need to use something pre c99 for that
22:56 < bridge> <meloƞ> which, again - is 25+ years old <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
22:56 < bridge> <Ewan> well the c standard is not the same as the compiler version
22:56 < bridge> <Ewan> i know people that love c99 and use it every day
22:56 < bridge> <Ewan> vc6 is when you need to post on twitter that your thing still works on windows 9x, btw
22:56 < bridge> <Ewan> or

22:57 < bridge> <Ewan> vc6 is for when you need to post on twitter that your thing still works on windows 9x, btw

23:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe its a bit early, gentoo doesnt have sdl3 yet
23:28 < bridge> <Ewan> lol rip

23:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> We should use the new fancy sdl3 callbacks instead of the sdl main. Apparently it’s more portable for stuff like iOS and so on.
