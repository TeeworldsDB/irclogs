04:16 < Elbide> i wish i could just start hitting people with my empty weapon
04:16 < Elbide> it would be humorous
04:45 <@deen> haha
14:05 < Savander> deen: what's wrong with map HDP_Zinderenco?
14:05 < Savander> best time: 0.00.02 
14:05 < Savander> hmm?
14:10 <@deen> sounds like a cheat
14:10 <@deen> probably you can skip the start line?
14:11 < Savander> don't know
14:11 < Savander> but 200+ times
14:11 < Savander> have simillar record
14:12 < Savander> i don't see possibility 
14:12 < Savander> to finish this map in 0.00.02 sec.
14:12 < Savander> start line at bottom
14:12 < Savander> and finish line at top
14:12 < Savander> it's huge map
14:13 <@deen> very weird
15:11 < Savander> what cpu throttling does?
15:12 < Savander> i got less fps but my mouse sometimes accelerates.
15:13 < Savander> throttling Throttling decrease CPU usage?
15:18 <@EastByte> it does small sleeps in mainloop
15:18 <@EastByte> e.g. waiting a microsecond before continuing
15:18 <@EastByte> decreases cpu usage yes
15:23 < Savander> so those small sleeps, can accelerate my mouse?
15:23 <@EastByte> no idea why that happens
15:24 <@EastByte> didn't notice that
15:24 < Savander> it's happens on old and new computer
15:25 < Savander> when you move cursor, it looks normal, but sometimes ( very often), cursor just accelerates.
15:25 < Savander> No idea why :p.
15:34 <@deen> i always use cpu throttle 1
15:34 <@deen> so i have 10% cpu and not 100% in TW
15:36 < Savander> i have 3000 fps
15:36 < Savander> cpu throttle 1 reduce it to 1000+
15:36 < Savander> on trhottle 2 i have 500
15:37 <@deen> you should also enable vsync
15:37 < Savander> 1000+ it's too much
15:37 < Savander> vsync make my mouse "Swimming"
15:37 <@deen> no idea why people like to burn their GPU with thousands of FPS in a 2d game
15:37 < Savander> no accurate.
15:38 < Savander> that's why i don't use vsync
15:38 <@deen> disable triple buffering
15:38 < Savander> what is it?
15:40 < Savander> it's in GPU settings?
15:40 <@deen> increases delay
15:40 < Savander> or inside tw/
15:40 <@deen> yeah, i saw it in nvidia gpu settings
15:40 < Savander> hmm, radeon
15:40 < Savander> i'll look for it
15:43 <@deen> I've seen even funnier things on Windows btw
15:43 <@deen> When you enable vsync the GPU goes into power saving mode
15:44 <@deen> and suddenly your fps drop down to 30
15:44 < Savander> o.O
15:44 <@deen> really great^^
15:44 < Savander> I never experienced it.
15:44 < Savander> WOW.
15:44 <@deen> ?
15:44 < Savander> i have disabled 
15:44 < Savander> this tripple buffering
15:44 <@deen> and, better?
15:44 < Savander> (was disabled)
15:45 < Savander> not really, i feel big latency
15:45 < Savander> between move mouse nad cursor
15:45 < Savander> and*
15:45 <@EastByte> I have the same problem with vsync
15:46 <@EastByte> input is delayed
15:46 < Savander> yup
15:48 < Savander> http://mystrd.at/articles/v-sync-mouse-lag-how-to-fix-it/
15:49 <@EastByte> "Simply by using V-sync AND limiting FPS exactly 1 frame below the screen refresh (eg. 59 FPS for a 60Hz screen). This means that there wonâ€™t be anything for the V-sync to buffer ahead, your controls will retain instant response and no VGA power will be wasted."
15:49 <@deen> sounds weird
15:53 <@EastByte> I have been using teeworlds with vsync diabled and throttle 1 since ever
15:54 <@EastByte> 400 fps average, 20% cpu and graphicscard is at about 38 degrees
15:55 < Savander> card squeaks when i have too much fps :P
15:56 < Savander> + high temperature
15:56 <@EastByte> I know the sound aswell^^
15:56 <@EastByte> > 1000 fps
15:56 < Savander> yea
15:56 < Savander> :D
15:56 < Savander> ;)
15:57 < Savander> very often in teeworlds i have more than 1000 fps.. and it's problematic, but with throttling my mouse accelerates
15:57 < Savander> so it's problem too
15:58 < Savander> FPS limitter in teeworlds?!!? <woah> i guess, hard to implement
15:58 <@EastByte> nah, it's not hard
15:58 < Savander> sorry (for me it's hard, im shit in programming)
15:58 < Savander> i don't even how it works.
15:58 < Savander> :PP
15:59 <@EastByte> just sleep between every frame so that you have x frames per second
15:59 <@EastByte> for 60 fps it should be 16ms per frame
16:00 <@EastByte> and you have to substract the rendering time
16:00 < Savander> aah
16:00 < Savander> 1000/60 ?
16:00 <@EastByte> yea
16:00 <@EastByte> should be a bit more accurate though
16:01 < Savander> but rendering time is dependent by hardware?
16:01 <@EastByte> yep
16:01 <@EastByte> you need to comopute the needed time before
16:01 < Savander> so how you want to get this time :P
16:01 <@EastByte> compute*
16:01 <@EastByte> timestamp now - timestamp before rendering
16:04 < Savander> ahm, before to compute likely outcome?
16:05 <@EastByte> huh?
16:06 < Savander> and you have to substract the rendering time =>  imestamp now - timestamp before rendering => ahm, before to compute likely outcome?
16:07 < Savander> OH funny bug
16:07 < Savander> if you have a grenade in hand
16:07 < Savander> then you take ninja
16:07 < Savander> and touch armor
16:07 <@EastByte> /1000/60 - (time now - time before)
16:07 < Savander> you have still grenade in hand
16:08 < Savander> and you can cheep
16:08 <@EastByte> cheep?
16:09 < Savander> like a tee inside freeze
16:09 < Savander> when you want fire
16:09 < Savander> want to shoot
16:11 <@EastByte> in ddrace?
16:12 < Savander> yes
16:16 < Savander> come
16:16 < Savander> to me for a second
16:16 < Savander> :P
16:22 <@EastByte> deen: can you join us?
16:32 < Savander> :PP.
16:32 <@EastByte> :D.
16:33 <@EastByte> last writing final exam tomorrow, math :)
16:34 < Savander> in poland it's called "matury"
16:34 < Savander> :p
16:34 <@EastByte> ah
16:35 < Savander> polish, english, math
16:35 < Savander> biology, geography
16:35 < Savander> germany
16:35 < Savander> german*
16:43 < o_be_one> hi :)
17:09 <@deen> Savander: then why you never speak german?!
17:10 < Savander> i can't
17:10 <@deen> but you have an exam in German?
17:10 < Savander> optional
17:10 <@deen> ok
17:10 < Savander> english or german
17:10 < Savander> :p.
17:10 < Savander> deen: http://www.savander.pl/img/0XMtYFFJ8419
17:11 < Savander> can you tell me
17:11 <@deen> heh
17:11 < Savander> why i can't run server xD?
17:11 <@deen> sorry^^
17:11 < Savander> probably because of fifo, butt..
17:11 <@deen> yeah yeah, give me 1 min
17:12 < Savander> ok
17:14 <@deen> Should work now:
17:14 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/vJhyt
17:14 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 5988162 def: Fix running without fifo console
17:16 < Savander> yup
17:16 < Savander> works
17:21 < Savander> hmm
17:50 < Savander> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/game/server/entities/pickup.cpp#L101-L104
17:50 < Savander> it can be in one line?
17:51 <@deen> i don't understand
17:51 < Savander> it is the same condition
17:51 <@deen> yeah, you could
17:51 <@deen> but it's easier to understand as it is, maybe
17:52 < Savander> both are easy to understand :P
17:52 < Savander> just a question
17:52 < Savander> ;p
20:27 < Nimda> Between the Mountains by S.O.S. just released on Brutal at 2015-05-07 20:24
21:01 < Savander> No sounds while hooking or jumping on dummy, it's bug or the desired effect?
21:01 <@deen> bug
