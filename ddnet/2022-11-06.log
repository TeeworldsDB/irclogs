00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :justatest:
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well not caring is an option
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but if u like making ur editor rly ur own in a way it makes coding more enjoyable then even better
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but if u like making ur editor rly ur own in a way it makes coding more enjoyable (for you) then even better
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> chiller switching to neovim from vim is just a drop in
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its  compatible
00:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i actually alias vim to nvim
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ur vim config will work on neovim
00:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> print the code and send it to elon musk
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> 1k for one LGTM
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1588772122125815808
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> interesting read
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> SRE = stack ranked engineer
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never read that buzz word
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i think it means engineers that know the ins and outs
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the whole stack
00:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sre? site reliability engineer
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ahh
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well he lates says stack ranked engineers
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iguess its not related to sre
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe i did missread
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a image he quotes, idk from who
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1038593108167905501/image.png
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ohh
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i get it now
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as in elon ranked engineers with line of codes
00:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> english suxs
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mr.Gh0s7> nice let's add //---------- THIS IS THE START OF THE COMMENT ------ // style 100 code block just to not get fired
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure if that's actually confirmed tbh
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> its like the two guys in front of the twitter building
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> that trolled the media
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> and said they were fired <a:OMEGADANCE:906802381445029919>
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he definitly fired ppl
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1588671155766194176
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> well if you worked at twitter
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> you can get a job literally everywhere
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would u buy a company that loses 4m/day
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> to make it better?
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> and its a meme
00:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> win/win
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> surely he will make it better :Clueless:
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Elon's companies are losing money as well
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> :Clueless:
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Getting sponsored by us government
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the best is that ppl think he is a genius
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but itsj ust that when u have lot of money, it comes to you easily even if u fail a lot of times
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in fact, u can fail a lot of times
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), this isn't necessarily true. Data from the BLS shows that approximately 20% of new businesses fail during the first two years of being open, 45% during the first five years, and 65% during the first 10 years.
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the phrase before the quote is
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > It's often said that more than half of new businesses fail during the first year.
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i copied it wrong xd
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nevetherless they fail
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a billionare just can afford failing a lot
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> he built a space company that's now more efficient than the NASA and a car company that completely revolutionized cars itself
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont buy too much in the marketing
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the rocket is amazing, but NASA made the whole foundations of what he is making
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> credit where is due
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the cars..
00:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk bro xd
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is certainly a twitter genius
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> driving the masses
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wont deny that
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i cringe so much reading the replies
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> there was not one single car brand with full-driving capabilities
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> and still NASA didnt came up with the idea of letting the rockets land instead of wasting Millions in tax payers money
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_self-driving_cars
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> bruh
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> yea totally
00:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why do u sound like the average twitter guy
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> why do u sound like the average twitter guy?
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill tell you
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stuff like the james webb is way more amazing than a rocket that can land again
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and more  sophisticated
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> real science, they aim higher
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because they always parrot this stuff about nasa and tax payer money
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> compare it to the army spenditure
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its like a ant
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they should instead get way more
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its way more useful to society
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> we are not talking about the army, we are talking about spacex compared to nasa
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh god
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok im out
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> bringing up shit like the army, especially in the US is brainless
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> before i say smth too out and heinrich bans me
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my inner urge is killing me XD
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> can't handle a discussion?
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can, but i know its meaningless
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im a practical man, this is worthless
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you win
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> enjoy it
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> yea you have your entitled opinion that NASA is the best and SpaceX is the worst or well Elon Musk is the worst
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> and he is just a twitter person that handles the mass or plays with it
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `NASA is the best and SpaceX is the worst or well Elon Musk is the worst` well at least dont put words in my mouth
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> he did more in his 5 years as a business man than all of the car companies combined couldn't do
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:cirSnap:700638300959932516>
00:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> SpaceX's goal to build roxkets and bring people to space, NASA is government research agency, they do different stuff
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> you didn't specifically say that, but it seems like you are feeling that way with your arguments
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats ur interpretation
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in fact i did say their rockets are amazing
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its a valid for them to research reusable rockets, but NASA doesnt have that as a priority, they mainly launch one-off satelites
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> but then again downplayed it with "nasa built the foundation". Of course they built the foundation, they were first with all of it, after the russian i guess <a:OMEGADANCE:906802381445029919>
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> but then again downplayed it with "nasa built the foundation". Of course they built the foundation, they were first with all of it, after the russians i guess <a:OMEGADANCE:906802381445029919>
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> NASA dont build roxkets tho, they buy and use roxkets from other 'launch providers'
00:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its ok if i **would** downplay it anyway
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> NASA dont build rockets tho, they buy and use roxkets from other 'launch providers'
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i was just giving credit where due
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> NASA dont build rockets tho, they buy and use rockets from other 'launch providers'
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the amount of effort from nasa is way higher
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they did build rockets
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but now t hey buy launchers from e.g spacex cuz its cheaper
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but truly battle tested rockets like the a saturn V
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which brought the man to the moon
00:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Saturn V[a] is a retired American super heavy-lift launch vehicle developed by NASA under the Apollo program for human exploration of the Moon. The rocket was human-rated, with three stages, and powered with liquid fuel. It was flown from 1967 to 1973. It was used for nine crewed flights to the Moon, and to launch Skylab, the first American space station.
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> I wanna see SpaceX 50 years from now.
00:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Well in fact SpaceX exists to service NASA contracts :troll:
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think spacex gets the contract assigned cuz they tick the most marks
00:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but public agencies offering contracts cant choose one in a biased way
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1038599310767570984/image.png
00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> spacex is not even top 10 on the contractors
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most costly stuff is not the rocket itself
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well idk but probs
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
00:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Complicated stuff, but anyway the do a bif different stuff, hard to compare them
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Complicated stuff, but anyway the do a bit different stuff, hard to compare them
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what im the most excited about is

00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmC-FwibsZg
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I wonder when ddnet will launch moon servers
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> And who will be first player
00:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :troll:
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to plug a rly awesome video now that talk about this
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDrBIKOR01c
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and sleep time
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> > NASA's budget for fiscal year (FY) 2021 is $23.3 billion. 
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> > In 2021, the United States spent around 800.67 billion U.S. dollars on its military. 
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Funny how people interested in killing each other more than exploring universe
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> 10 seconds in and this already feels like some evil promo thing
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gotta promo for the normies
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :LOL: it's not a competition yo
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> elon musk didnt "make" all that stuff, the scientists and engineers did lol
03:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> youre an elon fanboy?
03:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> "fanboy" just shows me what kinda person you are. <a:OMEGADANCE:906802381445029919>
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> so yes
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> I like the companies he put in the world
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> his memes on twitter are great
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> does that make me a fanboy?
03:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes
03:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Meekrioz> well im a fanboy then :YEP:
03:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Using twitter makes you a horrible person already
05:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> does this affect physics tho

10:06 <+ChillerDragon> ``1100 0000 0000 000`` should be -64?
10:07 <+ChillerDragon> a missed a 0
10:07 <+ChillerDragon> ``1100 0000 0000 0000`` is what i meant
10:08 <+ChillerDragon> so first 1 says extend second 1 says negative and since there is no -0 .. ah wait
10:08 <+ChillerDragon> double byte 0 makes no sense wot
10:10 <+ChillerDragon> okay wait but this should be -1 right? ``0100 0000``
10:11 <+ChillerDragon> not extended, negative, zero = -0 doesnt exist so -1?! xd

11:46 <+ChillerDragon> says "decentralized" advertises m$ github as the main server :D
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> but yea I guess would work on any git instance
11:46 <+ChillerDragon> I became big github sceptic yesterday when they banned poor @Swarfey :(
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Why would they
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> ban him?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Yes
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> they wont tell
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> its pretty fcked up
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Discord-Bridge haters
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> imagine losing all your repos you dont have cloned locally atm
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> If somone forked them that can help
11:48 <+ChillerDragon> yes
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 🧐
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> Already sent a request asking for the reason but i have also seen threads where they simply wouldn't answer
11:48 <+ChillerDragon> not all my 174 repos are forked tho xd
11:48 <+ChillerDragon> and thats only on my main acc
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I saw you have like 20 orga with repos
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I saw you have like 20 orgs with repos
11:49 <+ChillerDragon> ye
11:49 <+ChillerDragon> github is my life
11:49 <+ChillerDragon> but apparently github does random bans
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Pretty weird solution to whatever problem you faced
11:49 <+ChillerDragon> so time to move to ryos gogs instance
11:49 <+ChillerDragon> why weird solution and why problem?
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Do you use gitlab? I saw you added .gitlab folder to ddnet repo 💀
11:50 <+ChillerDragon> imo orgs are nice for organisation and brands etc
11:50 <+ChillerDragon> yes i have like 1 repo on gitlab
11:50 <+ChillerDragon> my bot client fork of chillerbot-ux to use my own gitlab runner for the pipeline to get unlimited private repo CI minutes
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I mean why would you create so many orga for repos you can create in your account
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I mean why would you create so many orgs for repos you can create in your account
11:51 <+ChillerDragon> because those things are brands :D
11:51 <+ChillerDragon> im big influencer
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I see...
11:51 <+ChillerDragon> and it allows me to bundle repos that belong together
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Makes sense
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Kinda
11:51 <+ChillerDragon> omg
11:51 <+ChillerDragon> it makes perfect sense
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> look at dis all ddnet++ related repos https://github.com/DDNetPP/
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> i can name it DDNetPP/maps instead of ChillerDragon/DDNetPP-maps also i want to remove my self and embrace community participation
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> not that i have any success with it but the idea counts
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> Or all my stick figure battle games in one spot with a nice picture https://github.com/chichilku/
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Yeah it makes sense in this case, but all the orgs have so many related repos?
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> nah
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> i gotta admit something
11:53 <+ChillerDragon> those were good examples
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> but you said i do weird stuff to solve some problems
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> and i actually do that too and i admit its weird
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDune
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> here i created a org just to be able to fork teeworlds again because back in the days you could only fork one repo once per account. So i wanted to keep my teeworlds fork but also wanted to fork dunes fork of teeworlds
11:54 <+ChillerDragon> but i stopped doing that :D
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> You still cant make more than 1 fork :justatest:
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> Then I have 3 orgs just for teeworlds demo files. But I got a lot of demos xd. Also me trying to escape github limits without paying.
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ChillerDragon2 just to clone tee again 💀

11:58 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:59 <+ChillerDragon> holy shit im procrastinating hard bcs too lazy to understand packers
12:00 <+ChillerDragon> yo @Swarfey ur packers work dont ey?
12:01 <+ChillerDragon> or what was the C# guy name again
12:01 <+ChillerDragon> @Matodor sos
12:01 <+ChillerDragon> holy shit im annoying xd
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> Everything in my client should work now
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> Packer & unpacker do certainly
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> ok so how to pack multi byte negative numbers?
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> go send -65 as binary
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> :monkaS: cant tell you from the top of my head
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> On phone atm
12:03 <+ChillerDragon> nob
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> You can Check my implementation at https://npmjs.com/packages/teeworlds
12:03 <+ChillerDragon> F
12:03 <+ChillerDragon> github
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> Or check heinrich's docs
12:03 <+ChillerDragon> lmao 404
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> You can Check my implementation at https://npmjs.com/package/teeworlds
12:04 <+ChillerDragon> im sure heinrich reported you on github for chosing bad npm package name and now u banned
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> Ah its /package/ not /packages/
12:04 <+ChillerDragon> axaxaxax
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> xaxaxaxxa
12:04 <+ChillerDragon> deserved.
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> 100%
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> but honestly trol
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> to name repo tw-chatonly and pck teeworlds
12:05 <+ChillerDragon> why not name package like repo?
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> Cuz it wasnt a chatonly client at that Point anymore
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> wowo
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> Its a lib for creating teeworlds bot
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> hax
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tEAworld sports, its in the game
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> xd
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> You can make it move and Check where it is through snapshots
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> wot
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> Even though that's a bit more complicated to do atm
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> wat u talkin bout m8
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> The library
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> a
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> snap > chat
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> i see
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> Im curious if i get that far
12:07 <+ChillerDragon> might do a rebrand then as well
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> and name my package tEAworld cuz jopstar is my life advisor
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> What is urs named?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> Wasnt it ruby-tw or something
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> atm my repo is named teeworlds-client and i didnt publish a lib yet because im not quite sure what it should do and how to name it
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> xd
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> a
12:09 <+ChillerDragon> also gotta create a org first just to trol anime pdf
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> what?)
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> Ok I just verified by sending a packed integer over da network using tw code and dissector by da one and only heinrich
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> -65 is sent as 0xC0 0x01 aka ``1100 0000  0000 0001``
12:22 <+ChillerDragon> so i did understand it correctly just my test code is wrong!?
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> maybe endianness fucked me?
12:23 <+ChillerDragon> fml
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Git gud
12:25 <+ChillerDragon> fakof .-.
12:25 <+ChillerDragon> wait did you say git is good because the twitter thing or did you tell me to get good?
12:26 <+ChillerDragon> HEINRICH SOS HE BULLY ME
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> I did not understand why in the network part only UUID messages use bytes_be_to_int, but the rest of the code does not
12:27 <+ChillerDragon> nice
12:27 <+ChillerDragon> i didnt even get to UUID messages yet
12:28 <+ChillerDragon> ``Packer.Data()`` is sent over the network as is rite? No shinanigans?
12:28 <+ChillerDragon> unless compressed ofc
12:36 <+ChillerDragon> holy shit i think i got it
12:47 <+ChillerDragon> ok i got all. Scratch all my questions. I only got answers at this point.
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gawahig> https://t.me/+PEc8FSRwFiFiYzc0
13:14 <+ChillerDragon> gota build a filter for t.me
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmm. the network part should just stuff the raw bytes of the UUID into the packet
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you mean the snapshot?
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> +
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1038799536463827044/unknown.png
13:59 <+ChillerDragon> yo heinrich wdym by check the size?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> `CPacker::Size()` I guess
14:00 <+ChillerDragon> ah ye that makes sense 
14:00 <+ChillerDragon> thanks robster
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the thing is that a UUID is bytes, and the snapshot needs integers
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need a function like `bytes_be_to_int` or similar to convert it
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> But why is BigEndian being used? is not used in other parts of the code
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seemed natural to me
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you would have used little-endian instead?
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 almost gotcha
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1038802624117493780/image.png
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> I don't know, I didn't get into that subject. Does the network send a set of bytes taking into account the order of bytes on the sending machine?
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> speedrun
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1038802831148331069/image.png
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> at least in the game protocol at the level of sending data I have not seen this
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> If so, why convert the UUID to an array of big endian byte order?
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the network's sending code should not (and does not) rely on the host byte order
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> but how does the client part recognize the byte order?
14:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> basically, to convert bytes to an integer, you need to decide whether you want to do it as a big-endian or a litle-endian integer
14:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> byte order of what? the network protocol has no real byte order. it uses the variable int encoding that ChillerDragon just explored
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> I mean, if the server is big endian and the receiving side is little endian, how does the process work in this case?
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the server encodes its integers using the variable int encoding
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. 1 is converted to the byte 0x01 on the network
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or 65 is converted to the bytes 0x81 0x01 (if I got it correctly)
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this does not vary with the byte order of the host
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> no no no, I don't mean compressed int, I mean lower level  = net_udp_send->sendto
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `net_udp_send` takes bytes and sends bytes
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it gets the bytes `0x00 0x20 0x40 0x12`, it'll send exactly these bytes over the network
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in this order
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> дак вот, если сервер имеет big endian, а принимающая сторона - little endian, как в этом случае работает процесс?
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1038804532395773983
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> So, if the server has a big endian and the receiving side has a little endian, how does the process work in this case?
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> big and little endian don't have any influence on byte array
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> big and little endian don't have any influence on byte arrays
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the correct answer to the question is: it has no influence at all. but it seems there's a misunderstanding that led to asking that question
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if a big endian computer has a byte array with the bytes 0x12 0x23 0x34 0x45 0x67, it looks like 0x12 0x23 0x34 0x45 0x67 in memory
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if a little endian computer has a byte array with the bytes 0x12 0x23 0x34 0x45 0x67, it looks like 0x12 0x23 0x34 0x45 0x67 in memory
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no difference at all
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the difference is in their native representation of an integer, but that doesn't really matter, you should simply not inspect it
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but for completeness:
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on a litte-endian computer, the number 513 is represented as 0x01 0x02 0x00 0x00
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on a litte-endian computer, the 32-bit number 513 is represented as 0x01 0x02 0x00 0x00
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on a big-endian computer, the 32-bit number 513 is represented as 0x00 0x00 0x02 0x01
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but it doesn't have influence on byte arrays. only on native representation of integers
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: the size check needs to be an `ASSERT_EQ` not an `EXPECT_EQ`
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so that it aborts the test if it doesn't match
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> do you mean machine word?
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise you'll continue to the contents check which might read out of bounds
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> or integers
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not only machine words, machine integers I guess
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Deeper> @Matodor when mlife?
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for example your computer stores 64-bit, 32-bit, 16-bit integers as little-endian
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 8-bit integers can't have a byte order, they only consist of a single byte
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> okay @heinrich5991 thx, I think I've figured it out now.) ❤️
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> What happens if the server sends a 5 or more byte packed integer? Does the client crash?
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> lmao i love it never seen that ``} while(false);`` thats a cool goto replacement
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ?
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that looks like a simple scope
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> ? my first or second msg=
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 2nd
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 1st = why should it
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> because c++ ints are max 4 bytes
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> 2nd https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds/blob/6b7fa9308e59ac8110f2aa58a03bdd50995c0266/src/engine/shared/compression.cpp#L57
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> here while(false) is used to allow breaking to the end
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah thats what u mean 😄
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> ill add this to my toolbox i would have used goto in that case
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can also do it with a lambda
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> or with ``system()``
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> xd
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or with std::thread
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or with std::abort
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or with rust
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> or with for loops? xd
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with unsafe rust
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can also call that code on your GPU
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust has safe goto-like jumps
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> within the same function
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> using block labels
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> blocker f3
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/loop/nested.html
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```rust

16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>             // This would break only the inner loop
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>             //break;
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>             // This breaks the outer loop
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>             break 'outer;

16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     }
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki>     println!("Exited the outer loop");
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> }```
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lol
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> this breaks the outer loop
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> aaaaaaaaaaa we can click links -.-
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so it will still continue the inner
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> spamma
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah xd

16:55 <+ChillerDragon> addewd UwU
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i really like it even if u dont use it very often probs
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> rust? 
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> yeah
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> i dont use that very often xd
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use it more often
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> trollerdragon
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pun intended
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kekw
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> use basic, then u have to use goto
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> BATCH masterrace
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> program bash in basic
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> learn to write
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> languages are bloat
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> i packer working pog
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> write the hex instructions directly
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> cringe hex
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> binary op
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> u just slow typer
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> i only need to keys on my keyboard
16:57 <+ChillerDragon> heck i can write code with my mouse
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> make a programming language that changes byte-endianess & bit-endianess after every new variable
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with 2 hex u can represent 1 byte
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why its poggers
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> with 8 bits you can only use 2 characters thats why its poggers
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> 16 chars is bloat
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> change my mind
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wat
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:06 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/48d82e9bfdb503d5c3d7059f59049b6b72d649b0/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L522
17:06 <+ChillerDragon> whats the 1 being sent with rcon auth?
17:07 <+ChillerDragon> And whats the magic w username anyways? How compatible is it with vanilla?
17:07 <+ChillerDragon> Is sending a empty name skipped by vanilla anyways because ``Unpacker.GetString(CUnpacker::SANITIZE_CC)`` eats the leading nullbyte?
17:28 <+ChillerDragon> Meh no i seem to get a wrong password if i do that :(
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> xd fr
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> char on 8 bits is bloated af
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> tru short masterrace
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> wait wat
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> uh
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> there is nothing smaller than char huh?
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> that indeed is bloat
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> y
17:41 <+ChillerDragon> what about bools?
17:41 <+ChillerDragon> idk what a bool is tbh
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> bool are encoded on 8 bits too
17:41 <+ChillerDragon> BLOAT
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> y bloat af
17:41 <+ChillerDragon> i guess thats why bit flags are a thing
17:41 <+ChillerDragon> cuz bloat datatypes
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> y
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> ryo go buil unbloated programming lang w 1 bit bools
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> recently ive made an emulator for a 12 bits langage
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> conclusion: 12 bits is bloated too
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> only 1 bits bool is legit
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> Im not sure if its nice that my method allows different data types as parameter xd
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> it can do ``rcon_auth('', '123')`` as in username, password
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> x) it depends
17:45 <+ChillerDragon> and ``rcon_auth(password: '123')`` which is only one hash with the optional key :name and the required key :password xd
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> its rust ?
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> nah ruby
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> owo
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> i never used ruby
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> its not typed so im lost
17:46 <+ChillerDragon> doesnt matter
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> read it like python
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> and hash as dictonary i guess
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> its probably really bad
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> whatever
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> does ruby support method overloading ?
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> idk
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> why tho?
17:48 <+ChillerDragon> i technically have it implemented im just not sure if its bad or rly bad to do it
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> if there are no types overloading is a bit pointless it only boils down to amount of parameters 
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> one could also use default parameters them
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> i probably read some books on how to design good code and shit
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> should^
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> wont^
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> so unless someone stops me now and here ill go with it
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> I think that in itself it is not very serious but being able to call the function with different arguments takes away from the clarity of the code
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> yes clarity gone
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> ye fuck i should pick whatever is better xd
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> x)
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> its so weird vanilla calls ``RconAuth("", pass);`` everytime xd
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> i kinda did not want to ship that as n api
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> what, what uppercase at the beginning ? they dont apply cameCase ?
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> what, why uppercase at the beginning ? they dont apply cameCase ?
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> no teeworlds uses UpperCamel case for all methods!?
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> since always
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> oh
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> its cringe no ?
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> no
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> ``CClient::RconAuth(const char *pName, const char *pPassword)``
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> i mean, i feel like you are calling a class constructor
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> watafak
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> do u even code tw?
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> no
17:52 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> ))
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> never doubt holy tw coding style
17:53 <+ChillerDragon> all hail magnus
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> in c++ im used to apply uppercase only for interface or class name
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> did u ever use veracrypt ?
17:54 <+ChillerDragon> i feel like every code base has a different c++ style
17:54 <+ChillerDragon> nah
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> cuz i wanted to use something else than LUKS based programs
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> but i feel like there are not so many alternative on linux
17:55 <+ChillerDragon> then its time to roll your own crypto as heinrich would say
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> xd
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> lawyer jopstar? I can make up quotes without ending in jail ye?
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> "roll your own crypto whenever possible" - heinrich5991
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> x), ill report it
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> faaak
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> 🙂
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its fine i control justice
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> pog
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> btw, youre talking throught IRC right ?
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> yes
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> the only acceptable chat protocol together with tw chat
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> matrix is hipster
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but irc ist hipsterer
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> do you use proxy or something ?
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> matrix is for soydevs
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Modern PC memory modules transfer 64 bits (8 bytes) at a time, in a burst of eight transfers, so one command triggers a read or write of a full cache line from memory. (DDR1/2/3/4 SDRAM burst transfer size is configurable up to 64B; CPUs will select the burst transfer size to match their cache line size, but 64B is common)
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> i run a irc client on my vps
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> as bouncer
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> oh interesting
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> cuz discord is bloat
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> cuz discord is tos
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> y
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> i want to use irc too but i dont want to reveal my ip adress
17:59 <+ChillerDragon> why not
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @b0th hello :troll:
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> :Pepega:
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:pepegaHammer:687785994627317854>
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> hola
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> ip is not that confidental usually
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> y ik
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont own ur ip
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the isp does
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> bloat
18:00 <+ChillerDragon> bloat xd
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> i also rent my flat
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> and yet my address is confidental
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> ownership is not a requirement for confidentallity
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> yep
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> but leaking ip is usually not too bad anyways
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> bro im using shred on my usb key, its taking yeaaaars to overwrite
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> u wanna use some kind of bouncer anyways to have logs when u go afk
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> what a bouncer rly does actually ?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> its a kind of bridge ?
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> idk
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> i never bothered to look into it
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> because running the irc client 24/7 on my vps and accessing it via ssh worked fine for me
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> and you stopped doing this ?
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> no
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> i still do
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> isnt it dirty xd ?
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> how?
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> doesnt feel like
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> i couldn't tell a difference wether im in via ssh or not
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> it looks long to setup a bouncer
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> i guess ill just use my real ip
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> idc
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> leak
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> x)
18:08 <+ChillerDragon> if you are keen to use a microsoft bouncer i can recommend you using my minecraft chat <-> irc bridge xd
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> x)
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> what irc client are you using ?
18:08 <+ChillerDragon> weechat
18:08 <+ChillerDragon> poggers
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> oh i remember this onbe
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> ive used it in the past
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> lemme download it
18:08 <+ChillerDragon> virus
18:09 <+ChillerDragon> dont download china messanger
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> xd fr ?
18:09 <+ChillerDragon> weechat = poggers ncurses chat app
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> idc my bios is infected 🤓
18:09 <+ChillerDragon> wechat = china spyware
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> ah
18:10 <+ChillerDragon> i think the chinese term for spyware is software
18:10 <+ChillerDragon> axaxax
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> xd
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> oh i have irsii
18:12 <+ChillerDragon> lit
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> oh i have irssi
18:15 < Nagi01> i guess im in
18:16 <+ChillerDragon> henlo o/
18:18 <+Nagi01> it looks so unbloated there :pepega:
18:18  * Nagi01 
18:19 < chillerstar> hi ChillerDragon
18:19 <+ChillerDragon> wot
18:19 <+Nagi01> uh
18:32 <+Nagi01> ok i created a quakenet acc
18:33 <+Nagi01> i feel better now
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> accounts are bloat
18:36 <+Nagi01> y its sad
18:53 <+ChillerDragon> is there docu somewhere on how CClient::m_PredictedTime works? wat it do  on a high level?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it predicted time
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the answer to "is there docs on x code" on tw is 99% of the time "no"
18:56 <+ChillerDragon> yes but how is it calculated
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it doesnt compute it, it predicts it :troll:
18:57 <+ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki thought so too but i latley realized how much useful stuff i missed in libtw2/docs
18:57 <+ChillerDragon> i kinda knew it was there but forgot and found out another way
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Development
20:03 <+ChillerDragon> omg poggers it alive! Totally worth the effort xd https://zillyhuhn.com/OpenTube/videos/users/chiller/ruby_gamer_jumping.mp4
20:08 <+Nagi01> oh nice
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> whats with the 0; m
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> whats with the 0; ?
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> where wot? which 0;
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn 0.7 is ugly
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thanks for reminding me
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Um actually its pretty nice \🤓
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Can totally agree 🤓
21:54 < Anime_pdf_> +1
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wtf
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its happening
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1038936731057131640/image.png
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i hope ppl using gentoo read the deps line
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz a casual rust here will take them quite a bit xd
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or use dev-lang/rust-bin
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also i wonder if the binary from oficial rust is faster
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz they use PGO and BOLT
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/facebookincubator/BOLT
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/bolt
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah well its here now
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > BOLT is a post-link optimizer developed to speed up large applications. It achieves the improvements by optimizing application's code layout based on execution profile gathered by sampling profiler, such as Linux perf tool. An overview of the ideas implemented in BOLT along with a discussion of its potential and current results is available in CGO'19 paper.
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Switched to rust-bin
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Seems like rust's fault if their compiler is so complex that it takes that long to compile 😄
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its not that rust takes long
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or the language is that slow to compile in general
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but rust pulls in llvm
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, I thought it uses standard llvm
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you mean people who don't have llvm installed yet?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> uh i think it does
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I always had llvm and gcc installed on gentoo anyway, compared to libreoffice they didn't take that long to build, just a few hours here and there
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 😄
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> haha
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess im biased cuz i recently installed gentoo and had to get llvm
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> rust doesn't use standard llvm, they use a specific version and they have their own patches
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh then that
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually makes sense
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz even if llvm claims to be general its rly focused on c++
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and rust uses other stuff thats not throrougly tested
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> such as noalias
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can get rust to skip a step by making it use the already installed rust to bootstrap, that makes it faster, but still bootstrapping a whole compiler takes a while, no matter the language really
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do we put the bin or not in the readme for gentoo
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Pascal language family would like to have a word
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what has pascal?
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly, I'd leave it `dev-lang/rust` and hope people using gentoo aren't installing things blindly. They should be used to binpkgs and normal packages
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pascal, now that is one language I haven't heard of in almost half a decade 😄
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Last I had to deal with pascal was reverse engineering an ancient photoshop add-on
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Super fast compile times: https://prog21.dadgum.com/47.html
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is the compile time actually at parsing or optimizing?
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess pascal just leaves it mostly as is?
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > By the mid-1990s, Borland was citing build times of hundreds of thousands of lines of source per minute.
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Yes, there was a drawback to instantaneous compile times. Fewer optimizations were done, and almost always the resultant code was slower than the C equivalent. But it didn't matter. Removing the gap between the steps of writing and running code was worth more than some amount of additional runtime performance. I used to hit the build key every so often, even while typing, just to check for syntax errors. And zero compilation speed eventua
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> faster than assembler even, haha 😄
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> faster than assembler is actually surprising
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess cuz the custom linker
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they mention
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Minimal linker. Have you ever looked at the specs for an object file format? "Complicated" and "bulky" are two terms that come to mind. Turbo Pascal used a custom object file with a minimal design. The "linker" wasn't doing anywhere near the work of standard linkers. The result was that the link step was invisible; you didn't even notice it.
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess that also moves some complexity to the runtime
