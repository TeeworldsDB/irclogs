17:59 < Shorefire> deen: You about?
18:02 <@deen> hi
18:02 <@deen> sometimes
18:05 < Shorefire> Does noone else ever come here?
18:12 <@deen> Sometimes
18:12 <@deen> and leave after telling me their issue
18:14 < Shorefire> heh
18:14 <@deen> probably less often now with the forum
18:14 < Shorefire> It's in my autojoin's now so I will be here most of the time 
18:15 < Shorefire> Could probably bring more users if you have a little bit of text at the bottom of the forum saying "come chat" with a link to a web-irc client
18:15 < Shorefire> (Like most forums tend to)
18:16 <@deen> Trueture
18:16 <@deen> good idea
18:35 < Shorefire> Could you enable the use of avatar's from external urls?
18:35 <@deen> not planning to, why?
18:35 < Shorefire> That way I can upload my avatar to imgur.com and use it as it's more than 6kb
18:35 <@deen> hm
18:35 <@deen> does it have to be that big?
18:36 < Shorefire> I'll try making it smaller
18:39 < Shorefire> How small is yours?
18:39 < Shorefire> Mine is 80x80 and still 9kb ;_;
18:40 <@deen> 5 KB
18:41 <@deen> well, i could just increase the limit a bit
18:41 <@deen> 15 KB fine?
18:41 < Shorefire> yeah
18:41 < Shorefire> Brilliant, thanks
18:41 <@deen> done
