01:27 <@deen> I added 2 new stats for player-hours per day: http://ddnet.tw/stats/
01:28 <@deen> can see the weekends and summer holidays easily. disregarding the block server we're having a slight increase of player numbers with the steam release
01:38 <@deen> Also fun: 7000 hours played yesterday, 848 hours of ranks made, so 88% of playing went into no finishes
04:13 < eeeee> nice. assuming that's how much people play every day, ddnet wasted over 600 human-years :D
10:46 <@heinrich5991> "wasted"
10:50 <@EastByte> not particularly wasted :p
10:50 <@EastByte> rather spend for a good cause

20:33 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
20:33 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 480
20:33 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
20:33 <@deen> GER2 getting ddosed
20:33 <@EastByte> GER aswell
20:34 <@EastByte> whoops GER2
20:38 <@EastByte> we should take it down
20:39 <@deen> EastByte: you know that 30% of players have ping 100 for half the day on GER?
20:39 <@EastByte> right, but like you said, the traffic is expensive
20:39 <@deen> only outgoing traffic
20:39 <@deen> and I'm still waiting for the new GER server =/
20:39 <@EastByte> ah
20:39 <@deen> incoming is free
20:40 <@deen> but sure, if someone can offer another server in the area, we should replace GER2 immediately
20:52 < laxa> I can offer good VPS as I said
20:53 < laxa> same hoster as ddnet Website
20:55 <@deen> I wouldn't host DDNet servers with harmony-hosting
20:55 < laxa> Why not ?
20:56 <@deen> their servers go down randomly and have other problems and when I ask them what's wrong they mostly don't know
20:56 < laxa> You can't have your "perfect host" simply cause it's impossible for the money we can spend
20:56 <@deen> but every other hoster I've tried was more reliable
20:56 < laxa> nothing is perfect
20:56 <@deen> and their ddos protection was the worst, I asked them to disable it and keep it disabled
20:58 <@deen> i couldn't accept when DDNet game servers just randomly go down 4 times a day for hours
21:00 < laxa> That was bad luck I guess
21:00 < laxa> not sure they still have those kind of problems
21:02 <@deen> bad luck 50 times?^^
21:03 <@deen> last huge problem that they didn't notice on their own was just a few weeks ago
