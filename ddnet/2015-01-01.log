12:48 <@EastByte> good morning
12:49 <@EastByte> deen: nice blog post
12:49 < BeaR> happy new year \o/
12:49 <@deen> EastByte: ew, i didn't want to make it public yet^^
12:49 <@deen> but Araq is still asleep it seems
12:49 <@EastByte> oh I'm sorry :p
12:49 < KinG_> hi guys
12:49 <@deen> happy new year BeaR and rest
12:49 <@EastByte> happy new year \o/
12:49 <@deen> EastByte: anything I could change?
12:50 < KinG_> hey deen  EastByte  happy new year guys :)
12:50 <@deen> hi KinG_ 
12:50 <@deen> It's not new-year in Iran, is it?
12:51 < KinG_> no not
12:51 <@EastByte> I like your post in its current state
12:51 < KinG_> but for me and my friends it is
12:51 <@EastByte> but some things are complitcated for me
12:52 < BeaR> hm does nim also use llvm?
12:52 <@deen> EastByte: hm yeah, i'm not really explaining much, but the intention is just to get you interested
12:53 <@deen> BeaR: not directly, but you can compile using clang (which compiles faster and makes nim binaries faster usually)
12:54 < BeaR> k, so it generates C code?
12:54 <@deen> yes
12:54 <@deen> or javascript
12:55 < BeaR> hm should have read the frontpage ._.
12:56 <@deen> or my new post!: http://hookrace.net/blog/what-is-special-about-nim/
13:01 < KinG_> bb :)
13:02 <@deen> Sounds like we're getting a Persian server again
13:02 <@deen> KinG and his clan bought a dedicated machine with 16 GB RAM
13:02 <@EastByte> \o/
13:02 < BeaR> hm looks like an interesting language :d
13:03 <@deen> BeaR: and 1.0 will be released soon!
13:03 <@deen> not sure if i should write something about that in the post
13:10 < BeaR> yeah, there should be a note
13:10 < BeaR> for which kind of applications would you use nim ?
13:11 < Muttley> Happy new year all
13:11 <@deen> happy new year to you too, Muttley 
13:12 <@deen> BeaR: you can even use it for High Performance Computing
13:12 < BeaR> so some sort of replacement for c++?
13:12 <@deen> but generally I would use it for everything that doesn't need 100% performance, but is ok with 99%
13:13 < Muttley> Savander, did you manage to fix the dkim shizzle ?
13:13 < BeaR> ^^
13:13 < Savander> Muttley: email works
13:13 < Savander> DKMI too
13:13 < Savander> :)
13:13 < Muttley> cool, what was it ?
13:13 < Savander> i will show you
13:13 < Muttley> what was wrong
13:13 < Savander> wait
13:14 < Savander> http://pastebin.com/uDs2a4Z1
13:14 < Savander> this
13:14 < Savander> SigningTable
13:14 < Savander> was wrong
13:14 < Muttley> damn that litle :P
13:15 < Muttley> but good that its fixed
13:15 < Savander> ye; )
13:15 < Savander> i changed
13:15 < Savander> rDNS too
13:15 < Muttley> good no dynamic anymore ?

13:17 < Savander> 10/10 :DD
13:17 < Muttley> nice that is what is required ;-) 
13:45 <@deen> EastByte, BeaR any opinion on the "template log" example in the blog post?
13:45 <@deen> (araq wants me to remove it because it's boring)
13:47 < BeaR> tbh I didn't really understand this part
13:47 <@deen> ok, even worse^^
13:48 <@deen> I'll make another example

15:16 < BeaR> "We can write the exact same code and have it run at runtime and compile time. No template metaprogramming necessary." - But all the fun \o/
15:17 < seymour> nice :D
15:17  * seymour upvotes
15:17 <@deen> Learath2: yeah, and nice emails by random people. didn't expect this for my after-midnight blog post
15:18 <@deen> BeaR: if you like template metaprogramming, write Haskell instead :P
15:18 < BeaR> haskell too easy :>
15:18 <@deen> Write Nim macros!
15:22 < Question> hi i have a question i will be happy if help me guys, why when i add new tune in tuning.h under for example this ***MACRO_TUNING_PARAM(GrenadeLifetime, grenade_lifetime, 2.0f)***
15:22 < Question> laser be fat
15:22 < Question> ?
15:23 < BeaR> what do mean with 'laser be fat' ?
15:26 < Question> see this

15:26 < Question> its normal
15:26 < Question> but my laser will be fat ( i mean wide )
15:28 < Question> now see this http://i61.tinypic.com/25z410k.jpg
15:28 < Question> its fat
15:29 <@deen> I've often wondered about this, good question
15:29 <@deen> I mean, I've often seen fat laser on other servers
15:29 <@deen> if you want to add a tuning you have to add it at the bottom
15:29 < Question> i know deen
15:30 < Question> but i want to know why it happend ?
15:30 <@deen> I don't know, find out!
15:30 < Question> hi deen :P

15:31 < Question> BeaR: ?
15:31 < Nimda> DDNet Brazil went back online!
15:31 < BeaR> dunno, looking at the code
15:33 < Question> as deen say i dont know why it happend i just want why it happend 
15:33 < Learath2> BeaR: do you have anything else you see that i should fix in autoupdate ? do have some 4 hours free time :P
15:34 < BeaR> Learath2: the build errors I told you yesterday
15:37 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
15:38 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
15:40 <@deen> Learath2: test it on linux if you can!
15:40 <@deen> make sure it works on 32/64 bit
15:41 <@deen> autoupdater is a part that really shouldn't break

18:29 <@deen> hi guys
18:30 < bor> hi
18:32 < bor> deen , do you have any experience buying a server's hardware yourself ?
18:32 < bor> rather than renting one from a datacenter 
18:33 <@deen> only the hardware I have running at home :P
18:35 < KinG_> deen: you don't know anyone that can help us in this? we searched everywhere for it but nothing :(
18:35 <@deen> Not really, sorry
18:35 <@deen> dedicated servers always were too expensive for me
18:35 < KinG_> ok thanks
18:38 < KinG_> bye guys igtg
