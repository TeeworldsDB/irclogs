00:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder how such a big outage could ever happen
00:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> was the intern making the change
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> windows updates
00:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd
00:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if it was one guy they are getting their ass kicked for the millions they cost mr zucc
00:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i guess its not even that bad for them, its been through all news, good free marketing

00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you know what? at that scale cosmic rays would be the only explanation I'd forgive the intern for
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> new game
00:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd blame the person that didnt buy ecc RAM
00:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> ran out of debugging time at the end. might be horribly broken.  :justatest:
00:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> the power bricks just fall off the screen wtf
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just attach another power connector xd
00:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> you have to line it up exactly
00:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> You guys made it so vali can't ddos teeworlds and 1st thing he does is ddos facebook i hope ur happy ðŸ˜¤ ðŸ˜¤ ðŸ˜¤
00:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hope, unlike us facebook would have his ass for the millions he cost them ðŸ˜›
00:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> also you can recatch the falling bricks. it falls pretty slow for you to catch tbh.
00:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> sad news facebook is back online :(

09:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> you seem to be just as funny as bjÃ¶rn when you ask such questions haha, he is not even noticed without this ddos shit because no one is interested in him. through the ddos notices at all someone that he exists, hope he continues to do it at great sites and moves for it where he belongs
09:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> you seem to be just as funny as bjÃ¶rn when you ask such questions haha, he is not even noticed without this ddos shit because no one is interested in him. through the ddos notices at all someone that he exists, hope he continues to do it at big sites and moves for it where he belongs

10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Whos vali
10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Tell him about kog
10:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> :troll:
10:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <CÃ¸ke> i think he is not interested in such small servers
10:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> hey guys I have this weird problem -- the moment i press the Editor button on the main menu my desktop computer starts making a weird high pitched noise, the moment I exit the editor it instantly stops (I don't know which part is making the noise lmao I've never heard smth like this before) -- it doesn't happen in other uses of my computer, or in other parts of the ddnet client(nvm as I was typing/testing this I realized a similar noise hap
10:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> lmao this sounds so stupid
10:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> also it's not the cpu fan spinning too fast, it's barely spinning
10:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> lmao it only happens in the editor when the UI elements are present (if I press tab to toggle them noise goes away)
10:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> coil whine
10:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this might be interesting for #developer
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't understand it. might be related to rendering text?
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> can depend on exact power consumption of your gpu
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> how come it's so instant, what happens the moment I press editor that makes it start
10:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> you can try f1, gfx_refresh_rate and change to another value there, try 0, 480, 120
10:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Because your GPU instantly switches to a specific power mode I guess
10:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and rendering all the text might be more/less taxing than the normal menu and ingame
10:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> it was set to 0, I set it to 480 and it went away
10:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> I also now noticed it happens (to a lesser degree(less noisy), and not at all instant) when in game, a lot harder to notice
10:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> should editor have capped fps by default?
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have this in the entire game and I get different pitches depending on the state of the ui
10:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think itâ€™s bad isolation on the sound output :/
10:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> sry i don't get it, what does sound output have to do with this (is there sound in editor)?
10:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, you get noise outside?
10:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I get it on my speakers and headphone
10:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> yep, not from the speaker, from the computer itself
10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sounds like coil whine alright. I donâ€™t really know a way to fix it
10:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> capping gfx_refresh_rate (i capped it to 480) like deen said solved it
10:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Great \o/
10:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Bonus point: You now have lower power consumption
10:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> :poggers: time to offset that with mining bitcoin
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> feature request: make gfx_refresh_rate 0 placebo, use gpu power that'd be used for 1k fps+ go towards mining ddnet crypto, ez sustainable business model :trollet:
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> You found the one way of making money that's even worse than advertisements, so no thanks ðŸ˜„
10:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/ cloudflares blog posts are so nice to read. They have some people that write so good
10:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Because their blog targets potential employees, not potential customers
10:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw apparently the root issue was an invalid configuration value in persistent storage, causing the configuration validator to keep going off when it finds an invalid cached config value. Feedback loop ðŸ˜›
10:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> which caused their bgp sessions to go  down ðŸ™‚
10:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> which caused their bgp sessions to go down ðŸ™‚
10:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And took down the database that was hosting the config ðŸ˜„
10:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> An interesting failure though, Iâ€™m sure their blog post was simplified but it sounds like bad engineering practice to do a database query when you find an invalid config value. Shouldnâ€™t you be pushing these changes rather than polling them?
10:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh and the amount of data dns hosters get is insane, I never quite considered how much they can track
10:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah the config thing I read was a previous post-mortem, nvm. So itâ€™s still unknown what actually happened. Someone nuked the routing table? ðŸ˜›
11:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Fortunately, 1.1.1.1 was built to be Free, Private, Fast (as the independent DNS monitor DNSPerf can attest), and scalable, and we were able to keep servicing our users with minimal impact.

11:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> my covid vaccine has coil whine help
11:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> [marked as duplicate]
11:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wanted to get one of those biohax chips in my hand actually, but I don't think I can put it there myself without lidocaine
14:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just buy some fancy 8k GPU for 5000 dollars, it will be so underloaded by teeworlds that it won't consume alot of power
14:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Cipy29)
14:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for me the diff between 1k fps and 500fps ingame is under 10 watts
14:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and my card has a TDP of like 300 Watts
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but fps caps for different context sound good, editor & menu vs ingame & demos
14:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Maybe we should add it
14:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the question is always, what is a good default value xD
14:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
14:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> vsync would probably the best for such stuff
14:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
14:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> But we also know the display's refresh rate now
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> hey @Learath2
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> any idea where in the source code it does the serverinfo request?
14:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> `CServer::SendServerInfo`Â is what sends it, but `UpdateServerInfo` -> `CacheServerInfo` is what generates it. It's only generated when something about the server changes
14:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Trying to cache the packet using a hardcoded request
14:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> but it doesn't seem to respond at all
14:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, if you show me the request I can take a look at it, but caching at the firewall for too long doesn't sound like a great idea to me
14:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The new central serverlist is already fairly stale (5s) If it gets cached for longer on the firewall it'll lead to extended periods of stale serverinfo
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> 30s
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> this is just for older clients anyway
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> anyway, I just hardcoded
14:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> `\x78\x65\x5b\x06\x00\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\x67\x69\x65\x33\xdb`
14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the central serverlist also uses the serverinfo request for now, until @heinrich5991 finishes up the server part
14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> seems the first 4 bytes are random
14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> and the last byte too
14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> thats whitelisted
14:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> so that won't be cached
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> tbh, I could probably make the current protection less "aggressive"
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> which means it would allow all traffic, until an attack starts
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> players who are already connected will stay connected
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> but until the ddos attack is going on, only newer clients can join
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> but while the ddos attack is going on, only newer clients can join
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> `src/engine/shared/network.h`Â documents the packet header, it shouldn't be random
14:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> its a random "token"
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> sha1 apparently
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The last byte is a token in that packet
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> well
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> from 3 samples
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> the packet looks like this
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 2 bytes of extra token, 1 byte of basic token, those should be the only random things there
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> "78 65 5b 06 00 00 ff ff ff ff 67 69 65 33 db"
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> "78 65 27 eb 00 00 ff ff ff ff 67 69 65 33 3e"
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> so yeah
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> buffer[2] and buffer[3] are random
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> and last byte
14:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> does it matter though?
14:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> As in, can I just set this to *anything*?
14:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> random should be fine iirc, but it's been a while since I touched that part of the code
14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> well
14:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> doesn't seem to respond (to me atleast)
15:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> thoughts?
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, you can try `debug 1`Â on the server to see if any error is triggered, or you can add some `dbg_msg` along the path. I need to go take care of some personal stuff
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> This sounds like a good idea, but how would you extract the list of established clients from the gameserver? Will you just keep the filter monitoring?
15:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Pretty much
15:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I won't really be able to explain the entire thing, but It'll be able to seperate connected players from other traffic 100%
15:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Was related to sport
16:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @FÃ¤n yes, can be set to anything
16:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> figured. tyvm
16:34 < afterfx> test 
16:35 <@heinrich5991> bye afterfx
16:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> man.
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm?
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> afterfx was already gone before I could say anything
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <denkbar> test unsuccessful then
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://skins.tw/how-to/ddnet-integration
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > This does not longer work with Steam. DDNet had to remove this feature for the steam version, since it conflicts terms of services.
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > You can still use the downloadable version on DDNet's website.
16:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we don't support `cl_skin_download_url` on steam?
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we do
16:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we just don't provide skins that's all
16:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @NeXus ^
17:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 could you test https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4095 on macos?
17:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, it's so hard to compile on macOS
17:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me give it a quick try
17:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> while you at it, can you test the client with HiDPI off?
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wÃ¶rk wÃ¶rk
17:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> to see if SDL fixed the weird bug i send a few weeks ago
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> wurk wurlk
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we abuse Learath, bcs no other macos dev that takes the time \<.\<
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> wurk wurk
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I do have macOS
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> but I cba
17:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do we even have another developer with macos?
17:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently FÃ¤n
17:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still have to do `sed -i "" 's/11\.0/10.15/g' CMakeCache.txt` so damn annoying
17:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> only "dev" i do on macOS is *sometimes* C in vscode
17:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> and I have to delete the bundled sdl so it will stop linking to it
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Can whoever is doing this
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> stop ddosing the server while I'm still working on it
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> <.<
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont even understand why its so hard to compile under macos \:D, we dont really have troublesome libs imo
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's macOS
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> everything is hard under macos
17:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok best argument
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> have to admit
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> pkg-config is provided by homebrew, which will cause wrong sdk paths to end up in the includes
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ok who ever tf is ddosing
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> stop it
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> get some help
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I'm trying to work here
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> <.<
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> isn't this like any normal day for you? ðŸ˜„
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> It is
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> but usually I don't work on it
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> but usually I don't work on it actively
17:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> while being attacked
17:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, #4095 doesn't work on macOS
17:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4095
17:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> not sure how to help you debug it though
17:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 `https://master2.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json failed. libcurl error: SSL certificate problem: certificate has expired` um why?
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª I think the problem is that the mouse isn't grabbed at all
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> looks fine from my side
17:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Expires on: December 23, 2021
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm looks fine on browser but libcurl doesn't agree
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> did you use bundled libs and update the git submodule?
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Learath2)
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't use bundled libs
17:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> libsdl doesn't include the required patch to even run on macOS without crashing instantly with SIGILL
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but ingame should still be grabbed shouldnt it?
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> guess thats the most important
17:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, also the cursor is out of sync with the desktop cursor
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so I can only get about halfway down the window before my desktop cursor peeks out the botto
17:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ingame is still grabbed properly
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh, guess we need someone with current SDL to test
17:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that sounds like bug that any SDL dev would instantly catch
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean my own version of sdl is 2.0.16
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well what did we add in our bundled build? I'll roll it up to master and add those too
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but this sounds like a bug that would affect anything in existence
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Learath2)
17:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anything that uses SDL
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it's not a new bug, other devs might have worked around it
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know what you do, so I don't know if it would affect everything that uses sdl
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> do you just take the position of the desktop cursor?
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > libsdl doesn't include the required patch to even run on macOS without crashing instantly with SIGILL
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also sounds pretty bad ðŸ˜›
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it just uses the desktop cursor pos relative to the window
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It will work if you compile with an older sdk, it makes appkit disable some asserts
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i also dunno what tsfreddie added with all this m\_ScreenHiDPIScale stuff
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> disabling highdpi fixes it
17:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it also makes things look pixellated though ðŸ˜„
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why cant we just fetch the window size and the canvas size in macos
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> also it's not the greatest experience since I can sort of escape the "grab"
17:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not really grabbing anything
17:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> let me try a patch, and you have to test xd
17:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well as long as you fetch it at the correct time it used to work just fine, which is why I was very skeptical when tsfreddie was doing the dpi stuff. I just didn't interfere because I didn't have the time to investigate or do it myself
17:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have not once in my life seen an airline as janky as brussels airlines
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I submit documents, the website says you'll receive an automated mail acknowledging the submission, I get no automated mail
17:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do you fail to implement an automatic mail, it's just a function call
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok pushed it
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i dunno `m_ScreenHiDPIScale` is a float
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont like to rely on floats
18:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this really needs an update some day
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> â„¢
18:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't like the fact that we need to even know about whether the underlying canvas is hidpi or not
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just split to canvas width/height and windows width/height
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Still doesn't work
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean for displaying resolutions its ok
18:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in menus?
18:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can only move the cursor on one quarter of the window, so it does line up with the 2x scaling this monitor has
18:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> in all menus
18:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh yeah, rip, can you test if it works on editor, just so i know the idea atleast works
18:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> editor works
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok, in menus it saves the state in a var, i'll update it
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we should also rename "screenwidth"
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its actually canvas width
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bit confusing
18:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is one more problem though
18:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mac CI is broken. `/Applications/Xcode_12.5.1.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX11.3.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Frameworks/QD.framework/Headers/ColorSyncDeprecated.h:1761:3: error: unknown type name 'ptrdiff_t'`
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk how best to show it but at the edges of the screen both the desktop and the teeworlds cursor are rendered
18:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/screen/window/
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I can take a look if you do a more verbose build
18:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd like to see CMakeCache.txt and the output of the compiler if you want to give it a go
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do I get a more verbose build? this is the output of the compiler: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/runs/3804985058
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think cmake --build --verbose works, but don't remember
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> or `make VERBOSE=1` is also usable
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> G
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> GER1 is now joinable on all versions
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ðŸ™‚
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice ðŸ™‚
18:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok updated
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just checked `ninja -v`Â is exactly the output I'm looking or
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> for*
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks!
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can confirm 0.7 works
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2\: i really dont want to annoy you, but could you also check if```c
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> // SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize reports HiDPI resolution even with SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI not set, which is wrong
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 	if(SdlFlags & SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI)
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 		SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize(m_pWindow, pCurrentWidth, pCurrentHeight);
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 	else
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 		SDL_GetWindowSize(m_pWindow, pCurrentWidth, pCurrentHeight);
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```in backend\_sdl.cppis really needed for non HiDPI
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its like the most random if branch we have
18:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> SDL\_GL\_GetDrawableSize should always give the canvas size
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a point in the startup where it will return the wrong size :/
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll check with dbg_msg in a second
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats a rather big bug in SDL imo then
18:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just cant imagine they didnt fixed it yet
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's more likely an issue in the way apple does gl
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but SDL could just internally check if HiDPI is on
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and if not, give the window size
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> having todo it on the user side is very counter intuitive
18:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, your latest push works fine
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> now I'll check th ebranch
18:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> the*
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, this happens right at startup, I think it's the bug I'm thinking of, but I'll print it out and check anyway
18:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> time to get SDL dev, so many things that confuse me
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it still triggers a window resize when the correct resolution is available btw, atleast on my resizing branch I never had to think about it after I started reacting on all resize events
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think i added support for the correct resize event
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but tsfreddie probably wants it for the HiDPI variable
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe we should just update that variable on the resize events
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Um, for me it behaves exactly as expected, @TsFreddie what did you see that made you add this?
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```[2021-10-05 18:19:46][dbg]: drawable w=2576 h=1798
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> [2021-10-05 18:19:46][dbg]: window w=1288 h=899``` this is with hidpi on
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you have to test it with off
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> with hidpi off it returns the same size for both, which is sane
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that sounds correct
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe he tried on SDL 2.0.14
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> what we really want there is the canvas size, right?
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and it got fixe
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll try just using that see if anything breaks
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually, can't possibly change anything since we use the drawable size when hidpi
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but isnt that expected?
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just use drawable size for both
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that would be the proper fix
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I mean me actually removing the branch is a useless test, since it can't possibly change anything
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i want it to be removed, bcs it isnt correct
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If we remove it lets wait for @TsFreddie to be around so he can check it out
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on linux the drawable size is smaller, e.g. if you have window decorations
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> e.g. close button
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Jupstar: any idea on the desktop and tw cursor both being displayed?
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it means you can interact with the decoration, which is very bad UX. you can resize the window, or move it around
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or better\: its not clear what the window manager does, when triggering a resize event by ourself
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> when does it happen?
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (@Learath2)
18:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> always?
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> in menus only
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in editor it works?
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, no it doesn't work there either
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> does `SDL_ShowCursor(false);`  fail maybe \:o?
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's very weirdly grabbed, like it's not really grabbed but something is at each tick moving the cursor back in bound
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wtf xD
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do they teleport the mouse? XD
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe some macOS restriction that they can't properly grab it? idk the apis you use, maybe check the functions see if they document any macOS quirks?
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know it's hard to get raw input on macOS
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well we use `SDL_SetWindowGrab` which sounds correct
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> like if I move my mouse quick enough it'll be outside for a split second
18:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> if I move it constantly around the edges it'll jitter in and out
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> alternativly dont grab the mouse at all under macos, dunno why this happens
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> how does it work in other games?
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ever played anything?
18:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me check factorio
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> why would anyone add a messenger link to their company website if they don't intend to have anyone actually watching the chat?
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> factorio doesn't grab the mouse at all, neither in-game nor in menus
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> though their gameplay doesn't require grabbing, ours does
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but ingame our grabbing works, doesnt it
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its really a matter of, if non ingame should grab
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, so we just don't grab in menus and it's fine I guess
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I even prefer not grabbing in menus and editor as I said in the PR
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah for editors sounds good tbh
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but yeah, i cant judge on it
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in non fullscreen no problem
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but in fullscreen it will minimize your app xD
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and windows + opengl = true love
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so maybe on not enable it on macos
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> since fullscreen doesnt work anyway?
18:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> wait what? on fullscreen if you don't grab it will minimize?
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no, clicking outside the window
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> will minimize your app
18:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah on macOS it won't
18:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah I see what you mean, I think even on macOS it would, you mean clicking desktop on a second screen, right?
18:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> which is why borderless fullscreen is superior
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in many things yes
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but it usually doesnt disable compositing
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so less fps, and fps is everything
18:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and ofc you couldn't play 5\:4, which some ppl do in this community
18:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't have a compositor even ðŸ˜›
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> macos might be fine, windows sucks, KDE too xd
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with wayland it worked perfect
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but wayland has forced vsync
18:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and rn my system crashes with wayland so cant test anyway xD
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought you need to play 4:3 stretched to be a pro
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i bet most of these ppl dont even know that they dont have 144hz using such resolutions anymore
18:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> one of the reasons i added support for it
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> did we update macos for the CI?
18:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or random fail
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not random
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Learath2 wanted to help me debug it, but I havne't gotten to it yet
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> feel free to try to debug it
18:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> looks like a SDK fail
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i just dont understand why it happens rn, what triggered it xd
18:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> looks like an sdk mixup to me, as in two different versions of the sdk getting both included, but I can't know for sure
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok on my local branch it works, i just need to build artifacts
18:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> not without seeing CMakeCache and/or the verbose build
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/runs/3805775384 I added output of CMakeCache.txt and verbose build (hopefully)
19:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll eat some dinner now though
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2\: for me it works with the cursor not being shown, only when i try to leave the window
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then i also get this jittering
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> on macOS?
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mojave
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> whatever version that is
19:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the jittering isnt nice, but i think its ok, the 5 users using macos have to live with it xDD
19:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice resizing works fine on macos too
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i really dont have any major bugs, except that i cant use fullscreen at all
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not even desktop fullscreen
19:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah wait
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on this build it even works
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> only not on the nightly built from ddnet.tw
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is the nightly still using the old libs @deen ?
19:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just want to be sure its  not our bundled libs
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2\: does "real" fullscreen not work for you?
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> nope
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok, then i guess its a driver bug
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn't render anything at all
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs it works with the software renderer
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it does grab all input including the touchpad though, so it's really hard to quit
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you need to blindly open the console and type quit
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok really weird
19:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wait do we even support real fullscreen
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah only if you restart?
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> / Todo SDL\: remove this when fixed (game freezes when losing focus in fullscreen)
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 			SDL\_SetWindowFullscreen(m\_pWindow, SDL\_WINDOW\_FULLSCREEN\_DESKTOP);
19:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh xd
19:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> No, nightly is using new libs, it takes them from ddnet/ddnet-libs master state
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i hope SDL doesnt detect that you use old SDKs or smth and gives a broken SDL
19:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs the SDL from brew works without problems
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know if my patch made it into 2.0.16 btw, if it did brew version should now work though
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mh, but fullscreen works
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> even on nightly now
19:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i hope it doesnt prefer the brew SDL and i am just confused
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> do `otool -L DDNet` and check what it linked to
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> on macOS it's like a dice roll what sdl gets linked to
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wait maybe it crashed bcs gfx\_resizable was 0 before
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> AHH
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> indeed
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gfx\_resizable 0 is evil
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> guess we should default it to 1 now, that it works anywhere anyway
19:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> or just remove it and always be 1?
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with gfx\_resizable 1 fullscreen works on macos for me
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also changing it on fly
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
19:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> even better
20:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 did you find anything in the log output?
20:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also had dinner
20:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me take a look now
20:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> aha, I see it
20:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ` PC_CURL_INCLUDEDIR:INTERNAL=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.sdk/usr/include`
20:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the new system protection stuff isn't letting us delete commandlinetools anymore
20:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can you try checking if it does get deleted after the rm -rf?
20:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> +
20:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ooooh sorry
20:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> my cat jus ttyped +
20:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is another reason it's a massive pain to compile on macOS btw, I have no idea what the correct way to do this is
20:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is there no stub like mingw? so its easy to cross compile and not always broken xd
20:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's also cross compilation for mac, but we'd like to be able to be compiled on mac, too
20:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but you can also use it on macos i guess? Xd
20:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> every time I encounter this issue I remember the temper tantrum the developer of homebrew threw because google didn't hire him
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you elaborate?
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> He failed a simple coding question, iirc it was reversing a linked list
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's very telling by the mess he created

20:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ```I wonder if the apple devs have nothing like a CI that catches such simple bugs
20:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean a missing typedef...  doesnt sound too hard to catch, some header swizzler, that makes sure every header has what it needs
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aha, newer commandlinetools actually makes this a symlink
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so, we should try not deleting this at all now
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Since it should correctly symlink to the proper place now
20:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> though I don't see how it could cause this issue :/
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh, it would probably symlink to the commandlinetools version of the sdk though, I don't really know what to do there
22:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> what even made the ddnet repo use the new macos sdk version?
22:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I just tested and my ddnet github repo uses an older version
22:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
22:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is it controlled by github -\> random?
22:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd think random
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't decide whether to take my laptop on vacation with me or not
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> flip a coin
