07:26 < bridge> <totar> Why is that? You can't rotate in the shader?
08:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Of course you can. But then i need to introduce a custom shader just for this single tile. Additionally the border rendering suffers a lot from heavy calculations
08:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> This method integrates cleanly into the new method and is very fast performance wise
10:34 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> ```pTarget->TakeDamage((vec2(0.f, -1.0f) + Temp) * Strength, g_pData->m_Weapons.m_Hammer.m_pBase->m_Damage,
10:34 < bridge> <he11owor1d.>                 m_pPlayer->GetCID(), m_Core.m_ActiveWeapon);```
10:34 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> 
10:34 < bridge> <he11owor1d.> how to determine which direction the player pressed for this function?
11:03 < bridge> <»Ƥϵtϵr> What is s client? XD
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
11:08 < bridge> <sedonya> Client with a focus on Customisation
11:09 < bridge> <sedonya> There's nothing cool about it yet, but I'll try to make it at least somewhat useful
11:09 < bridge> <»Ƥϵtϵr> Could you do it open source like tater client?
11:10 < bridge> <sedonya> No, that's the difference with Tater :owo:
11:10 < bridge> <»Ƥϵtϵr> Very sad
11:10 < bridge> <sedonya> If I wanted to make it open source, I wouldn't code anything, I'd just throw ideas at tater
11:11 < bridge> <»Ƥϵtϵr> Haha xD tater is more like just gores client
11:11 < bridge> <sedonya> Maybe :tee_thinking:
11:12 < bridge> <»Ƥϵtϵr> If your client would be open source i could copy paste it when i loke stuff into tater client xDD
11:12 < bridge> <sedonya> I want every client to be able to change it so that absolutely anyone can like it.
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats a bad diference then
11:14 < bridge> <sedonya> Not everyone likes to have their work copied, I don't mind helping people and giving them pieces of code, but giving out the whole code without a checklist is not the best option for me
11:14 < bridge> <»Ƥϵtϵr> Webdite where you can compile your own client with all nice feateres xD
11:14 < bridge> <»Ƥϵtϵr> Website where you can compile your own client with all nice features xD
11:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> you are using the whole ddnet code and u say this
11:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its a good way to not get ppl to use ur client
11:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wont use any closed source teeworlds related client
11:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wish ddnet used gpl
11:15 < bridge> <sedonya> Ddnet himself decided to make his code public, I have no such plans
11:16 < bridge> <sedonya> I don't really care how popular my client will be, there will always be 3-4 people for whom I will be happy to update the client
11:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> its ok u do u
11:17 < bridge> <sedonya> I don't use non open source clients either
11:18 < bridge> <ar1gin> i'd like to open-source my client but nobody will even look at it../
11:19 < bridge> <ar1gin> i'd like to open-source my client but nobody would even look at it../
11:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> why ppl always put this stupid argument
11:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> sorry im a lil mad
11:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> u all looking for tinies excuses to not do it xD
11:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> just do it
11:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-sfG8BV8wU
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html
11:21 < bridge> <ar1gin> but sensei... how do i fork a github repo on gitlab???
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> u git clone the github repo localy
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> and create aproject on gitlab
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> push it
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> and just say somewhere in the desc its a fork of X
11:21 < bridge> <ar1gin> but thats no good!
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> github is not git!
11:21 < bridge> <ar1gin> i'll have to update it manually!
11:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
11:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> u add the github as upstream
11:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> git remote add upstream <github url>
11:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> and make sure git remote add origin <gitlab url of ur fork>
11:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> i do this with ddnet
11:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> to update my fork to latest i do
11:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> git fetch upstream
11:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> git reset --hard upstream/master
11:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> git push
11:22 < bridge> <ar1gin> i do this every time with my local git repo
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> thats how git works
11:23 < bridge> <ar1gin> :pepeW:
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> if ur on linux
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> make a script
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> automate
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> or make a git alias
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> if you are on windows
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> im sorry for you
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
11:23 < bridge> <ar1gin> im linux guy
11:23 < bridge> <robyt3> If you'r on Windows, use same script with Git Bash
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
11:23 < bridge> <robyt3> If you're on Windows, use same script with Git Bash
11:24 < bridge> <ar1gin> but first!
11:24 < bridge> <ar1gin> i have to completely rebase everything i made
11:24 < bridge> <ar1gin> cuz i didnt use my gitlab name+mail in commits...
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> any reason u use gitlab?
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> let me find t he alternative i liked more
11:25 < bridge> <ar1gin> no? it's just pretty
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> check this one out https://codeberg.org/
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> github main advantage is it has biggest reach
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> if you dont need ppl to make pull requests or just tell them to email patches to u
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can use cgit
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> it looks like this https://git.edgarluque.com/
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the fastest interface
11:28 < bridge> <ar1gin> i was in search of a tool which allows me to organize my git projects and stumbled upon gitlab, tried to run it in a docker and somehow my free ram space went from 15gb to 3gb...
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah xd
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u want a lightweight but with features
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://about.gitea.com/
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i always used this
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Gitea is a painless self-hosted all-in-one software development service, it includes Git hosting, code review, team collaboration, package registry and CI/CD. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab.
11:29 < bridge> <ar1gin> :poggers2:
11:29 < bridge> <ar1gin> so.... where do i publish my code....
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> gitea is for self hosted btw
11:29 < bridge> <ar1gin> yeah i see
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> do u have a server
11:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> the easiest path is just github xd
11:30 < bridge> <ar1gin> no, not even a domain name

11:32 < bridge> <ar1gin> :poggers:
11:33 < bridge> <ar1gin> man i wish i had more willpower to code...
11:46 < bridge> <ar1gin> @ryozuki how do i keep track of the upstream codebase? do i create a special branch for it?
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> i told u
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> set upstream as a remote
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> remotes have name
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> when u clone it sets the remote "origin" to the one u cloned
11:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can add another remote
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> or 99
11:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches
11:48 < bridge> <ar1gin> yeah i know but...
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> c99
11:49 < bridge> <ar1gin> my previous workflow included pulling from github/master to local/master, `git checkout <mod branch>` and finally `git merge master`
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git remote add upstream https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git fetch --all
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git rebase upstream/master
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> clean version:
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git reset --hard upstream/master
11:58 < bridge> <ar1gin> jesus christ... 10000 code conflicts
12:04 < bridge> <ar1gin> i feel like i will have to completely redo everything
12:07 < bridge> <ar1gin> that's not clean at all!! i have to manually resolve every single commit now!
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it completely reset your branch
12:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u should only use it if u do a new feature or smth
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if u mean rebase.. it is normal that you have to resolve your conflicts
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what do u expect? XD
12:08 < bridge> <ar1gin> but
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u did rebase
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git rebase --abort
12:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can always stop rebasing
12:09 < bridge> <ar1gin> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1170318781768290345/image.png?ex=65589b4d&is=6546264d&hm=113d5365e5f5bc706336b2315dbf68fdb7fc24e063a833086c037abdf162fd7c&
12:09 < bridge> <ar1gin> this ^
12:09 < bridge> <ar1gin> i have to apply one commit at a time to fix this
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so what's your goal
12:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do u want to merge both?
12:10 < bridge> <ar1gin> i have my ducksmod branch which is ddnet's master + my changes merged
12:10 < bridge> <ar1gin> and the master branch is my ddnet fork
12:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok
12:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and what is your goal?
12:10 < bridge> <ar1gin> i wanna migrate changes from ducksmod to the fork
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok, does the fork also contain changes?
12:11 < bridge> <ar1gin> no, the fork is clean
12:11 < bridge> <ar1gin> i just made it
12:11 < bridge> <ar1gin> ducksmod was developed locally
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok. what you want is this:
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git reset --hard origin/ducksmod
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> git rebase upstream/master
12:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u reset to your mod and then u rebase your mod to the current ddnet master
12:12 < bridge> <ar1gin> 🤔
12:12 < bridge> <ar1gin> okay thankies 👍
12:12 < bridge> <ar1gin> git is still a big mystery to me

13:36 < bridge> <ar1gin> after a whole hour of struggling, i finally fixed my code conflicts :pepeW:
14:31 < bridge> <ar1gin> for anyone interested -> <https://github.com/Ar1gin/duck-ddnet>
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @robyt3 wtf how long has that been broken?
14:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the mipmap stuff
14:33 < bridge> <robyt3> Not too long I think, was likely also broken by me
14:33 < bridge> <robyt3> There used to be a separate parameter for the texture load format which was removed
14:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i c
14:33 < bridge> <robyt3> I guess I missed these uses the last time
14:34 < bridge> <robyt3> I couldn't notice any difference in screenshots with and without mipmaps for menu images and for assets in the menus
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but doesnt it also affect normal sprites?
14:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i don't notice it anyway bcs of my screen resolution xd
14:36 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, I didn't test that in detail, but it seems nobody noticed
14:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> funny xd
14:38 < bridge> <patiga> this video was reposted on the godot discord a couple of times https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzrw6_KDMl4

16:13 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> the way she speaks is like shes always talking down to you
16:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> i mostly didnt care about her commentary, just wanted to see the results

16:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the results are a bit one sided, where the design is the same on all pages and has that web design thing on it

16:16 < bridge> <cellegenrih> btw the only things that are actually makes sense changing are the wishlist and the community page
16:17 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I kinda use wishlist, but it's lacking stuff which she mentioned. about the community page, it's like half of the stuff is not needed, without them it would work the same way
16:18 < ChillerDragon> @ar1gin those aimlines in your client could be considered a cheat i guess

16:23 < bridge> <ar1gin> yeah its technically a cheat... i use it to troll my friends most of the time though, and i doubt that this will make a huge problem like aimbot. this feature also lets me find interesting rocket throws quickly. my client is also lacking a lot of features other cool clients have so i doubt anyone will actually use it, and besides that, it's very easy to implement this
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so basically not at all during the video
16:24 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i skipped to the results

23:18 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ive seen this
23:18 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> looks so fun
23:19 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i dont understand bevy
23:19 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> from what ive seen its literally just a blank slate until you code it yourself
23:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> bevy is a game engine
23:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> but it doesnt have a editor
23:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> like godot
23:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> its like teeworlds engine
23:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> but well thought
23:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> and generic
23:20 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> 🤔
23:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> the most unique thing about bevy is the ECS system
23:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> it gives it good paralelism
23:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> > involves breaking your program up into Entities, Components, and Systems. Entities are unique “things” that are assigned groups of Components, which are then processed using Systems.
23:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
23:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> > For example, one entity might have a Position and Velocity component, whereas another entity might have a Position and UI component. You might have a movement system that runs on all entities with a Position and Velocity component.
23:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
23:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> > The ECS pattern encourages clean, decoupled designs by forcing you to break up your app data and logic into its core components. It also helps make your code faster by optimizing memory access patterns and making parallelism easier.
