21:13 <@deen> correct

21:13 <@EastByte> deen: what about another map layer for map progress/percentage
21:13 <@EastByte> deen: what about another map layer for map progress/percentage
21:13 <@EastByte> so the server knows how far a player is

21:13 <@EastByte> might be cool for tournaments

21:13 <@deen> please no
21:13 <@deen> please no
21:14 <@deen> should just use checkpoints
21:14 <@deen> should just use checkpoints
21:14 <@deen> and give me a way to sort players by checkpoint
21:14 <@deen> and give me a way to sort players by checkpoint
21:14 <@deen> you can do that, would be cool for tournament
21:14 <@deen> you can do that, would be cool for tournament
21:14 <@EastByte> first have to check how checkpoints actually are mapped

21:15 <@deen> just as a line you walk over

21:15 <@deen> tiles

21:15 <@EastByte> do they have an id?

21:15 <@deen> what do you mean?
21:15 <@deen> what do you mean?
21:16 21:16 <@EastByte> how does the server know which checkpoint relates to which point<@EastByte> how does the server know which checkpoint relates to which point

21:16 <@deen> ehm, look at the game tiles
21:16 <@deen> ehm, look at the game tiles
21:16 <@deen> there are 25 checkpoint tiles
21:16 <@deen> there are 25 checkpoint tiles
21:16 <@EastByte> are therer
21:16 <@EastByte> are therer
21:19 <@EastByte> ah
21:19 <@EastByte> ah
21:19 <@EastByte> so the server just needs to check which checkpoint ids are being used in the map
21:19 <@EastByte> so the server just needs to check which checkpoint ids are being used in the map
21:20 <@deen> not even that
21:20 <@deen> not even that
21:20 <@deen> each character already stores the last checkpoint you touched, i think
21:20 <@deen> each character already stores the last checkpoint you touched, i think
21:20 <@deen> so you just need a way to output that

21:20 <@deen> in rcon console

21:20 <@deen> sorted

21:20 <@EastByte> yea but we don't know which represents which percentage of the map
21:20 <@EastByte> yea but we don't know which represents which percentage of the map
21:21 <@deen> doesn't matter all that much
21:21 <@deen> doesn't matter all that much
21:21 <@deen> i just look how many checkpoints there are
21:21 <@deen> i just look how many checkpoints there are
21:21 <@deen> and i know
21:21 <@deen> and i know
21:21 <@deen> last one should be before finish, easy to find
21:21 <@deen> last one should be before finish, easy to find
21:21 <@EastByte> yea
21:21 <@EastByte> yea
21:25 <@EastByte> so when a player enters a new checkpoint the checkpoint id will be logged to rcon
21:25 <@EastByte> so when a player enters a new checkpoint the checkpoint id will be logged to rcon
21:25 <@EastByte> and you can use that to make some graph
21:25 <@EastByte> and you can use that to make some graph
21:26 <@deen> hm, no
21:26 <@deen> hm, no
21:26 <@deen> sounds bad
21:26 <@deen> sounds bad
21:27 <@deen> would need a tool to collect the checkpoint ids from all serves =/
21:27 <@deen> would need a tool to collect the checkpoint ids from all serves =/
21:27 <@EastByte> you talked about rcon :p
21:27 <@EastByte> you talked about rcon :p
21:28 <@deen> yeah, so i can f2 and type "fastest" and get a list of the players sorted by checkpoint
21:28 <@deen> yeah, so i can f2 and type "fastest" and get a list of the players sorted by checkpoint
21:28 <@EastByte> a the graph was my idea, right

21:36 <@EastByte> would be cool I think

21:36 <@EastByte> not sure about that

21:37 <@deen> yes,that's an interesting idea as well
