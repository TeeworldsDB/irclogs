00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <xiscordz> Hello good night I have a problem that when I go to any ddnet map it keeps connecting infinite (I'm from Brazil, Alagoas) and it doesn't connect. @Moderator
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> something wrong with the mastersevers? I can't connect my homeserver oO `[2022-06-16 00:22:53][register/6/ipv6]: ERROR: the master server reports that clients can not connect to this server.
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> [2022-06-16 00:22:53][register/6/ipv6]: ERROR: configure your firewall/nat to let through udp on port 8303.`
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> And yes i know, i need to have the portforwarding, but I have already done this
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it only ipv6 that it's complaining about?
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then you might only have allowed your port on ipv4?
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> `[2022-06-16 00:30:06][http]: https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/register failed. libcurl error: The requested URL returned error: 400` I have never seen this one
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> yes only ipv6 is complaining
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that shouldn't happen
00:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on newest version?
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> kinda, on a modded version
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> just material modded, not network
08:22 <+ChillerDragon> why are clannames sometimes chop off in scoreboard and suffied with "..." ?
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> bcs the scoreboard is too small
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or the font size is too big
08:24 <+ChillerDragon> but it used to fit in there? same resolution and font size
08:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> :/
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i called it XD
08:25 <+ChillerDragon> ofc u did
08:25 <+ChillerDragon> u also called my 15% amd gain o.O
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i just knew someone would be affected by it 😄
08:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez amd
08:26 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1655360776.png
08:26 <+ChillerDragon> those two bois were cut off a sec ago. Probably some dudes joined and it switched to the two sided scorevoard with smaller font then it fully displayed their clans again
08:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
08:27 <+ChillerDragon> not very long clans imo
08:27 <+ChillerDragon> i assume this "fix" was made for our friend the "WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW" xD
08:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and clan is most important too 😄
08:28 <+ChillerDragon> well this poor ad bridge cant spread the virus when the last characters are visible so its business critical
08:28 <+ChillerDragon> anrent'
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i have to say, i dont even find a bigger scoreboard that ugly
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/986880968654721024/unknown.png
08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> (text not fixed)
08:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think it looks fine too
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no reason to have it so tiny since it already obstructs the screen
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> If the clan is empty, you may can render a bigger name 🤔 but that's just me being crazy, Keep it simple stupid
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can anyone review https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5412 ? Otherwise it will conflict with every translation PR
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In a community that loves their weird UB, I expect no less than 3 people getting affected badly by any change
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD tru story
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think the only change I never got any complaints with was the http map downloader
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Prestilia> For those of you that  haven't heard about Bitcoin and those that have heard about Bitcoin and are interested in investing on it contact me and I will teach you the full details of it so that you can start making your profit
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao, chillerdragon on attention seeking again
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> more like daydrinking again
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> did it ping u 10 times again and sent u 10 mails? xd
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sadly u forgot to ping me
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @louis do you want me to write something for #📬submit-skins ? nothing fancy though
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> does it work in lagacy display resolutions?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> does it work in legacy display resolutions?
11:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its smaller than 2 scoreboards
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> there was also one suggestion to just display the clan below the player name ^^ would also work
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> <.<
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> most ppl only read clans in scoreboard
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xDDD
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it should be special
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I normaly never read clan ^^
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i always read them
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I normally never read clan ^^
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but not in the nameplate
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> only in scoreboard
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and in vanilla mods when round is over
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and u are first place
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u see, ah nice he's from that clan
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ^^
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes probably some use it ... At least all players that use clans seriously
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
11:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @Chairn Is it ok to address  your refactoring requests in another PR. Because they are not specific to my PR, but the problem was there already before 😄 Or do you want me that I scan somhow the code for all wrong array prefixes. And the refactoring of the asset menu should also be done in a more serious PR.
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could change the array prefixes only in the structs you added
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @c0d3d3v why do you think passing the version to a function `SendChatTarget` is cleaner than doing the version check at the call site?
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems to me that it's better to do the check locally, you immediately see what it does
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you don't get that from a random parameter of a function
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But I do get it from the parameter. My IDE tells me the name of the parameter, and that is very verbose written.
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ... ok
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't get that in my coding environment, and it's also not visible on github, etc.
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in git diffs
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Also the version we add as parameter is verbose. We all know it is a Enum for version number...
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Do you not think it is code duplication?
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> To add everywhere the same condition
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and even if we had explicit parameter passing like `SendChatTarget(1, OnlyForVersionGreaterThan=5)`, it seems weird to not just check it locally
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> Asks for review, merges anyway lol
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean you can add a function for specifically this if you absolutely want to, but it's just one if everywhere, no?
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> murpi reviewed it
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> yeah and I found at least 3 issues 🙈
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to me, a single if is clearer than a parameter to some function, where I have to read some non-local code
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> 25 conditions around the same function, only difrent message to send
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd prefer `if(x < 5) DoFunction()` over `DoFunctionIfLessThan(5)`
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the left is a programming language native construct that is easy to understand
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But why
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the right thing is a function that could do anything
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> You should not do checks for something 25 times that should be done by the worker that needs to carry out the operation
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (if you absolutely want to, you could add a function that does what you want, but I think overloading the `SendChatTarget` function isn't really nice)
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but what does "send chat target" have to do with version checks?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Why we then added the flag field to that function
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> to send some messages to version 6 cleints and some to version 7
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> thats the same thing
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> should I also remove the flags?
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I could also add only one flag to that flag field
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> xD do not send to that specific version
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess a flag there for OLDHUD would be fine-ish
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the CHAT_SIX stuff at least uses the -1 thing, i.e. it can't simply be lifted out of the function
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> @Not Keks I reviewed on the old branch, I posted the veiew in the new one ^.^
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if you want, you can also use my pr and fix more stuff
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i only skipped through them and fixed some obvious stuff
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> havent looked deeper into it, i kinda also dont really like some "forced" translations
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Like "Karte" instead of "Map"
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nobody uses that in german
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Your code style is really strange xD why would I write everything 20times, if I could do the same thing with only one argument more.
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Its the same in the asset menu. Every second line is duplication, If I would refactoring it, I would not like to have any duplication at all.
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not always so easy
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it already uses templates to minimize some code
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> time vs effort
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @c0d3d3v I don't like to put unrelated concerns into functions, especially if they can easily be factored out
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I prefer DoX and DoY over DoXAndY
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> alternatively you could use lambdas :p
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Essigautomat can you elaborate where you want to use lambdas here?
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I would like OOP more then templates, but seems like I'm an other generation :/
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in assets it makes sense 😄
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> That was a bad joke 🙈 sorry
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but what do u want to OOP?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lambdas can do some magic here
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> at least to minimize code
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> every tab uses the same method...
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dunno about readability
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> doesnt that sound good? xd
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> e.g. would you refactor this code:
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ```c++
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> char aBuff[IO_MAX_PATH_LENGTH];
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>     if(str_comp(pAssetItem->m_aName, "default") == 0)
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>     {
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>         str_format(aBuff, sizeof(aBuff), "%s.png", pAssetName);
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>         CImageInfo ImgInfo;
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>         if(pGraphics->LoadPNG(&ImgInfo, aBuff, IStorage::TYPE_ALL))
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>         {
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>             pAssetItem->m_RenderTexture = pGraphics->LoadTextureRaw(ImgInfo.m_Width, ImgInfo.m_Height, ImgInfo.m_Format, ImgInfo.m_pData, ImgInfo.m_Format, 0);
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>             pGraphics->FreePNG(&ImgInfo);
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>         }
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>     }
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>     else
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>     {
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>         str_format(aBuff, sizeof(aBuff), "assets/%s/%s.png", pAssetName, pAssetItem->m_aName);
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>         CImageInfo ImgInfo;
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>         if(pGraphics->LoadPNG(&ImgInfo, aBuff, IStorage::TYPE_ALL))
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>         {
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>             pAssetItem->m_RenderTexture = pGraphics->LoadTextureRaw(ImgInfo.m_Width, ImgInfo.m_Height, ImgInfo.m_Format, ImgInfo.m_pData, ImgInfo.m_Format, 0);
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>             pGraphics->FreePNG(&ImgInfo);
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>         }
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>         else
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>         {
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>             str_format(aBuff, sizeof(aBuff), "assets/%s/%s/%s.png", pAssetName, pAssetItem->m_aName, pAssetName);
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>             if(pGraphics->LoadPNG(&ImgInfo, aBuff, IStorage::TYPE_ALL))
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>             {
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>                 pAssetItem->m_RenderTexture = pGraphics->LoadTextureRaw(ImgInfo.m_Width, ImgInfo.m_Height, ImgInfo.m_Format, ImgInfo.m_pData, ImgInfo.m_Format, 0);
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar>                 pGraphics->FreePNG(&ImgInfo);
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I would think so. If I have one class that I init with specif parameters, asset name, title ... path.. And init for example 5  objects that belong to the asset menu tab, then I have only one class with only one set of functions
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> might look like its lot of same code
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but in the end its still a big ddifnfernt
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but for example entities allow dirs or PNGs
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> while other assets only allow PNGs
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but go ahead and refactor it
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but in the end its still a bit ddifnfernt
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> all use the same function... could be one function of a asset_tab_class
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/986939257224593488/unknown.png
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> (except for enteties)
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats a spot where i nowadays would use lambdas
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or templates
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but why classes?
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> yes thats whhy I would use OOP instead of templates
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well anyway, just do it
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> `void LoadPNGFromPath(char* aBuf, idkthetype* RenderTexture)`
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> not now
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the reason is simple:
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not worth the effort
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> in the past at least
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> now we have extras and HUD
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I only want to finish the HUD stuff. Refactoring can be done later xD
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> see
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats my point
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its always a question of time
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> But there would be no reason to refactor it, if it would have been oop in first place...
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> but ye everything is historicly groun
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> grown*
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> until u need smth the other stuff doesnt need
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not like u never refactor OOP
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> first there was only a entities tab... so ye would not have made sense
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just to be clear i'd use OOP in many places always depends if its worth it
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btw this is actually a good case where i'd bind parameters
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but e.g. ListDirectory doesnt allow this
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it only allows C functions
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so also refactor this ;P
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but it allows a user
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so i guess u can hack in an object
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> So should I remove the flags too? 
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> Or better just tell me what I should do. I do not fight anymore ^^ I will do it.
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> IMO, you can move it to flags, you can create another function, or check it locally
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @c0d3d3v I didnt know what exactly you meant yesterday I think, but I think a flag for the freezebar from the server aswell as a flag for the stars to be rendered clientside with the ninja skin will be the way to go. Either you can add it to your pr, or I would add it for you to copy
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then we could simply add a chat command to toggle and a client option that sends this option ?
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Idk:(
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 lets make a vote :(
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Democracy
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps we could get an actual freeze animation
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't have a good idea for it
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how to do it with arbitrarily shaped skins
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> there were thoughts of an "ice" block above the skin, also you could simply color the player different and add particles (just some thoughts)
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 😭
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but where do we get an ice block that fits arbitrary skins? ^^
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> this one should do: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/enfuturama/images/7/74/GiantIceCube.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090629004813
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 I might have a very valid argument
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Look
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> jokes aside, aren't skins limited in their size?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I personally always played with show ninja 0.
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Is that now also impossible for freeze?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i really liked the combination of ninja weapon, normal skin, and the stars
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> That way I could always see who is who in freeze
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and I could better decide, so its part of my gameplay.
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that would also be served by putting an ice block around people, no?
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, i am colorblind and cant see colors on first frame
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I need to inspect colors a bit in order to see them or to differntiatw
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats why it always helped me
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the ice block would probably change the color a bit. that would make it harder to distinguish?
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> At least during fast gameplay, yes.
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And when names are cramped together tee by tee, i can also not view them
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I imagine a freezebar in such situations as very ugly and uncomforting aswell
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think the freeze bar can be disabled when the tee is still in freeze
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats good
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But yeah, the ninja + real skin was epic for me
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> + helped
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I would find it great if we could get away from ninja and move to something freezy
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sure, but its such a good way of seeing the tee in freezepits
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> as the skin is rendered without any extra layers
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> just the ninja weapon behind it, which could be "removed"
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe that would be a toggleable option @c0d3d3v ? rendering normal skin in freeze, with new freeze particles and so on, and maybe the stars?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please don't add more options
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why do you want to have the stars, specifically?
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they don't seem to add anything
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mostly design, but yea, i think i can live without them
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> rendering normal skin as frozen is important gameplay!!
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if we do decide to add it, the burden shouldn't be on @c0d3d3v to add it
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (because this is precisely why options are bad, they put burden on people changing things)
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i sed
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> tw just died today
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> imagine again ddnet with moving tiles, so much more new map designs
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @fokkonaut tw never dies
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> The cleanest most work intense solution might be a frozen skin for each skin. And if you don't possess the frozen version, it defaults back to the default skin frozen version. But I think you'd gain to little for all the work
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 2054 i'll host my v0.14 server
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye same but
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :/
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i want to update my client always, but those things make it hard for me to update i am honest
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 we even have a config for the old chat system? why? because some people might prefer it. And why wouldnt we allow it in this case?
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> when there is even a real reason, because it heavily affects gameplay
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and especially in teeworlds single gameplay changes can affect your whole play style :/
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think you're overstating this design change a lot. it'd probably be "just normal" in a month
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i know what you mean, but i really need skin visibility
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We have a config for the old chat because I didn't want to get shot by konsti on my way to the supermarket
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> now be scared of me !
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :pepeH:
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> the CTuneParams class is so ugly, as soon as you add a virtual function, it's size is different and some other related code breaks
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> the CTuneParams class is so ugly, as soon as you add a virtual function, its size is different and some other related code breaks
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> add a function for the size and use that in the breaking parts
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> doesn't work, because it gets interpreted into an int array and the sequence might be compiler/os depended, idk
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what approach did you take?
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> to fix it? Inherit from it and add the virtual functions in the derived class
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can i see it?
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> ?
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> ```
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> class CMatDefault : public CTuneParams  //CTuneParams is not allowed to contain virtual functions
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> {
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> public:
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee>     CMatDefault() = default;
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee>     virtual int GetSkidSound();
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee>     virtual float GetSkidThreshold() { return 500.0f; }
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee>     virtual float GetDynamicAcceleration(float Velocity) { return m_GroundControlAccel; }
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> };
14:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> ```
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> tbh that's less of a fix and more of a workaround 😄
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont know what exactly the problem is, i believe
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> this is a very evil function (which is actually wrong, too): https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/edab7c0e8c25ea52384801674f05dcd3b12aaca8/src/game/gamecore.h#L56
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> also this part, it's equally bad (and also wrong) https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/edab7c0e8c25ea52384801674f05dcd3b12aaca8/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L690
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah!
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i see
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> adding a virtual function to CTuneParams makes the class bigger and in turn breaks this code parts, also in both cases it should be sizeof(CTuneParams)
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> adding a virtual function to CTuneParams makes the class bigger and in turn breaks this code parts, also in both cases it should be sizeof(CTuneParams) instead of sizeof(int)
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yep
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> genius
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, that thing is absolutely awful
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Smh c++
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not C++'s fault matricks decided he didnt care what the standard has to say
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES3_SusAlt:
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> when it's nearly 15 o'clock, you programm all day and notice, that you may need something to eat
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> when it's nearly 15 o'clock, you programm all day and notice, that you may need something to breakfast
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 is there an easy way for me to implement the reliable server registering without applying the whole register refactor?
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I usually notice when I get a massive hunger headache :D
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> exactly 🙈
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you only need to do regular post requests, see the description of this PR how they look like: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5064
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if youre willing to, it would be nice
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thanks, uhm :D
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i'll see if i can get it to work
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @murpi mvp
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when learn python programming @louis? 😛
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ```py
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> import discord
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if messageIsValid()
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis>     addReactions()
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ```
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think that should work
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> missing colon in line 2
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but otherwise great, let's ship it 😉
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i tried to write a python script to automatically generate gores maps that wouldnt be too distinguishable from a human-made map
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it got pretty disgusting quickly though
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> @louis I did something similar, but in C++ and for dungeons, if you want the repo tell me ^^
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I want to take a look at it
15:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> oh ghod
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> oh god
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i force pushed to this
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5424
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @cauldron I let the CI run. if there's style checker problems, can I add them to your PR so you don't have to deal with it?
15:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> sure, but this time i let the python script run ;D
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah nice 🙂
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5423
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5424
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the if looked a bit weird, I hadn't guessed that this is what clang-format wants
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> well, maybe check again, and maybe it's not the best way, but in the range of the python script. i put it on newline but the script put it back on one line.
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> \❌
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> how to add the clang-format or the python fix styling script to vscode, so that is formats everytime you save?
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> Is it possible that there is no code for movin a directory in the storage code? :(
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, maybe https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format @cauldron
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: does RenameFile not work?
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> it sounds like file i didnt test it
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> also in the `rename` manpage it talks about files
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `rename` isn't limited to files in linux
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> but yea isnt everything a file in linux?
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> even folders?
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> xd
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> ok maybe renamefile works then
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk about windows though
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> force pushed again
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I guess it's fine there, as well
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> yikers
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> `MoveFileExW`
16:10 <+ChillerDragon> windows .-.
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's backward compatible 😉
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean, on linux the syscall is called `renameat2` 😛
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> yea should work
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> fingers crossed
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> heinrich is if checking from left to right or right to left?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <陪我> @louis done
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <陪我> the bot should auto-react and auto-yeet all messages not following the format
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> its not "sheep" by unknown? xdd
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @cauldron left to right
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also get rid of the newline in the condition, please @cauldron
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <陪我> did you make it? I can't remember 😄
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> i found it but idk who made it
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <陪我> I spent like an hour to figure out how to restrict certain reactions for specific roles, just to learn we can restrict reactions from discord directly
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <陪我> emotional damage
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> and also what comes first || or && because i did ( cond1 || (cond2 && cond3)) 😅
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> and also what comes first `|| or && because i did ( cond1 || (cond2 && cond3))` 😅
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> and also what comes first `|| or &&` because i did `( cond1 || (cond2 && cond3))` 😅
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this evaluates left to right
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it first checks cond1, if it's true, it stops evaluating
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise it checks cond2, if it's false, it stops evaluating
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise it checks cond3\
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise it checks cond3
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> yes, but if i do `(cond1 || cond2 && cond3)` what then?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i guess `&&` comes first because its 'stronger"?
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i guess `&&` comes first because its 'stronger'?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `(cond1 || cond2 && cond3)` is the same as `(cond1 || (cond2 && cond3))`
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but write parentheses, it makes the intent clearer ^^
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but that would be different just for the record `((cond1 || cond2) && cond3)`
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ok
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> thank u ^^
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> is it possible that clang tidy has false positives?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> please be more specific
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> probably yes
17:00 <+ChillerDragon> woot how
17:00 <+ChillerDragon> i thought its da best of the best
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its a static analyzer
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it sometimes assumes stuff
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> the only one I know is about object slicing (if you want it)
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ```C
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> CCharacter *pChar = ChatHelper()->GameClient()->m_GameWorld.GetCharacterByID(ChatHelper()->GameClient()->m_LocalIDs[g_Config.m_ClDummy]);
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 			if(pChar)
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 				continue;
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> 			vec2 Self = pChar->m_Pos;
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ```
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thats just wrong
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if(pchar) continue
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> looks really wrong
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah lol
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i want !
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> xd
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea i knew it
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> never clang gets something so simple wrong
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if the pChar comes from other libs for example it might actually do this
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but the compiler should see it too actually
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> you can overwrite the pointer operator and make the code above work
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dunno if that works, but best idea 2022
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just invert all logic
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> jupstar u got some free music for me?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> let me google CC0 music
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> omagawd
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> not CC0
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> free to listen to
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Anthem_of_Europe_(US_Navy_instrumental_short_version).ogg
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> here
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> public domain
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lmao my pipeline was actually catching the issue as well but my tests are not that ellaborate xd
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> omagawd
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> something thats nice to listen to
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u dont like bethooven?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> bitsh wat u would listen to
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> niet
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> suka
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its the best german musican
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> all nazis
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> back them the world was smth else
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> send me ur fav playlist or riot
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok let me see
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i like anime soundtracks alot, bcs im weeb
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> game music also nice often
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am more instrumental guy u know
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> try me
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u hear 2 songs at the same time
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and call it a new song
17:11 <+ChillerDragon> ping
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pong
17:12 <+ChillerDragon> matrix is so broken time to kill it again
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why is it broken?
17:14 <+ChillerDragon> its super slow. It cant be killed without running `pkill -f electron` it loses messages. It messes up message order.
17:15 <+ChillerDragon> maybe its an element issue and i should try getting matrix into my weechat which is use for irc
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the only annoying thing is, that the bridge has such huge delay sometimes
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> makes it unusable when talkn to smbdy
17:15 <+ChillerDragon> i never notice that from irc
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> @heinrich5991 does the server require now ipv6 btw?
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> or can I set it up for only ipv4 somehow
17:42 <+ChillerDragon> jopstar where dj
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno where u are
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> probs in some holidays xd
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> yes, with sv_ipv4only 1, feedback is missing, like sending heartbeats oO
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> i mean u 
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> when send songs
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i said i mostly hear instrumental music lmao
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> i said try me
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no idea what to pick, sometimes i hear this, then that u know
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not like i have a playlist 😄
17:51 <+ChillerDragon> hrmpf
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> Is anyone interested in testing materials with me? I merged all I have together and maybe need some feedback now
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Sure, it's not that important 😉
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> u got some server to connect to?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> yes, a home server, but you need a custom client
17:56 <+ChillerDragon> is it public?
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> by customclient u mean #5313 ?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> can you see this workflow? https://github.com/AssassinTee/ddnet/runs/6921876190?check_suite_focus=true
17:57 <+ChillerDragon> ye
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I am just waiting for the artifacts 🙂
17:58 <+ChillerDragon> gh atrifacts is M$ maleware axaxax
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> You think my at home compiled client is more secure?
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> yes
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not if u use MSVC xd
18:01 <+ChillerDragon> dont u?
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> axaxax MSVC
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> no, CLion
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> does CLion have its own compiler?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> probably gcc
18:02 <+ChillerDragon> poggies
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but github actions is widely used, makes it less likely to contain weird software
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> @AssassinTee yea i think im too lazy to build the pr rn i thought u wanted to test something on current master and i could quickly join a pub server
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> you don't need to build the PR, i am just stupid atm
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> what a statement @Jupstar xd
18:03 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar windows is also widley used
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean in open source community
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> would damage their image
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> im even less likley to run a binary you send me xd
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> which image?
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> we all think that m$ is stealing our closed src code and feeding it into code pilot
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for being more open source friendly lately
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> gh it self is still closed src
18:04 <+ChillerDragon> ms open src is just meme 
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> depends
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> but yea i get what you mean vscode etc
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> typescript
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> da
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how about hating m$ but still respect their open source projects
18:05 <+ChillerDragon> im in
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> but i dont trust their pipeline xd
18:06 <+ChillerDragon> the binarys probably install a windows bootloader on my system
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i doubt they care tooo much about the artifacts
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> remember, company does only things where it can get much money
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and artifacts are probs not too hugely used in industry xd
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> artifacts are behind account wall
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> so next summer when github accounts cosz 10$ artifacts are literally e-gold
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lmao
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> where did u get that from
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> xd
18:07 <+ChillerDragon> i made it up 
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that would instant kill github xxD
18:08 <+ChillerDragon> i would still buy
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> Watch this ad in order to start your github actions workflow
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but no student would
18:08 <+ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
18:10 <+ChillerDragon> since im uploading these logs to gh they will parse that shit and only make me pay to keep my account
18:10 <+ChillerDragon> @microsoft I WONT!
18:11 <+ChillerDragon> spawns are deterministic right? Always closest spawn to 0/0 is used first on empty server
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> y
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> ur pipeline failed nob
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I mean technically everything is deterministic, because it's running on a computer, but I know what you mean
18:13 <+ChillerDragon> omg cringe CS
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> ye ik, already updated
18:14 <+ChillerDragon> this boi? https://github.com/AssassinTee/ddnet/tree/feature/all-materials-experimental
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> ?
18:15 <+ChillerDragon> i still dont know which branch u work on
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> yes that's the branch, the current pipeline is still running since 10 minutes
18:15 <+ChillerDragon> ah yea but style alr failed
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> look again at your link
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> and therefore software can't compile?
18:15 <+ChillerDragon> YES
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I hope you don't have macos
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> https://github.com/AssassinTee/ddnet/actions/runs/2510253176

18:23 <+ChillerDragon> or only to see materials?
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> to see materials and to have valid predictions
18:23 <+ChillerDragon> i cant join wetefek
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> and if you only have ipv6 then I can't help you 😦

18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/987031031469183006/screenshot_2022-06-16_18-28-41.png
18:29 <+ChillerDragon> wot
18:29 <+ChillerDragon> why does it look like ass for me?
18:29 <+ChillerDragon> i got ur sus client
18:29 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1655396985.png
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> what is in data/entities/entities_clear/ddnet-materials ?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> wtf
18:30 <+ChillerDragon> there is no data/entities
18:30 <+ChillerDragon> is ur cmake working?
18:30 <+ChillerDragon> lemme check
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> what is in data/editor/entities_clear/ddnet-materials ?
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> /editor
18:31 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1655397060.png
18:31 <+ChillerDragon> hmmm
18:36 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/AssassinTee/ddnet/blob/41a960117b3deff5c9075cdbe7ab29a6554d8b3c/src/game/client/components/maplayers.cpp#L2047
18:36 <+ChillerDragon> i think i could end up in this branc
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> every layer does that and I don't know why xD
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> ah I see, it's copy pasta probably maybe
18:39 <+ChillerDragon> unitinilaized variable nob
18:39 <+ChillerDragon> `m_MaterialIsLoaded` should be set to false
18:39 <+ChillerDragon> in constructuror
18:44 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1655397868.png
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> daran wirds wahrscheinlich auch liegen
18:50 <+ChillerDragon> :de:
18:50 <+ChillerDragon> :beer:
18:50 <+ChillerDragon> yea if u get the wrong compiler/setting this might not work. But i think modern c++ should init bools to false. Probably not the only place ddnet depends on that
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> yes, you are probably right
19:08 <+ChillerDragon> i barley map these days so idk but did editor sense get slower?
19:11 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea WAYYY SLOWER
19:11 <+ChillerDragon> hrmpf
19:11 <+ChillerDragon> @robyt i guess this is a feature? -.-
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> am i the only one to have segfault on latest master?
19:11 <+ChillerDragon> server or client?
19:11 <+ChillerDragon> i get none in client
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> client
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> on windows
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's in vulkan backend, but nothing has changed there recently?
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hmm, i blame robyt, still have to check, looks like new readfile function might fail weirdly
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why is murpii better in german then rest of us? isnt he like hungerian or smth
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why is murpii better in german than rest of us? isnt he like hungerian or smth
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> my german is horrendous, alot of people would disagree but I think growing up in a multilingual household is a huge nerf
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> where do i download artifacts on github?
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i wanna try windows build from robyt's pr
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> klick on the gh action and then choose a build
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and they are groupped
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> click on the group
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/987048227771658340/unknown.png
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> lol, it just didnt scroll with my mpousewheel...
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ok, the github page is bugged i think:
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/actions/runs/2507725847> can you scroll ?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dunno what u mean with scroll up
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it desotn even fill my whole mintor
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> monitor
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i couldn't scroll down, hence i didnt see it
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> why the fuck do u even need to scroll xD
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the page is pretty small xD
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i got small screen
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 1366x768
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xd
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> laptop is from 2014
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> potato
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> not really
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i7 still running fine 😉
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> potato²
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i need to change thermal paste though, it's starting to get quite hot again with this weather
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 😄
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> kaby lake gen exists since 2014? :thonk:
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> probs ivy bridge
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but his laptop supports vulkan, thats quite nice xd
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> i7 was first introduced in 2008
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> god I feel old now
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how old r u
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> leak
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I turn 26 this year
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ez
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> soonTM
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then i feel even older xd
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> 👀 leak
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am 26 already xd
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> my first ever bought PC was an intel core duo
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> xD
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 👴
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> my first ever bought PC from money that wasnt from my parents was i7 ivy bridge xd
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> so yeah old af xD
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and then comes my dad with his stories about first commodore 64 and how they bought it, bcs it was the first cool computer xd
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> tell your dad we now have rgb
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> - everywhere -
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> - everywhere -, that's the new cool
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> it's because I misused std::vector, I reserve the size and then copy but this doesn't set the actual size of the vector
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> no joke, he buys all these LED lights and puts them fcking everywhere xD
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> he's like RGB but not limited to computers xD
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> RBG man cave? :poggers:
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I'd go in debt just to have a rbg man cave
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> we dont have that, but our living room looks sexy af
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> worst thing is that i almost made a comment on this, and after checking the reference, it seemed to be safe 😄
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> only 334° more and you will make a full turn
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> use ctrl+f to search in F1 and F2 would be fire
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> is it planned already? i got this idea for so long
