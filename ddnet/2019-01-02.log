07:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> why aren't r1 demos recording everyone instead of just the tee himself?

07:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> why aren't r1 demos recording everyone instead of just the tee himself and a certain radius?
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is the difference between r1 demos and other demos?
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Freezestyler> By using /showall while playing you should be able to see everybody in your team, also in the demo
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Freezestyler> By using /showall while playing you should be able to see everybody in your team, also in the demo (doesn’t answer your question, but just in case, so i feel helpful >.<)

10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the server doesn't send you all player infos by default to save cpu and network resources. As Freezestyler said you can opt in to get them all, then you can watch everyone in the demo
14:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> is 0.6.5 actually broken or not compatible with the spoofing fix introduced with zcatch?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the spoofing fix of ddnet was kinda broken before I fixed it, dropping everything it didn't know
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you probably copied it from there
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> how do I fix it to work with 0.6.5 ._.
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> I copied it from eeee's extended implementation based on the one that east did
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1349
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> exactly my problem, will look into it, thx
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Hurrakana> hello guys, i had a problem and someone said i had to try that but i only have "autoexec_server.cfg" so can someone tell me where is the "autoexec"?

18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> linux?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> ~/.teeworlds/
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> or windows %appdata%/teeworlds
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it's in your ddnet folder
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> not appdata
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> since when it is in the ddnet folder
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> the client's autoexec was on %appdata%
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> oh well afterall I'm talking about the settings_ddnet.cfg, works the same afterall
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Hurrakana> its all what i have in the ddnet folder
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Hurrakana> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/530078334068195369/Sans_titre.jpg
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> just create it
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh deen means settings_ddnet.cfg I think
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Hurrakana see the url bar at the top: replace that with %appdata%/teeworlds
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> then open the settings_ddnet.cfg
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Hurrakana> well, still not working anyway
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Hurrakana> well, still crashing anyway
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Hurrakana> maybe someone have another solution? :[
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> autoexec.cfg is the file that is automatically looked for by a teeworlds server, if you did not specify any server config file yourself like e.g. explained in the teeworlds.com documentation where you start the server with -f config.cfg
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Hurrakana> but im trying to install the game for the first time on a computer and the game just crash when he load
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Hurrakana> but the new/last version make the game work somehow
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Hurrakana> so i think its ok, thank you guys!
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> config directory.bat -> delete everything, start game xD
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> just the settings files should be enough?
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sinisa3games> delete windows
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @Sinisa3games u
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sinisa3games> @Cellegen  u
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> 》:V
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jxsl13> guess you should install a hackintosh instead
