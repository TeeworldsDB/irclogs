15:01 <+c0d3d3v> Hey :D I don't know if that is an issue ... but I just get a ¨segmentation fault (core dumped)  DDNet¨  on 185.107.96.202:8304 https://pastebin.com/s7BFPaCJ  But I think that is only an issue with the game type BW 
16:04 <@heinrich5991> c0d3d3v: can you give us a backtrace?
16:04 <@heinrich5991> hi btw :)
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe because BW doesnt allow ddnet clients
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> at least old ones
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> are two-way platforms ever gonna be a thing?
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> (you can drop down and jump up thru them)
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like mario?

19:28 <+c0d3d3v> heinrich5991: I'll try  ^^ 
19:32 <+c0d3d3v> Jojo_: I also can not connect to german ddnet servers... that's weird because there are definitely players on the servers.
19:35 <+c0d3d3v> xD let me correct it :D now it works... it didn't work an hour ago
19:37 <@deen> c0d3d3v: might be related do DoS and how the firewall blocks it
