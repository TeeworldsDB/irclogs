00:00 <@deen> I was wondering if it's possible to get ipv6 on ddnet GER
00:00 < xRoThx> What did you want to ask? 
00:00 <@deen> Could you ask nfoservers?

18:33 <@EastByte> an account system is not going to happen It seems
18:33 <@EastByte> but I like the idea of player identification via crypto
18:51 <@deen> yeah, would be nice
18:51 <@deen> especially since we need crypto anyway for checking the signed updates in the future
18:51 <@EastByte> and ddnet servers could identify the players aswell
19:12 <@deen> yes, good solution, just need someone to implement it :P
19:13 <@deen> Hm, still don't have a Tournament map for this Sunday
19:24 < Maple> welf checked my map a bit
19:26 <@deen> 2 other maps half-tested as well
19:27 <@deen> =/
