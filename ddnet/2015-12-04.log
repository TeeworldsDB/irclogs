14:33 <+o_be_two> EastByte: whatsup about vps ?
15:09 <@deen> vps?
15:09 <+o_be_two> yes deen , EastByte wanted to try a VPS from my new game server at ovh so i gave him
15:11 <@deen> whaaaaat?
15:11 <@deen> that would be really really useful for ddnet
15:12 <@deen> current GER causes lots of problems for people
15:12 <@deen> and GER2 plain out sucks
15:13 <@deen> was it just for testing or what'S the plan?
15:14 <+o_be_two> idk the plan, but the VPS is available to use it, so i'll be happy if you keep it, no problem for me
15:15 <+o_be_two> btw i did a script to check ddos in live so we are able to take tcpdump during ddos and analize it
15:15 <@deen> hm, i try not to get involved with ddnet, but sad to see a (probably good) vps not being used when we have trouble finding good hosters for years =/
15:15 <+o_be_two> i have to work on results now, just need time ^^
15:16 <+o_be_two> deen: you know since we know together i help DDNet when i'm able too, so dont hesitate to ask me anything i'll do what i can do to help, sure
15:18 <+o_be_two> ive a lot of tcpdump now, and ddosers found a good way to make the server laggy without ddos, like by spoof ...
15:26 < TwItCh_> Hi laxa
15:26 < laxadedi> hi TwItCh_ 
15:27 < TwItCh_> Oh wait your not moderator on ddnet servers right?
15:27 < laxadedi> No
15:27 < TwItCh_> Can anyone detect what client someone is using on zcatch ddnet server?
15:27 < laxadedi> no
15:27 < TwItCh_> This guy keeps using bot...
15:28 < laxadedi> Rule of thumb: never trust client
15:28 < TwItCh_> And no one notices he using n-client
15:28 < laxadedi> Nearly everything can be faked
15:28 < TwItCh_> exactly
15:28 < laxadedi> So what's the problem ?
15:28 < TwItCh_> but he says he using ddnet, so I know admins can check if he really is, and if his not his lying
15:28 < laxadedi> Not sure ddnet even has moderators to kick cheater on Zcatch
15:28 < TwItCh_> they do
15:28 < laxadedi> ok
15:28 < laxadedi> but still
15:29 < TwItCh_> lordtheuns, goo, super, prodical
15:29 < laxadedi> he can make server think he is using ddnet client
15:29 < laxadedi> and introduce his own aimbot in the code
15:29 < laxadedi> so not realiable
15:29 < TwItCh_> he not that clever
15:29 < TwItCh_> haha talk to him on teamspeak
15:29 < laxadedi> those guys are never here
15:29 < TwItCh_> ...
15:29 < laxadedi> IRC is not a good place to call a moderator
15:29 < laxadedi> use the forum
15:29 < TwItCh_> Forum will be too late
15:29 < TwItCh_> You need instant reply
15:30 < laxadedi> IRC is more for deveploments or help about it
15:30 < TwItCh_> He already stopped playing
15:30 < laxadedi> This is teeworlds
15:30 <@deen> TwItCh_: just tell him to show the +showhookcoll
15:30 <@deen> TwItCh_: most bot clients don't have that :P
15:30 < TwItCh_> oh haha thats clever :#
15:30 < TwItCh_> :33
15:30 <@deen> not my idea, ictf players use that^^
15:31 < TwItCh_> oh I see xD Is it a 0 or 1 value
15:31 <@deen> it's very easy to get around it of course, but most use really old bot clients and can't modify them
15:31 < TwItCh_> yeah haha expecially this guy
15:31 <@deen> 0 or 1?
15:32 <@deen> it's the red laser line people use on ddnet all the time
15:32 < TwItCh_> to turn on or off
15:32 < TwItCh_> yeah
15:32 <@deen> no, you have to hold the key pressed
15:32 < TwItCh_> oh ok 
15:32 < TwItCh_> thanks :D
15:33 < TwItCh_> Are you on holiday now deen>
15:33 <@deen> anyway, zcatch in south africa sounds different. i get banned all the time on GER zcatch even though i don't have bot^^
15:33 <@deen> my euro trip is over already, if that's what you mean
15:34 < TwItCh_> euro trip? 
15:34 < TwItCh_> You can just force the vote to fail?
15:35 <@deen> i thought that's what you meant by holiday: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2085
15:38 <@deen> Wow, just got an email offering to pay me to write a "sponsored blog post"
15:39 < TwItCh_> Wow nice congrats on graduating :D 
15:39 <@deen> that stuff should not be legal, hm
15:39 <@deen> thanks
15:39 < TwItCh_> haha lol I guess you don't like writing blog posts?
15:39 < TwItCh_> why should it be illegal?
15:40 <@deen> sure i like writing blog posts
15:40 <@deen> but paying people to write something positive is not right
15:40 < TwItCh_> Do you have two degrees behind your name?
15:40 <@deen> degrees behind my name?
15:40 < TwItCh_> oh haha I see what you mean
15:40 < TwItCh_> Or masters
15:40 < TwItCh_> in CS
15:41 <@deen> no idea^^
15:41 < TwItCh_> You got masters degree in Computer Science
15:42 <@deen> I guess, but that reminds me that reminds me that my university did not send me a certificate yet. i hope i actually graduated^^
15:42 < TwItCh_> Oh haha Our marks came out yesterday xD Did much beter than I expected
15:43 < TwItCh_> You would of got a message saying to rewrite or you failed by now xD So Im sure you gratuated
15:54 < laxadedi> deen: welcome to real life
15:54 < laxadedi> everything turns around money
15:54 < laxadedi> that's a bit sad
15:54 < laxadedi> I have a teacher who came and said to all of us : "You are all here to earn more money"
15:55 < laxadedi> Hopefully, not everyone is like that
18:25 < Nimda> Memories by FÅˆokurka oo7 just released on Brutal at 2015-12-04 18:20
20:19 < laxa> Anyone knows how you compile ddnet with 64 arch on windows amd64 ?
20:19 <@deen> yes
20:20 < laxa> http://pastebin.com/N0kWKft0
20:20 <@deen> use a 64bit compiler
20:20 < laxa> I have this
20:21 < laxa> I know I have to call vcvarsall with amd64 as argument somehow for the session
20:21 < laxa> the compiler for VS is supposed to be cl.exe
20:21 < laxa> Well, how is the build bot doing it ? :)
20:21 <@deen> Hm, I just use the correct g++ for 64bit: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/ddnet-release.sh#L131
20:22 <@deen> x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
20:22 < laxa> yeah, you are not using VS compiler
20:22 <@deen> could you use CFLAGS?
20:23 <@deen> (and LDFLAGS probably)
20:23 <@deen> at least that works with g++: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/ddnet-release.sh#L115
20:24 < laxa> I have no idea
20:24 < laxa> I think I gotta do it some other way with VS
20:24 <@deen> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2548138/how-to-compile-x64-code-with-visual-studio-in-command-line
20:25 <@deen> that tells me "just use the 64bit cl.exe"
20:25 < laxa> well
20:25 < laxa> I came to that page already
20:26 < laxa> thing is, my bat script is interfacing the VS compiler for bam
20:27 < laxa> just tried one thing
20:27 < laxa> how to check if my tw is build for amd64 now ? :D
20:30 <@deen> I guess you don't have "file" on windows?^^
20:30 <@deen> right click -> properties?
20:30 < laxa> Already checked :)
20:32 < laxa> it's x86 :(
20:36 <@deen> Chilean hoster is down again because of our DDoS attacks...
20:36 < laxa> humm
20:37 < laxa> I succesfully called the 64 bits compiler
20:37 <@deen> i think south america will end up like iran now
20:37 < laxa> but bam wasn't excepting 64 bits compilation :)
20:37 <@deen> ddos attacks until we can't host any servers there anymore
20:37 <@deen> laxadedi: remove the config.lua maybe
20:38 <@deen> and a "bam clean"
20:38 < laxa> hum
20:40 < laxa> ok
20:40 < laxa> I got server x64 for sure
20:40 < laxa> now client is trouble cause linking with 32 bits library
20:42 <@deen> platform should be win64, not win32 in the bam lua scripts
20:42 <@deen> you could set TARGET_PLATFORM=win64 if the auto-detection is wrong
20:43 < laxa> that's what I was thinking of doing
20:43 <@deen> TARGET_FAMILY=windows TARGET_PLATFORM=win64 TARGET_ARCH=amd64 bam release
20:43 <@deen> but dunno, that's a hack i made for the build script, there should be a nicer way
20:44 < laxa> the nice way is to rework those files
20:44 < laxa> win64 isn't configured properly :)
20:44 < laxa> only ddnet has hacks to be compiled for amd64 windows deen
20:44 <@deen> huh?
20:45 < laxa> teeworlds doesn't distribute x64 binary windows
20:45 < laxa> only 32 bits
20:45 < laxa> that's why I am asking here
20:45 < laxa> :)
20:45 <@deen> they had win64 in 1 version at least
20:45 < laxa> I can PR a VS2015 bat script later for 64 bits if you want
20:49 < laxa> that shit is boring
20:49 < laxa> still trying to link with 32 bits library
20:50 <@deen> maybe your env is not properly set
20:51 < laxa> I am going to check that
20:51 < laxa> failure is on libxxx.lua I think
20:58 < Learath2> EastByte: do you know if letsencrypt gives out wildcards ?
20:58 <@heinrich5991> they don't
20:58 <@deen> Learath2: it does not, unfortunately
20:58 <@heinrich5991> but you could just generate a certificate for every domain you have
20:59 <@heinrich5991> (or perhaps even on-the-fly :P)
20:59 < Learath2> can i state that i hate the ssl monopoly
20:59 <@heinrich5991> it's not really a monopoly though
20:59 < Learath2> well mostly mono
20:59 <@heinrich5991> (yea, I'm currently trying very hard not to do my homework, if you ask..)
21:00 <@heinrich5991> it's so much not-monopoly that mozilla can do something like letsencrypt :)
21:00 <@deen> that reminds me, i updated nginx on ddnet yesterday, so we should have http2 with https now
21:01 < Learath2> i have an SAT tomorrow I want to study but i dont have anything to study as its so easy so instead i mess around with nginx
21:01 < laxa> deen: nice lol
21:02 <@deen> (i still don't like that http2 doesn't work without tls)
21:02 < Learath2> what would be the point to not handing out wildcards given you own the domain
21:02 < laxa> I guess chrome doesn't try http2 yet
21:02 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: wildcard are discouraged I think
21:02 <@deen> laxa: chrome and firefox use http2
21:02 < laxa> Well
21:03 < laxa> I just came on ddnet and it was Http 1.1
21:03 <@deen> laxa: only https
21:03 < laxa> welll
21:03 <@deen> oh, funny. just checked and my chrome on linux uses http 1.1 as well^^
21:04 <@deen> but firefox http 2.0
21:04 < laxa> developpers tools are not ready for HTTP2.0 yet
21:04 < laxa> can't use "copy request/response header" for http 2 ?
21:08 <@deen> i guess nginx is somewhow configured wrongly
21:08 <@deen> on other servers it seems to work with h2 on chrome
21:13 < laxa> Giving up for now, seems like linking libraries is too much of a hassle for me
21:15 <@deen> laxa: i think the problem is setting the environment variables
21:15 <@deen> if you can't get thet working, you can hardcode at the top of bam.lua to see if that's it
21:16 < laxa> dunno what is the final call from bam.lua : os.getenv("PLATFORM_FAMILY")
21:16 < laxa> already tried to hardcore value in bam.lua
21:16 <@heinrich5991> probably returns "windows"
21:16 <@deen> that gets the PLATFORM_FAMILY environment variable
21:16 < laxa> they are all NULL
21:16 <@deen> then set them!
21:16 < laxa> well
21:16 < laxa> ok
21:17 < laxa> gonna try that then
21:18 < laxa> are the compilation warnings normal ?
21:18 <@deen> probably not
21:18 < laxa> 10 compilations warnings about double being treated as flor or smt
21:18 < laxa> *float
21:18 <@deen> oh well, i never compiled with visual studio, so i couldn't fix those warnings!
21:18 <@deen> feel free to fix the source code^^
21:19 < laxa> That's what I thought :p
21:19 < laxa> I don't have the CI on my fork right ?
21:19 <@deen> CI?
21:19 < laxa> to be sure I don't break other builds
21:19 < laxa> Continuous Integration
21:19 <@deen> if you sign up for the CI site, you have it
21:19 <@deen> but it only tests compilation on linux
21:22 < laxa> wow
21:22 < laxa> seems to work from bam points right now
21:23 < laxa> compilation in progress
21:23 < laxa> build failed
21:24 < laxa> can't find python roflmao
21:25 <@deen> i'll set that the forum only runs on https, since passwords are entered
21:26 <@deen> or should we run all on https only?
21:26 < laxa> forum at least
21:26 < laxa> Well, from my personnal opinion, I would say everything
21:27 <@deen> but from what i tested https with h2 is still slower than unencrypted http1.1
21:27 < laxa> Well, that's sounds normal to me I guess
21:28 <@deen> I guess the idea of forcing people to use h2 with https only was to have https more performant than http
21:29 < laxa> I guess you are suppose to have more performance when having much more elements in the page
21:29 < laxa> *improved performance
21:32 < laxa> well
21:32 < laxa> can't compile x64 that easily
21:32 < laxa> some more tweaks are needed
