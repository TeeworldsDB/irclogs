00:21 <@deen> here we go, should be working
00:29 < Nimda> New server detected : DDNet CAN!
00:30 < laxa> wtf
00:30 <@deen> hm?
00:30 < laxa> canada really ? :p
00:30 <@deen> really
00:30 <@deen> 2 minutes after creating the server Fudgyking and Zgokee made a record on SimplePlay 2 on it^^
00:31 <@deen> i guess it will be more popular than China
00:31 < laxa> Who is paying for it ?
00:31 <@deen> o_be_one: 
00:32 < laxa> ok
00:38 <@deen> I made a list of server sponsors here: http://ddnet.tw/staff/
00:40 < laxa> Nice <3
00:45 <@deen> Coders as well while I'm at it
00:47 < laxa> you forgot EastByte inside coders deen :p
00:48 <@deen> oh
00:48 <@deen> i forgot some more!
00:49 <@deen> thanks, fixed
01:46 < xrothx> deen:  You should make a worldmap with the countries colored where we have a host
01:47 < xrothx> Will be easyer to check where we could expand
01:47 <@deen> like the one at the bottom at http://ddnet.tw ?
01:47 <@deen> i should add the 2 most recent locations though, and remove iran =/
01:53 < xrothx> yes :)
01:53 < xrothx> didn' t saw t
01:55 <@deen> ok, updated
01:55 < xrothx> north africa, brazil, 
01:55 < xrothx> south europe
01:56 < xrothx> 3more & we cover pretty much all of them
01:56 <@deen> the only really needed one is iran
01:56 <@deen> big community there
01:57 < xrothx> will check
01:57 <@deen> it's a bit of a messy situation
01:57 <@deen> if you just buy a server there we will get ddosed 100%
01:59 < xrothx> I don't just buy a server
02:00 < xrothx> I will search & ask your opinion :P
02:00 <@deen> There's KinG, erfanzone and the Persian Pro guys already
02:02 < xrothx> where do they get their hosting?
02:02 <@deen> I don't know
02:02 <@deen> KinG is having trouble getting any at all, don't know about the others
02:09 < xrothx> Cant find :o
02:12 <@deen> can't find what?
02:15 < xrothx> any server in iran
02:15 < xrothx> only with like 20GB monthly traffic :o
02:15 <@deen> yes, traffic is horribly expensive
02:15 <@deen> same problem in chile
02:16 <@deen> i pay extra for the traffic there
02:16 <@deen> and most websites are only in farsi of course
02:17 < xrothx> hm..
02:17 < xrothx> could you find out where persian clan takes their hosting,
02:18 < xrothx> *?
02:18 <@deen> and when i found a server i bought it and it was terribly oversold
02:18 <@deen> king once told me, but i forgot
02:18 <@deen> ah
02:19 <@deen> according to the whois entry it's parspack.com, i think they were the only hoster in iran i had good experiences with
02:19 <@deen> but they threw us out because we had too many ddos attacks
02:20 < xrothx> ok
02:21 <@deen> http://parspack.com/cloud-hosting
02:21 <@deen> configurator here if you're interested about the price
02:22 <@deen> it was pretty expensive as well, like half of the regular iranian income
02:22 < xrothx> http://www.meinfoway.com/linux-vps.php 
02:23 <@deen> oh yeah, and the next problem: paypal and so are not allowed to do business with iranians
02:23 < xrothx> lmao
02:23 < xrothx> credit card :)
02:24 <@deen> i mean "paypal and all other american companies"
02:24 <@deen> visa and mastercard are problematic too i guess
02:24 < xrothx> Oh? ok
02:25 <@deen> Paypal to Russia also doesn't work for me anymore =/
02:26 < xrothx> hm.. 
02:26 <@deen> what's with the middle east infoway?
02:26 <@deen> you have to be a bit cautious
02:26 < xrothx> No iran datacentre with a good protection and a normal price?
02:26 <@deen> even most servers you get in iran are located in Europe
02:27 <@deen> the internet has not been seen very positive by the iranian government
02:27 < xrothx> I search for middle east servers since Iran wasn't succesful
02:27 <@deen> they run their own internal network, for which you generally get unlimited traffic, but no connectivity to the internet
02:28 < xrothx> :o
02:28 < xrothx> really? They have a whole private network? Nice! :)
02:28 < xrothx> But any country near to iran with what we need? 
02:30 <@deen> i don't think there's any way to get a good connection for iranian players from another country
02:30 <@deen> on the parspack server they had nice 20 ping
02:31 <@deen> also, iran is the most developed country in that region
02:31 < xrothx> What is the price of the parspack server we need?
02:31 <@deen> i don't remember
02:31 < xrothx> ok
02:32 <@deen> and as i said, if you just buy a ddnet persian server there, we will get ddosed and go down
02:32 < xrothx> but not ddos protected right? So not worth a penny for us
02:32 <@deen> you won't get any ddos protected server i think
02:32 <@deen> even the hosters themselves, like parspack, host their main servers in Germany instead
02:33 < xrothx> Okay.. So not worth a try? :)
02:34 <@deen> the best way would be a cooperation, but they all use Windows and have conditions i don't agree to
02:36 < xrothx> unless you find out where they are hosted
02:37 < xrothx> what do they want? I guess admin? ^^
02:37 <@deen> they are hosted at parspack
02:37 <@deen> they want their own name instead of ddnet
02:37 <@deen> windows servers
02:37 <@deen> admin
02:38 <@deen>  /r and some other cheats
02:38 < xrothx> Well, can't agree to that
02:38 <@deen> maybe I'm misunderstanding, but parspack doesn't look all that expensive
02:38 < xrothx> parspack isn't protected right? Howso do they not get ddosed by eachother then? 
02:39 <@deen> they do
02:39 <@deen> it would be about 370,000 rial, which currently makes 11 €
02:39 < xrothx> then we should try to config our firewall better? 
02:39 <@deen> firewall doesn't do any good when the network is overloaded
02:40 < xrothx> notting possible to have a better uptime? 
02:40 < xrothx> maybe buyy 3 small servers as EastByte  suggested 
02:41 < xrothx> he said it was better to have 3 small ones 
02:41 <@deen> not practical with the way ddnet works
02:41 < xrothx> And maybe when his teeworlds cloud program is done? Would be nice 
02:41 <@deen> harder to setup
02:41 < xrothx> okay..
02:42 < xrothx> but it is possible? 
02:42 <@deen> would need a lot of work to make it work well
02:42 < xrothx> But once its done, we are good right? So why not putting 1time big effort in it? 
02:44 <@deen> i don't know how it would work and i don't think it would work well eventually
02:50 < xrothx> http://cloudc.me/en this? 
02:51 < xrothx> It came when I searched UAE ddos protected servers
02:53 <@deen> datacenter in zurich?
02:54 <@deen> and take a look at their prices
02:54 <@deen> 55 € / month for a 1 core, 512 MB RAM vps
02:54 < xrothx> got it! http://www.superbithost.com/offshore-dedicated-united-arab-emires.php
02:55 <@deen> the server i had at datafabrik for 10 € / month would cost 170 € / month there, nice
02:55 < xrothx> :p
02:57 <@deen> i can't imagine that you get a good ping from Tehran to UAE
02:59 < xrothx> fuck it
02:59 < xrothx> Got enough google for today )
03:00 < xrothx> Let me know if you have any idea where they host what we could use :)
03:00 <@deen> i don't expect to find anything
03:02 < xrothx> http://cloudc.me/en/cart/add/105
03:02 < xrothx> swiss
03:03 < xrothx> 3am here. I will go now
03:03 < xrothx> Bye 
03:05 <@deen> price goes up from 10 CHF to 210 CHF if you want ddos protection^^
03:05 <@deen> bye
09:03 < xrothx> deen:  Was there a downtime? I see royal server has been restarted 5h ago? 
10:56 <@deen> interesting, the ingame ping is now exactly 8 higher than the ICMP ping for me, on all ddnet servers
10:57 <@deen> (in scoreboard)
11:09 < meow_> continuously? 
11:20 <@deen> yes
11:20 <@deen> i think it's because the client doesn't immediately ack the packet, it waits for the new predtick to arrive
14:51 < Maple> yo
14:57 < meow_> Hi
14:57 < o_be_one> yo
14:58 < o_be_one> good job deen ,ive read the news and ill try maybe this night ^^ thank you :)
14:59 < o_be_one> deen, but icmp is in TCP and game is in UDP no ? Maybe ddos protect act differently with the protocol used
15:00 < o_be_one> oh about the ping, with French OVH i have 100ms from Canada, and on nfoservers i have 130ms ... Just to let you know.
15:01 < o_be_one> and about ddrace servers the other problem is that some players vote maps when you are at 2min from the end or when you are trying to reach the end ... Sometime it happends and we are like 4 or 5 to reaching the end line and hope, changing map ... WTF ?! it's a serious problem
15:02 < meow_> totally agree with the fact o_be_one has spoken to, yesterday i played a solo map which was hard for me, i played about 25minutes by myself, random guys joined and voted other map, instantly change... i was very upset
15:08 < o_be_one> yes and when it happened, the map change like in 5s, like if it was an admin typing "yes" in rcon
15:08 < o_be_one> it's a real problem ...
15:15 < Nimda> DDNet EUR went down!
15:15 < Nimda> DDNet CAN went down!
15:15 < Nimda> DDNet EUR went back online!
15:15 < Nimda> DDNet CAN went back online!
15:16 < meow_> maybe a suggestion could be to check whether the guys time who pressed F3 is greater than of those who press F4 or something like that?
15:16 < meow_> real time -> active played, not afk
15:19 < o_be_one> can down ? wtf oO
16:02 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
16:03 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
16:09 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
16:10 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
16:29 < o_be_one> lol CAD ddnet servers are very very very light :D
16:30 < o_be_one> 9 servers witch use only 200mb ram and 2% vCore x)
16:38 <@EastByte> maybe we should require a consent vote on solo servers
16:38 <@EastByte> ah and I have another idea
16:38 <@EastByte> instead of executing the vote directly on pass
16:39 <@EastByte> we could make a ~10 seconds countdown in broadcast
16:39 <@EastByte> so people now the map is going to change
16:39 <@EastByte> so they can safe
16:39 <@EastByte> save*
16:41 < o_be_one> how to save please ? /save ?
16:44 <@EastByte> when you are in a team you can save doing "/save <secret>"
16:44 <@EastByte> then you'll be kicked out of race and later can continue racing using "/load secret"
16:46 <@EastByte> deen: what do you think, if a server has people racing (passed the startline), on map change the server starts a countdown before switching the map
16:57 < o_be_one> LOL i have onyl 15 to 20ms ping on DDNet CAN TW ... x)
16:58 < o_be_one> i hope that Maple will had same ping :D
16:58 < o_be_one> ty EastByte thats good to know :). Only in team ?
16:58 <@EastByte> yea
16:58 <@EastByte> in team 0 it would be silly
16:58 < o_be_one> sure
16:58 <@EastByte> also you will lose one minute if you do /save /load
16:59 < o_be_one> to load you need to go to team before ?
16:59 < o_be_one> like if i was team 7
16:59 < o_be_one> i need to team 7 and load secret ?
16:59 <@EastByte> doesn't matter which team you go
16:59 < o_be_one> ok
16:59 <@EastByte> it just have to be the same players
16:59 < o_be_one> ok nice
17:00 < o_be_one> about the vote problem, maybe mappers can add a checkpoint when we are next to the endline so its not possible to stop the map
17:00 < o_be_one> like the kill protection
17:00 <@EastByte> it's hard to make new mapping standards
17:00 < o_be_one> yeah i know
17:00 < o_be_one> just seen one map with sound feature 
17:00 < o_be_one> its was a tv x)
17:00 <@EastByte> haha
17:01 <@EastByte> *shshhshhhhhhrhhhr*
17:03 < Maple> i have 20ish ping 
17:03 < o_be_one> awesome :D !
17:03 < Maple> mhm
17:03 < o_be_one> go grow the can community :p
17:04 < Maple> we had 5 players last night!
17:04 <@EastByte> wow :)
17:09 < o_be_one> not bad ^^
17:18 < o_be_one> is there a list of moderators on ddnet ?
17:18 < o_be_one> moderators and admins
17:19 < o_be_one> found the list
17:22 < o_be_one> deen, what if we suggest a new ddnet.tw design ? like an upgrade
17:22 <@EastByte> not needed
17:24 < o_be_one> i think cause of the ddnet community is growing
17:25 < o_be_one> maybe offering a better design could be good cause ddnet.tw website is now a big part of this community
17:25 < o_be_one> showing ranks and other helpful things
17:25 < o_be_one> and cause its now a main part of the game, it needs to be as good as maps
17:26 < o_be_one> how someone can be moderator of ddnet ?
17:29 < o_be_one> ddnet has some city servers oO ?
17:30 <@EastByte> it has?
17:30 < o_be_one> laxa, t'es d'où en France ?
17:31 < o_be_one> EastByte, the title of this thread : http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=629
17:32 <@EastByte> hm dunno
17:45 < o_be_one> just registered too ddnet forum :D
18:00 < o_be_one> deen, where did you get your vimrc ?
18:25 < laxa> deen: I have idea to improve ddnet client
18:26 < laxa> maybe some way to see whatever message where your nick is inside if you come back from afk
18:26 < laxa> one possible idea would be : colored text in F1 for highlighted messages
18:27 < laxa> I don't know if that's possible :)
18:27 <@EastByte> f1 is a dev console
18:27 <@EastByte> we won't use colors in there xd
18:27 < laxa> yeah, but if you go afk 10 minutes and press "show chat" you won't see all messages
18:27 <@EastByte> yea, but there are other solutions instead of using the console
18:27 < laxa> dev console should be friendly, I don't see why not
18:27 < laxa> well, I am offering one possibility, you can find another one :p
18:48 <@deen> EastByte: I think the "countdown before map change" would annoy too many people
18:48 < laxa> o_be_one: Colombes, 10 km de Paris
18:49 <@deen> o_be_one: i'm not a designer obviously, ddnet.tw website design is the best i can do. if anyone can improve it, go ahead
18:49 < laxa> design is simple and fine to me
18:49 <@deen> no, there are no ddnet city servers
18:50 < laxa> countdown before map change could be nice, so people can save if they are in team
18:50 <@deen> o_be_one: my vimrc is probably from when i started using linux, no idea how i put it together, haven't changed anything since then
18:52 <@deen> laxa: yeah, some chat highlight for old messages would be nice, but i don't know. Maybe people should just not use Teeworlds as a real chat client^^
18:52 < laxa> deen: I think changing text into console would be nice, but EastByte thinks the opposite
18:52 <@deen> i wouldn't want the console colored either
18:53 < laxa> Hum ok then
18:58 < laxa> the other solution
18:59 < laxa> would probably to make a popup message of highlighted messages if you are afk then
18:59 < o_be_one> deen, about webdesign thats what i mean : someone can help enhance it yes :)
19:00 <@deen> laxa: ewww
19:00 < o_be_one> why not a chat tab ?
19:00 <@deen> as i said, i don't want ddnet client to be a chat client, it's mainly about playing, not chatting
19:02 <@EastByte> why would a countdown be annoying? let's say there are about 40 players and a vote just started which might be passed the next 5 seconds
19:02 <@EastByte> no one knows whether it'll pass or how long it takes
19:03 <@EastByte> it's just like a surprise
19:03 <@EastByte> the map change is like a not revokable forced event
19:04 <@EastByte> should be more friendly
19:04 < o_be_one> EastByte, but you need to know thats its moderators/admins who force vote when it happened
19:04 < o_be_one> most of time i mean
19:04 <@EastByte> yea but doesn't matter
19:04 < o_be_one> how many time ive seen a vote iand 1s after hop changin map ... wtf -_-
19:04 <@EastByte> if the vote passes I have about 10 seconds time to save my team
19:05 < o_be_one> yeah your true its useful
19:07 <@deen> EastByte: most players are in team 0 anyway, so they can't do anything. also, often the players voting are currently racing, so they would only get annoyed by the countdown
19:08 < o_be_one> what is the bandwith used /month by a tw server ?
19:08 <@deen> that depends on the number of players
19:08 < o_be_one> the max you used
19:08 <@deen> and how often map is changed etc
19:08 <@EastByte> but it's always like this: 1 or 2 people decide to vote, most of the players press f3/f4 randomly
19:08 <@EastByte> only the voters will be annoyed by this
19:08 <@deen> Chile has around 600 GB every month
19:09 < o_be_one> oh good to know ty :)
19:09 <@deen> i don't monitor the others closely and ddos attacks are bad for statistics anyway
19:09 <@deen> EastByte: and what about no one playing in team anyway?^^
19:09 <@deen> maybe 20-30% are in team
19:10 <@EastByte> well the countdown can be triggered in case there are teams racing
19:10 <@EastByte> interesting news: http://www.heise.de/open/meldung/Microsoft-NET-wird-komplett-Open-Source-2452033.html
19:10 <@EastByte> .net is going to be opensource
19:12 <@EastByte> well nvm
19:12 <@EastByte> in case the number of ddnet players will raise, it'll be usefull to use one server per map
19:12 <@deen> hm?
19:12 <@EastByte> disabling mapvotes
19:13 <@deen> i doubt it
19:13 <@EastByte> guess there are 2000 players online
19:13 <@deen> but many would want to play the same map
19:13 <@EastByte> sure
19:14 <@deen> and you really want to run 700 servers in each location?
19:14 <@EastByte> they'll just join the server with their favourite map
19:14 <@deen> I mean, with 2000 players there would be 5 full Kobra 3 servers
19:14 <@EastByte> it can be done dynamically :P
19:14 <@deen> you always with your complicated solutions!
19:14 <@EastByte> yea I like complicated stuff!!
19:15 <@deen> i don't, because then i have to fix bugs for months :P
19:15 <@EastByte> but the map votesystem is silly on full servers
19:16 <@EastByte> there always are like ~50% who want another map and who want to stay
19:16 <@deen> I haven't seen a map change on full servers in the last months
19:17 <@deen> especially since i increased the number of votes needed
19:17 <@EastByte> how much?
19:18 <@deen> 12 i think
19:18 <@EastByte> hm
19:18 <@deen> i understand that it's a problem on nearly empty servers
19:19 <@deen> but do map changes actually happen with more than 20 players?
19:19 <@EastByte> if there only are 12 votes needed?
19:19 <@EastByte> why not
19:19 <@deen> also, ddnet will obviously not grow to have 2000 players :P
19:19 <@deen> because people vote f4
19:19 <@EastByte> yea I do to protect players who want to play this map
19:19 <@deen> i can't even recall the last time i saw it happening
19:54 < Nimda> Website went down!
19:54 <@deen> Nimda is drunk?
19:54 < laxa> xD
19:55 < laxa> failed to get json
19:55 < laxa> or json empty
19:55 < Nimda> Website went back online!
20:12 < o_be_one> hey deen the can server is with fast emote
20:12 <@deen> oh yeah, i copied the config from usa
20:12 <@deen> broken wanted that. should i disable?
20:12 < o_be_one> are you crazy ? i love fast emote !
20:12 <@deen> all blockers do
20:14 < o_be_one> its better to express how happy you feel
20:16 < Maple> yea spam emote rocks
20:18 < o_be_one> i love Maple <3 definitely :D
20:18 < o_be_one> ddrace can love it, they just dont know this feature ;)
20:32 < o_be_one> oh deen ive seen you have edited my nickname on the news, thank you :)
20:52 < laxa> spam emote is bad, like any spam...
21:27 < o_be_one> it annoys nobody
21:27 < o_be_one> not like spam
21:29 < laxa> it annoys me
21:29 < laxa> please, not this shit on ddrace at least
21:34 <@heinrich5991> deen: I guess you shouldn't drop the delay too low, allows generating much traffic (e.g. make a delay of 0.02s)
21:35 <@deen> heinrich5991: i don't know if there is a limit right now
21:35 <@deen> sv_emoticon_delay 0 is only set on USA and CAN servers
21:41 < o_be_one> i have unmetered bandwith so i dont care about that, on 2x1.5gbps to internet :p
21:44 <@heinrich5991> o_be_one: you increase the attack surface with stuff like this
21:45 <@deen> yeah, heinrich5991 is right, there should definitely be a limit, even if it's smaller than what humans can reach
21:46 <@deen> Maybe sv_emoticon_delay should be measured in ticks instead of seconds
21:46 <@deen> then we could set something lower than 1 second
21:46 < laxa> please no :(
21:46 <@deen> laxa: not for european servers, just for USA and CAN
21:46 < laxa> oh right
21:47 <@deen> i want 1 second to say everywhere else
21:47 <@deen> stay*
21:54 <@deen> that leads us to another problem though. sometimes config values are minutes, sometimes seconds, and now i want to introducte ticks as well =/
21:54 <@deen> so many units
22:17 < eeeee> i think there already are ticks somewhere
22:18 < eeeee> sv_chat_penalty

22:45 < o_be_one> xxlddrace is in tick now if i remember well
22:46 < o_be_one> 1s is good, but on EUR serv i think its more that 1s.
22:54 <@deen> or maybe 3s, whatever is default
23:00 < Learath2> floating points in configuration
23:01 < Learath2> might be a pain to deal with but not sure :D
23:01 < Learath2> then could make seconds a standart
23:01 <@deen> i think the performance improvements went well
23:05 <@deen> does anyone know something about the "blockZ ~ ddnet" mod?
23:05 <@deen> I'd like to run it in chile, but can't find the source
23:06 < laxa> nope
23:07 <@deen> ok, found the irc
23:08 <@deen> the mod is really popular
23:08 <@deen> often one of the fullest servers in TW
23:08 <@deen> based on ddnet =)
23:37 < o_be_one> ill try it
23:37 < o_be_one> but i think you need to let popular servers alone
23:37 < o_be_one> cause for the owner its like stealing his community
23:38 <@deen> meh, i can't imagine many chileans playing that with ping 300 in germany
23:39 < o_be_one> lol sure
23:39 < o_be_one> if its in other country sure its a good idea
23:39 < o_be_one> but see when you have hosted blmapV3ROYAL, i've lost all my ROYAL players
23:39 < o_be_one> i think it's not a great way to do that
23:40 < o_be_one> if the owner is a bastard, its a little different, but for friendly owners, i think its unfair
23:41 <@deen> what?
23:41 <@deen> we hosted blmapV3ROYAL for many months without any complaints (or any players^^)
23:41 <@deen> i didn't change anything and suddenly players appeared
23:41 <@deen> and i hosted the map on request
23:41 < o_be_one> sure i was with a better ddos protection :p
23:42 < o_be_one> but i was here before you :p
23:42 <@deen> so we shouldn't run block servers in europe or what?
23:42 < o_be_one> lol today ive tryed "blmapv2" on candys server ...
23:42 < o_be_one> players made me laugh : hey o_tee i like your new server !"
23:43 < o_be_one> what ? its not mine lol :D
23:43 < o_be_one> players knows me for actual blocker servers ...
23:43 < o_be_one> maybe i need to make a tw community now
23:43 < o_be_one> a tw blocker community
23:44 < o_be_one> deen, royal is one of the most played map, i was with approx 50 players every days ... And suddenly, testee apeared with his server with same map ... When vali has started hard ddos
23:45 < o_be_one> i was the only one most played cause of server quality ...
23:45 < o_be_one> no keep it, it's done now ...
23:45 <@deen> i don't understand what i've done wrong
23:45 < o_be_one> i smile when i seen like 10 to 20 players on my royal server lol ... 
23:45 < o_be_one> dont worry its not directly you
23:46 <@deen> I've been running the same server for months and when players appear i should shut it down?
23:46 < o_be_one> you told me that you hate blocker and after you started to host it ...
23:46 < o_be_one> i didnt understand that.
23:46 <@deen> people asked me to host it, so i did
23:46 <@deen> i also don't like oldschool maps, solo maps, brutal maps and we still host them all
23:46 < o_be_one> no one really host ddrace 
23:47 <@deen> they did a year ago
23:47 < o_be_one> well just its like if new ddnet like community appears, and make something powerful and started to host same map than you.
23:47 < o_be_one> and you, you see your players goins to this new community
23:48 < o_be_one> well i need to go :)
23:49 <@deen> i could shut down the block servers
23:49 <@deen> but i think xrothx wouldn't like that
23:49 <@deen> would probably need to buy my own server for GER
23:49 < o_be_one>  sure he will dont like that, and no dont down them
23:49 < o_be_one> deen i have no problem with you, its just a past thing i need to tell you, no more
23:50 < o_be_one> you are very generous and very benefic for tw community, before i didnt knew you so i was expecting you was not a poor guy like other owners already seen before
23:51 < o_be_one> hey, i'm a part of this community now :D
23:51 < o_be_one> dont worry it's ok :)
23:51 < o_be_one> sincerely. Well i'm late now lol i need to go :p
23:51 < o_be_one> see you ^^
