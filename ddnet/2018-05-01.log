00:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lmfao
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @Learath2 KoG =/ ddnet
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> KoG maps not available on maps.ddnet.tw
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> nobo
00:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lmfao
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we host popular maps on maps.ddnet.tw even if we don't host them on ddnet genuis
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 could you top up my copy of teehistorian sometime?
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that is if you have decent upload speeds
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @ᶰ°Konͧsti i dont think these are ddnet maps either
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/440652392703459328/Screen_Shot_2018-04-30_at_6.14.59_PM.png
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> actually i think most of them got pulled from my server somehow
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think heinrichs archive has all maps from the servers that dont have passwords
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heinrich's archive is completely seperate
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> nobys screenshot is from heinrichs archive
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no its from maps.ddnet.tw/
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> this one is from the archive
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/440653296932356114/Screen_Shot_2018-04-30_at_6.18.36_PM.png
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> so pretty much the same
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> oh oops.
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think deen added most downloaded x maps or sth
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> where do they come from
01:23 <+Learath2> probably from heinrich's archive or his own downloaded maps folder, who knows
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> does a client have to join the servers to get the mapfile?
01:23 <+Learath2> yeah
01:24 <+Learath2> you just disconnect right before sending NETMSG_READY iirc and you just get the map
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> so if i open a server, i should be able to see heinrichs bot joining to get the map?   if so, whats it called?
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've never seen it actually, and he might have stopped
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> nah. i have seen a lot maps from 2018
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it only scrapes empty servers not to disturb anyone
01:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it the bot named maps.ddnet.tw?
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ive seen it join my server several times in the console when it was empty
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> could be
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> does it leave instantly? i gotta write this in my firendslist 😄
01:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> it tries to call every vote option then leaves
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> does it have the blocker maps which you can only join through that lobby thing?
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lobby thing?
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think if anyone joins while it's voting around it'll just leave
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can join them from the server list too
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> and yeah ive seen the bot join and instantly leave when there are players
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> oh. i thought it connects you to the lobby if you do try that
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> oh. i thought it connects you to the lobby if you try that
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can someoe follow me and hear if they also have double hooking sound?
07:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> The bot is called Konsti
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum no, the bot called "maps.ddnet.tw" is the one for maps.ddnet.tw
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mine is called "downloader" I think
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum the source is here: https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/downloader/src/main.rs
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> a teeworlds server cant host its on http map server?
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> and theres no way to upload their own maps to maps.ddnet.tw?
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ZombieToad you can send it to us 🙂
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> will you accept 100MB map? :D
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why is it 100MB?
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i havent made it yet
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but why does it need 100MB? ^^
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> lots of embedded memes
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> and nsfw
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> 10 yrs to download
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> :q
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> w/c
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I stole dozens of maps from heinrich index
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wanna make up for that by sending me your downloadedmaps folder? 🙂
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> if u want
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sure
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> but there are a lot of test mals also
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's ok if you're fine with them perhaps landing on the map list
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Where to send u
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> upload it to a hoster (like solidfiles.com) and send me the link
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> when u are already done in uploading maps u could also apply my Fix :O

12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> unfix it for everywhere O:
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> heinrich did u get the maps
13:18 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: guess having it two ways doesnt make much sense
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> @Ryozuki cool forum
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> but
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> https://gyazo.com/30094118d042be9fe9246f5bf0fa623d
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ᶰ°Konͧsti yea, got it
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> HMM
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm?
13:50 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: the idea would be that you can fix it in old maps in the code and if you change the map, you don't have to change the source
13:51 <+Learath2> how about a global cfg with crc, bug pairs?
13:51 <@heinrich5991> that's essentially what this is?
13:51 <+Learath2> we don't have to edit the source to fix maps and we can fix maps without changing the old maps
13:52 <@heinrich5991> but then we'd have the centralization problem that deen mentioned (?)
13:52 <@heinrich5991> i.e. you can't fix maps without updating the global config
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> the physics should be the same on every map..
13:53 <+Learath2> too late for that
13:54 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: hmm, I feel editing the source for a map fix feels meh
13:56 <+Learath2> lets just remove Binary and call it a day :P
14:02 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: backward compatibility \o/
14:02 <@heinrich5991> do you feel it? :P
14:03 <+Learath2> hmm, we enable mapbug on a map in the source, someone doesn't want to on their server, what do?
14:03 <@heinrich5991> we do it for backward-compatibility
14:04 <@heinrich5991> if they want it without the bug, change the map ever so slightly, so that the crc changes
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I like Learaths idea of fixing it by deleting Binary :troll:
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> we should apply the same idea on getspeed 2 :thonkery:
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :GWchadThonkery:
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> This is how qshar and kamillentee fix things on KoG
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> if something is bugged they just delete it
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> cuz lazy :troll:
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :danAmazing:
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :wtf:
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Its true
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> xd
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> "Its not an insult if its true :GWchadThonkery: "
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "it's not an insult if it's true" – not particularly true
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Calling a retard a retard is rude but not an insult :GWchadThonkery:
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> xD
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insult
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> literally the second sentence
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *third
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> then every truth is a insult
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> if i want it to be a insult
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> _may_ be factual
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @noby nobo
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its a fact

15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ❓
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> [8:04 AM] Im 'corneum: then every truth is a insult
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i was replying t o that
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @ᶰ°Konͧsti no u
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no u
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> truth hurts most
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> jao is a fag :feelsbadman:
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> rq
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the truth is that botters keep botting
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why banned
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> in Konsti
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> konsti banned?
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> konsti is hates
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> #join-leave
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> konsti is haters
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what a random ban. but its ok for me ;P
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why ban
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> jao got pissed because he called him a f**
15:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> that's konsti
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ban because insulting is not OK
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and I told him many times before
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> might as well ban his secondary account on here
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as long as they don't talk
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> whatever
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ban @FluffiexD too
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can you take talking permission instead?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jesus Christ> ban half of this server, its friendly family server
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's about insulting others
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're welcome to use any words if you don't direct them at others
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> even nigger faggot?
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 you also have to understand there may be friendly "insults" between friends
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> banters
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or idk how to say iot
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the insulted may come to me and get the other person unbanned if you want
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that should take care of that
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @konsti you are a fag
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Ha:feelsamazingman:
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> thing is you can ban half of the server for such light insults (including learath 😏)
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> if a admin does it, its allowed
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> He isn't insulted so I could say this
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Sorry for the bad language tho
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> botting is haram
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <worstwish> i am true muslim
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can insults go to people who arent on this server?
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> No
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unless it's a public figure or something, no
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and even then
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> no rabble-rousing then
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ?
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> volksverhetzung
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, don't do things that are illegal?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 💊
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> redpilled
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But to be serious I am more irritated by useless discussion by for example Lola then swearing from konsti.
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you mean on the forum?
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> literaly anywhere lola posts
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> ^
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> either this discord is 99% quiet or people insult/talk trash most of the time. what do u prefer
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> While it better be quite
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like the part where people don't insult. I also see that
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what is there to discuss anywhere?
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what to you get from a quiet server?
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Useless discussion about changed physics, no map releases bad map releases and everything that is about complaining to moderators/admins
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont think the trashtalk is bad.
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think insults is what gets people to come to discord ^^
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> what do you get from a quiet server?
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Trashtalk is not bad, if it is used in #off-topic  just like this. Nothing to do with development xd
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ok lets try to keep everything insulting out for a week or so and see if it’s better
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> as long as there is no other discussion going on, i think trashtalk is okay on every channel
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> and its not like u choose where to start the chat. it just develops
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> well serious discussion won’t start if something else is going on

15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> …
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Im 'corneum  well like Learath2 should read everything here to see if something important was posted. And have to filter everything out :0
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> disturbing a serious discussion counts as insult @noby 🍌
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no u
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i can count some peoples existance as an insult to humanity.
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if something is important, you should ping learath or report on github/forum
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can’t expect anyone do go through all messages anyway
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can’t expect anyone to go through all messages anyway
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually do go through most everything on #developer
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i would prefer if you would read intern channels instead 😪
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i can do it if you give me access 😛
15:42 <+Learath2> I read those aswell
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @Im 'corneum good that nobody knows who my second account is :feelsbadman:
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @Im 'corneum good that nobody knows who my second account is :feelsgoodman:
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it matter if a banned person can view the chat?
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no – it's public
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> then why ban
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you read and then ignore it 🙃
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> instead of giveng a muted role
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's a button for ban?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 🙂
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> there is also a button for creating role
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> giving muted role takes as much clicks
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, one level deeper
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you don’t need to create it, it’s already there 😮
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's easier for others to keep track of
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> #join-leave 🙂
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just don't enjoy interacting with you tbh
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> rude
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you know what is ridiculous? ^^
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :troll:
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> people complaining about people banning to quickly
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and then
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ᶰ°Konͧsti it's not fun talking with someone who hates you
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> suggesting to ban for a lot weaker things
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i suggest dont care about words
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> words cant hurt anyone
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you think I hate you?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> exactly my feelings
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> words can hurt people 🙂
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> k
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> unless ure not mentally disabled
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> unless ure  mentally disabled
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> words don't change anything, actions do
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't possibly change anything about your life with anything I say
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> except ure lawyer
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> xd
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 really? you can't motivate someone to code more?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g.
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or encourage people to do stuff?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's ultimately your choice to do it, what I say is irrelevant
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lol, i discouraged u changing physics but u didnt care
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think that's true
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can call you lazy and you can take that comment to heart and do something about it, or you don't and do nothing about it, which is the same state we were at before I said anything
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u can encourage people to panic by yelling fire in a crowded space
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :troll:
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @heinrich5991 learath insults me on here pls ban him
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> he calls me an ass
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> on noby fng u wont get banned for no matter what u say unless ure tagging @noby in einem deutschen Satz
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do not bend my words, I never called you an ass
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> `***konsti has been muted for 10 seconds`
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :feelsbadman:
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i cant remember what u called me but i remember seeing a donkey picture yesterday
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i still dont ban for chat things
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u banned ShootXen for keep tagging u one time :troll:
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> lol rly
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @snail will remember what @Learath2 calls me
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> deen called me an ass :feelsamazingman:
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> if so it was probably for like 1min xd
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 would you accept any scientific evidence as to that words do change stuff or is it a believe like "I believe that humans have a free will in a way that will never be influenced by the outside and science can't get in the way of that"?
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 would you accept any scientific evidence as to that words do change stuff or is it a belief like "I believe that humans have a free will in a way that will never be influenced by the outside and science can't get in the way of that"?
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't possibly imagine an experiment where you can judge that
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (note that I haven't searched for that kind of experiment)
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it's the latter
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> i think learath is unable to relate to others emotions/feelings
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I see such an experiment, sure I'm not going to argue against science
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but you might not be able to construct one is my point
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it's something that cannot be determined by science
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then it's unscientific (that's trying to be factual, this only seems to discredit it because we view "unscientific" = "bad") I think
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> science basically means "observing things"
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and if there's no experiment that can conclude whether a theory is true or false, then it is basically useless in the realm of science
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just because I can't imagine an experiment doesn't mean there can't be an experiment. I can't imagine an experiment that proves chirality doesn't matter either but people much smarter then me came up with one.
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but the thing is
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even before searching for an experiment
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you give yourself a good excuse to not accept it if it goes against your beliefs
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is my excuse? The experiment can very well be invalid
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> am I supposed to accept every claim that comes from a peer reviewed paper?
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so. what do you quantifiably mean by "words don't hurt"
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think words change actions and can go as far as make people dead that wouldn't be if it weren't for these words
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think words can change actions and can go as far as make people dead that wouldn't be if it weren't for these words
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean if a word hurts you it's because you want to get hurt by it, as my words can't possibly change anything in your life
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you phrase it like an axiom
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it sounds a bit like circular reasoning. a word can't hurt because a word can't hurt
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my theory is: I think words can hurt, because I think words can change actions (we could experimentally check that) and e.g. make people dead who otherwise wouldn't be
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so my claim has a verifiable claim in it
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so my claim has a verifiable statement in it
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i can help experiment
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @Learath2 go kill yourself fat cunt
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll go get some ropoe
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll go get some rope
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> you will need really thick rope
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ZombieToad telling people to kill themselves is not OK and will not be tolerated
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> i didnt say that
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> ur lying
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and don't go offtopic, we're having a discussion here 😉
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 my point is words can at most change your state of mind but I also believe they can only change your mind if you allow them to
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but making fun of it is okay @heinrich5991 ?
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 so they can change people's actions? and they will change some people's actions?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Who cares about dead people
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> they cant know
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not the words fault though, It's the person who takes them too seriously. Sure I wouldn't say stupid things around someone that is in a vulnerable state, but that doesn't mean that the words themselves are inherently bad
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> at most, I could be a bad person
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 👌
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but if we can observe that words can change what people do
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think we should do a #philosphy channel
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @jao
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and therefore hurt them. which we can scientifically observe
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think we should do a #philosophy channel
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> without assigning blame to who's "at fault"
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can see that
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not the words themselves hurting the person, it's the context and me as a person hurting them
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Hating people for their skin color my right :O
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 there's not really a "cause" of gravitation
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not the fault of the big body for having mass
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or the fault of the small body of having mass
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's the whole system that creates gravitational force
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ᶰ°Konͧsti and dismissing your opinion because it's undiscussable is my right
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I dont like fat people too
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> let's view our situation neutrally, @Learath2
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> :feelsbadman:
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Freedom of speech ded
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> link to relevant xkcd, @ᶰ°Konͧsti
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can do wathever u want while it doesnt affect another
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 you can't define the concept of "hurt" "bad" "good" but you can define gravity very well
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can define "hurt"
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can define hurt biologically
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hurt can be physically or emotionally, but you can scientifically observe both
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can define hurt in a biological manner
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also you can blame the fabric of spacetime for gravity if you really want to blame someone, but placing blame in that case does not change anything
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's my point
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we want to view the situation neutrally
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> without assigning blame
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> or I want to, right now
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can we do that? 🙂
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean sure but my perspective very much relies on that fact so I doubt I can argue for it without it
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> "fact"
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no one is "at fault" in the universe
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's a people thing
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you think every word is inherently good/bad/hurtful?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's a good exercise too, btw
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> neutral
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> understanding your "opponent"'s argument good enough that they'd agree with the statement after you paraphrase it
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think your statement is: words can't be good or bad, because you view the persons involved as having "free will" which means they can do whatever they want, without relying on any outside influence, because they're not bound by any words"
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think your statement is: words can't be good or bad, because you view the persons involved as having "free will" which means they can do whatever they want, without relying on any outside influence, because they're not bound by any words
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's it
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now we try to get you to a point where you can paraphrase my point? 😛
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so, we try to view the situation neutrally
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> without assigning blame
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are technically arguing that people don't really have "free will"
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not the start of my argument
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we're observing the situation
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we get that people can change actions based on words
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or that words are so powerful that they can influence your free will
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and that people can get emotionally hurt by words
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can see that, without saying who's at fault for that
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's their choice to do so
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's very much my choice to take @ZombieToad's advice to heart or not
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't want to assign blame 🙂
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just want to observe what happens when words are spoken
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and you're saying who the cause of the thing is
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that's not what I want to do. that's not really something I can define or experimentally find out
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had the choice of doing x or y before the words were spoken and I have the same choice after, the only thing it could have changed is which one I'm thinking to go for
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yet you still have the "free will" to go for either
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did anything actually change?
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why are you unwilling to temporarily let go of assigning whose at blame? ^^
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't assign any blame
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> responsibility
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> whatever
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no responsibility either
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the person is the only thing responsible for their actions
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just told you the state before and after a function, and asked whether anything changed
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is what you're saying
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> actually my argument is indefensible without pointing fingers, no point in arguing for it @heinrich5991
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I agree that words can "hurt" you in a world where responsibility and blame doesn't matter (and quite possibly "free will" can't really exist)
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so when one removes the people saying those hurtful words, one reduces hurt
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @heinrich5991 is it fixed on ddnet, that a tee can spawn on the other side of a block if the spawn i in a corner?
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and this is what I'm arguing for
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ᶰ°Konͧsti I don't know that bug 😮
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> lol
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Idk if it were every a thing on ddnet but it works on infclass for example
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but imho it's the opposite, when you give the people back their free will, actually it should decrease hurt
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if someones brain is deterministic and you manipulate it's state with your words you have unarguably hurt them
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> blame, responsibility and free will are the only things that make this discussion interesting otherwise it's fact
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but what is "free will"?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mostly value things that I can observe in some way
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> things or explanations
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you don't value your free will?
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't you think that "you"(whatever consciousness is) are the one making the decisions?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, what does "making decisions" mean? ^^
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I try to stay off arguments that have no foundation in things that one can observe
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but you can't just discard things that make you human and then just add them back in as if they don't change anything
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I completely 100% agree that without free-will, words do hurt people
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I completely 100% agree that without free-will, words can/ hurt people
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> stupid sed replacement thing
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ^^
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes. that's the different start points of us two, apparently
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we all should stop existing
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so we dont hurt anyone
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nothing can happen
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not nihilism day
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best solution
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xddd
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's tomorrow
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we have to learn how to suicide first
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I also do agree that If I say something and someone ends up actually hurt, it's most definitely my fault, no matter my intention
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> actually hurt = physically hurt?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> physically or emotionally hurt
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> doesn't change the fact that i'm free to say whatever I want
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's just that I was irresponsible or had bad intentions if it results in any hurt
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think everyone should be allowed to say whatever they want and if the majority doesn't want to hear what they are saying that person will just end up being ignored
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FluffiexD> @Admin @Moderator  what was with me?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> going back to work, @heinrich5991 gimme a highlight if you want to keep going
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I think we're pretty good now
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems like we understood each other's point
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess that's enough
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> gosh why is the show all mesages soooo long
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what about 5 chars max
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ``showall: ON`` and ``showoll: OFF`would be ok too i guess but these huughe text is confusign af
