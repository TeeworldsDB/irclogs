10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut done.
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> hey guys
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> nowadays we have many players have nicknames with unicode symbols, yea?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> so it's doing finding them so hard that we must remember ip or something other
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> can someone do the function of ddnet which will do the "second nickname" which will do the finding easier than we have now?
14:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Arseniy Zarche> for example, player with unicoded-nickname OXYGEN (just example) will put to this line (second nickname) "Oxygen" and other players can find him with nickname Oxygen, but on the server he will be an OXYGEN (unicoded)
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> a nickname like this 𝐎𝐗𝐘𝐆𝐄𝐍 ?
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> would actually be cool. Could be done using the same system that looks for same names, like `Hello` and `Hellô`. @heinrich5991 could you make something here?
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually there arent many players with unicode names
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can add them to friends and then easily find them
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> so what about this?

18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @archimede67 there was a comment by heinrich5991 that hasn't been addressed yet.
