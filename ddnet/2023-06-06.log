07:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i got the new discord username
07:49 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> now you are the one and only Ryozuki
07:50 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i tried ryo
07:50 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but taken
07:54 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> Thank goodness my username is long and obscure
07:54 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> They said this is getting released based on how old your account is, so it'll take a while lol
07:55 <+bridge> <louis> dang nice
07:57 <+bridge> <Voxel> just buy it from the black market for $9999999
07:57 <+bridge> <louis> oh wait my old account isf rom 2016 xd
07:58 <+bridge> <louis> maybe i should see if i can get a good username on that
07:59 <+bridge> <Voxel> god this new username thing sucks ass
08:00 <+bridge> <Voxel> discord had no reason to do this
08:00 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ü§ë
08:02 <+bridge> <Voxel> one reason
08:03 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> They like to bless us with features we didn't ask for
08:11 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> they actually had, there was a whole blog entry about it :)
08:11 <+bridge> <Voxel> and it sucks
08:12 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> why?
08:12 <+bridge> <Voxel> "WAAH THERE ARE 10000 PEOPLE WITH THE SAME USERNAME lets now have it so there can be only one of that name"
08:13 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> pretty common for basic names
08:13 <+bridge> <Voxel> cant wait for marklplier to contact me for a free giftcard
08:13 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Thing is they should fix their stupid app instead of working on things like this
08:13 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> and not only that, also people forgetting their number
08:13 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Yup
08:13 <+bridge> <ReiTW> + there's many useless features implemented
08:13 <+bridge> <Voxel> copy pasting:
08:13 <+bridge> <ReiTW> # this one is an example
08:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ur just envy u didnt get @ ryozuki
08:14 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Same for the nitro stupid emoji reaction
08:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :greenthing:
08:14 <+bridge> <Voxel> spam material
08:14 <+bridge> <Voxel> when did i imply that
08:14 <+bridge> <Voxel> go back to sucking off rust devs
08:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :TOOBASED:
08:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991
08:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no bias here
08:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
08:15 <+bridge> <Voxel> anyways im ü§è this close to switching to matrix
08:15 <+bridge> <Voxel> LMAO
08:16 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Fablab

08:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its the truth
08:16 <+bridge> <Voxel> dude lost so he pinged heinrich on me
08:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if i said that im timeouted 24h
08:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @fokkonaut too
08:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but ur fine dw
08:16 <+bridge> <Voxel> i dont care
08:16 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> sus
08:17 <+bridge> <Voxel> ANYWAYYYSSS
08:17 <+bridge> <Voxel> matrix
08:17 <+bridge> <louis> bruh looks like someone already got louis and loui
08:17 <+bridge> <louis> unfortunate
08:18 <+bridge> <Voxel> louistw
08:18 <+bridge> <louis> i will try to go for similar
08:18 <+bridge> <louis> nah im not gonna use tw

08:19 <+bridge> <ReiTW> Call urself lou then
08:20 <+bridge> <Voxel> can you theme element matrix
08:29 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> anybody knows why need to skip 48 bytes when try to get demo info :thonk:
08:29 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1115527848208384060/image.png
08:32 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> prob because of this `TWDEMO` (open a small demo file with a text editor)
08:33 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> not sure though
08:34 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> isnt TWDEMO is "magic" thing from version header
08:34 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1115529045334032494/image.png
08:35 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> not sure then
08:54 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> XDDDDD
08:56 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @ryozuki i dont even know how i should think about it anymore, should i laugh or cry
08:56 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xDD
08:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ChillerDragon: IRC bridge soon needs an update with the new discord names 
09:04 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it doesnt
09:05 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> traitor x2
09:07 <+bridge> <Patiga> its the ddnet map sha256 extension: 16 bytes for the uuid of the map sha extension and 32 bytes for the checksum
09:11 <+bridge> <Patiga> I currently have a demo rewrite branch on libtw2. I told heinrich to wait with merging until I finished my related project, my demo-renderer, since I might make more changes in that time period
09:14 <+ChillerDragon> !jup think it already works fine
09:14 < chillerbot1> @Jupstar ‚ú™

09:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> # #off-topic
09:19 <+bridge> <ferko> check bugs
09:20 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> oh ok, thanks =]
09:20 <+bridge> <ReiTW> tf
09:20 <+bridge> <ReiTW> # #off-topic
09:20 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> what
09:23 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @Robyt3 Did you work on the new editor features? Did you put the INFO button in the Settings context menu? It would be amazing if we can get it out of there again, its very inconvenient for mapping, as I use this feature regularly and it's very annoying to toggle it ONLY using the context menu.
09:33 <+bridge> <murpi> Does anyone have a copy of the `SDL2.dll` file from release candidate 2?
09:35 <+ChillerDragon> i can rename my bitcoinminer.dll to SDL2.dll and send it. will that work too?
09:35 <+bridge> <murpi> ddnet 17.0 release candidate 2*
09:35 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/releases/tag/17.0-rc2
09:36 <+ChillerDragon> isnt that only code @fokkonaut?
09:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> compile it, probably
09:36 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-libs/tree/master/sdl/windows/lib64
09:36 <+bridge> <murpi> If I could, I wouldn't have asked. ^^
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-libs/tree/a09487fa39f4c7d7a8af03e2f85da163da559f0b/sdl/windows/lib64
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> or this
09:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> not the right version, probably
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> idk which version is attached to what
09:37 <+ChillerDragon> the 2nd one might be it
09:47 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> my problem is that CMapLayers needs CComponent
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> reply moment
09:51 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> > i dunno if editor can access client code tho
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> reply service
09:51 <+ChillerDragon> thank
09:51 < ws-client> <Mr.Gh0s7> ;)
09:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Maybe i can build some reply helper
09:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like link to the last message sent by a person to guess which conversation this is about but that seems scuffed
09:52 < ws-client> <Mr.Gh0s7> that'd be cool
09:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk where to get the info from which message it was replied to
09:53 < ws-client> <Mr.Gh0s7> where's the code for irc/bridge?
09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for this here?
09:54 < ws-client> <Mr.Gh0s7> > idk where to get the info from which message it was replied to
09:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean for my webchat or the discord to irc bridge
09:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah ye thatd be in the bridge
09:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its matterbridge
09:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge
09:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye doing a pr here is probably the way to go for irc reply support
09:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay web client is much nicer on 2nd screen on laptop it feels bloat ima go back to weechat
09:56 < ws-client> <Mr.Gh0s7> https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/wiki/FAQ#replies-show-the-botname-instead-of-the-usernameavatar
09:56 < ws-client> <Mr.Gh0s7> k :)
09:56 < ws-client> <Mr.Gh0s7> it's prob already implemented (the replies)
09:56 <+ChillerDragon> yes 
09:56 < ws-client> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O msg didn't send
09:56 <+ChillerDragon> for things like matrix for exampke
09:56 <+ChillerDragon> but not for irc
09:57 < ws-client> <Mr.Gh0s7> oic
09:57 <+ChillerDragon> or heinrich didnt update the bridge in too long hehe
09:58 < ws-client> <Mr.Gh0s7> maybe this? https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/issues/1825
09:59 <+ChillerDragon> yes ima like dat bitsh
09:59 <+ChillerDragon> now THE HIGH DEMAND is indicated by the 4 upvotes hehe
10:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ah its golang
10:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i wont touch that
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> lol
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> omagawd @ryozuki small r !?

10:09 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> why?
10:09 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> he banned himself
10:10 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> fair
10:10 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon @ChillerDragon.*
10:10 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> see, even his dummy has discord

10:13 <+ChillerDragon> my @ChillerDragon acc is properly locked i can not login to without giving them my phone number
10:13 <+ChillerDragon> they never bothered to tell me why
10:13 <+ChillerDragon> classic discord
10:14 <+ChillerDragon> but yea watever then someone else claims the chillerdragon name idk i would probably not login anways. but might cause some confusion
10:14 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> If I was you I would claim it
10:14 <+ChillerDragon> ye but how .-.
10:14 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> otherwise cyberfighter or some comparable kek will do so
10:14 <+ChillerDragon> its not worth giving them my phone num
10:14 <+ChillerDragon> coberfita xd
10:15 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> get a fake number
10:15 <+ChillerDragon> expensive
10:15 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> nah u can make prepaid contracts basically for free
10:15 <+ChillerDragon> also then they throw 2fa when i later need in
10:15 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> and end it after 1 onth
10:15 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> and end it after 1 month
10:16 <+ChillerDragon> havent seen one of those below 20 bucks

10:16 <+ChillerDragon> scam
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> 0.00$
10:17 <+ChillerDragon> szre
10:17 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> all for free
10:17 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> shipping aswell
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> i dont trust it
10:18 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> you even get 1‚Ç¨ for start for free
10:18 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> so you pay -1‚Ç¨
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> also im for sure not buying a throw away online
10:18 <+ChillerDragon> where i have to give them my address and probably even more details
10:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ye ofc
10:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> u would do that in a o2 store
10:19 <+ChillerDragon> then they tell me mimimi online offer only xd
10:19 <+ChillerDragon> but ye ima try later thank 
10:19 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> you dont even need number for discord
10:19 <+ChillerDragon> i do

10:19 <+ChillerDragon> i can not login without 
10:20 <+ChillerDragon> they flagged me
10:20 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ah oke, then u can remove it later at least

10:20 <+ChillerDragon> wot
10:20 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> its ||zileraProPASSWORD2023pridem0nth||
10:21 <+ChillerDragon> wowo
10:25 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> chillerdragon:
10:26 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> !ryo
10:26 < chillerbot1> @Ryozuki
10:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I doubt we changed it compared to current release
10:30 <+ChillerDragon> wot
10:30 <+ChillerDragon> pinger
10:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !c ryos name was not his nickname. But if u already fixed it gg
10:30 < chillerbot1> ChillerDragon
10:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> does anyone know the calling convention in cpp
10:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is it fastcc
10:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in c its ccc
10:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> My guess is almost certainly implementation defined
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> !jup ah you mean lower case r vs uppercase R yea i am not fixing anything i use what irc gives me
10:39 < chillerbot1> @Jupstar ‚ú™
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> and irc gives me the username instead of the display name apparently
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> so this is @matterbridge devs or @heinrich updating matterbridge
10:39 <+ChillerDragon> i am yet to become a go hacking matterbridge dev
11:52 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> good idea
12:01 <+ChillerDragon> !
12:12 <+bridge> <Learath2> Eeeh, neither C nor C++ specify a calling convention. That‚Äôs left to the implementation
12:13 <+bridge> <Learath2> And the implementation is not forced to stick to one either. E.g. winapi calls use a different one than the msvc default
12:15 <+bridge> <Learath2> I guess on 64bit it‚Äôs a bit better, you can safe-ishly assume one calling convention per OS
12:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Learath2 do u think if i use the libclang library and get the cconv from it, is it safe to assume it will be that one
12:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this is only linux thing too
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> ``apt install ddnet-server``
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> ``DDNet-Server``
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> ``DDNet-Server: error while loading shared libraries: libantibot.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> A
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> debian moment
12:19 <+bridge> <Learath2> With code you didn‚Äôt compile there is no way to know for sure. But I think this will work with all sane code
12:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Learath2 what if it is a dynamic linked lib
12:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> doesnt it need a stable abi
12:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or smth
12:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the lib in question is llvm so
12:23 <+bridge> <Learath2> There is no way to be 100% correct about this, so just pick the sane assumption and go with it. Assuming a binary doesn‚Äôt break ABI promises is sane. Especially calling into something like llvm. LLVM isn‚Äôt adversarial üòÑ
12:24 <+bridge> <Learath2> On linux 64bit you‚Äôll always have sysv amd64 abi
12:25 <+bridge> <Learath2> On 32 bit linux you‚Äôll get cdecl
12:25 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @Learath2 do you smoke by any chance?
12:25 <+bridge> <Learath2> Extremely rarely, why?
12:26 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Just wondering, because I barely know any turkish people who dont smoke.
12:26 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> And I've been "smoking" the IQOS since a few months, now got the new generation which was released in Germany a few days ago.
12:27 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I know, its still tobacco industry which I am feeding this way (Philipp Morris), but for me it's _the_ alternative to smoking.
12:27 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I dont like all these vapes shit and e-liquids etc
12:28 <+bridge> <Learath2> Ah and thiscall for member functions, which is pretty much cdecl but put this on stack too
13:27 < ws-client> <Jupstar> !c yeah that's why i talked about updating IRC bridge xd. this will be confusing af :joy:
13:27 < chillerbot1> ChillerDragon
13:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if im 23y old and teaching someone in the company rust am i a senior?
13:36 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
13:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> if the someone is 12, no :joy:
13:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> so if u teach learath, no
13:44 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 12 pog number
13:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he is older than me
13:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
13:45 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I tried it and didn't like the result. It feels unnecessary
13:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 2 years
13:46 <+bridge> <Robyt3> dragging is not really necessary, but I'd prefer if the button was somewhere else and not random together with the other file operation buttons
13:46 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> oic ok I'll do that
13:47 <+bridge> <Robyt3> hmm, you can also use Ctrl+I for your power-user needs
13:54 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Should the preview collapse if the selected path isn't a map or if you have enabled map preview it should always split the view?
13:56 <+bridge> <Robyt3> I don't have an answer right now, I'd try both and choose the one that feels better to use
13:57 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Yeah. I used both and it feels weird if it collapses all the time
13:57 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Maybe look at what other games/applications do
14:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/anime-transformation-serious-gif-13584049
14:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> apparmor
14:04 <+ChillerDragon> weeb
14:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you do realize I'm not online 24/7?
14:05 <+ChillerDragon> no
14:05 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> no
14:05 <+bridge> <Teero> :justatest:
14:06 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> the reddit post where a discord dev said to add numbers on your name if its taken
14:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar maybe @heinrich5991 can try this https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/wiki/Settings#useusername
14:07 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> @Jupeyy_Keks
14:08 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> :gigachad:
14:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter send gigachad emote image pls
14:08 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I couldn't remove it after being asked by discord for a phone number. when I removed it, it'd always ask me for a new one
14:08 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> im on mobile i dont think i can rip the images
14:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a shit
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont get why everybody just puts up with this discord bs
14:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its clearly a hostile platform
14:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > Starting with Visual Studio 2013, Microsoft introduced the __vectorcall calling convention which extends the x64 convention.
14:11 <+bridge> <Voxel> your username being taken wasnt a problem before so idk why they decided to do this
14:11 <+bridge> <Learath2> it's only an extension of their x64 convention which is mostly(tm) compatible iirc
14:12 <+bridge> <Voxel> do you think discord's trying to become the same type of social media platform as twitter or facebook or smth
14:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > `__vectorcall` adds support for passing homogeneous vector aggregate (HVA) values, which are composite types (structs) consisting solely of up to four identical vector types, using the same six registers. Once the registers have been allocated for vector type arguments, the unused registers are allocated to HVA arguments from left to right. The positioning rules still apply. Resulting vector type and HVA values are returned using the first f
14:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not compatible if you have these
14:13 <+bridge> <Learath2> Does anyone know if nmap can be used to map out open udp ports when you have access to both sides of the connection?
14:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> nmap can be used to find open udp ports, yes
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> trol
14:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's just slow
14:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> because linux limits the "connection refused" thing for UDP to like 1/s
14:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> globally
14:14 <+bridge> <Learath2> but I need to know for certain, not just "it didn't return icmp unreachable"
14:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think lerato is searching for a tool that actually binds a port on the host 
14:15 <+bridge> <Learath2> if the firewall is dropping the packets they would never return icmp unreachable
14:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I still don't quite get it
14:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if you have access to the server, `ss -u` or similar would tell you the ports, no
14:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ?
14:16 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> wait chiller
14:17 <+bridge> <Learath2> Problem is there is DDNet TUR, there just has to be a firewall rule blocking every udp connection but idk how to show it to this braindead hoster
14:17 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> does ddnet bot work here

14:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> host some echo server maybe
14:19 <+ChillerDragon> very nice @cyberFighter yes thanks
14:19 <+bridge> <Learath2> I showed him this, he said there is no problem...

14:20 <+ChillerDragon> @cyberFighter now i still need the discord ids :D 
14:20 <+ChillerDragon> is there non linux debian!?
14:21 <+ChillerDragon> >  is a Linux-specific feature and Debian packages shouldn't assume it is present (unless they're Linux-specific packages for some reason)
14:21 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> how do u get the discord ids
14:21 <+ChillerDragon> LINUX SPECIFIC DEBIAN PACKAGES!? xd
14:21 <+ChillerDragon> might not work on mobile
14:21 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll:
14:22 <+ChillerDragon> but if i send for example :gigachad: you should be able to see the emote number somewhere
14:22 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll:
14:22 <+ChillerDragon> wait i can not send it
14:22 <+ChillerDragon> only u can send it
14:22 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> did it send the numbers
14:22 <+ChillerDragon> no they do not arrive here
14:22 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll :
14:22 <+ChillerDragon> i dont think u can send them like this
14:22 <+ChillerDragon> just look em up
14:22 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 could you bridge more channels for off topic?
14:23 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> heinrich no
14:23 <+ChillerDragon> like at least one more
14:23 <+ChillerDragon> #off-topic
14:23 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> dont let him conquer the server
14:23 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ChillerDragon: to me it reads as if whatever you mean is a linux specific feature, but not all binaries shipped for debian are linux only
14:23 <+ChillerDragon> isnt a binary os dependent?
14:23 <+bridge> <ReiTW> why putty when windows implements a ssh client
14:23 <+bridge> <ReiTW> with config files etc..
14:23 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> :gigachad:
14:24 <+ChillerDragon> @ReiTW ?
14:24 < ws-client> <Jupstar> it is chillerdragon, but i dont even know what feature we talk about xD
14:24 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> 960830678465933403
14:24 <+bridge> <Learath2> because I almost never boot into windows anymore and I cba to move stuff over
14:24 < ws-client> <Jupstar> u just posted some random quote
14:24 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> chiler its working for me
14:24 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I'd prefer to see them bridged to matrix first, tbh
14:25 <+ChillerDragon> pro @cyberFighter thank
14:25 < ws-client> <Jupstar> from irc to bloat to bloat
14:25 < ws-client> <Jupstar> :joy
14:25 < ws-client> <Jupstar> :
14:25 < ws-client> <Jupstar> chillerdragon: when discord ppl use emotes, i see emotes. when i use them i dont :c
14:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: why send usernames instead of discord-specific names?
14:26 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> do u want me to do it for every single emote
14:26 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 who uses matrix anyways? its so bugged but yea if thats a requirement then go for it takes 2s to bridge matrix
14:26 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 jupsti wanted that
14:26 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i just said that discords new naming will not work with irc
14:26 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i see ryozukis username
14:26 < ws-client> <Jupstar> instead of his nickname
14:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> aah
14:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar because the :joy: emote does not work only :pepeH: and a few handselected
14:27 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> yea discord sucks i should change to server bridges too
14:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess matterbridge needs to be updated in a way @Jupeyy_Keks
14:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/discord-irc/tree/master/src/img/emotes
14:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !c üòÇ
14:27 < chillerbot1> ChillerDragon
14:27 < ws-client> <Jupstar> then discord converts them
14:27 < ws-client> <Jupstar> to unicode
14:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
14:28 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> !c :greenthing:
14:28 < chillerbot1> ChillerDragon
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not supported yet
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but with ur folder ill add more
14:28 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> btw bridges cant see reactions right?
14:28 <+bridge> <Learath2> This clearly illustrates an issue, no?
14:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 who bridges matrix? zwelf?
14:28 <+bridge> <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1115618296855793665/image.png

14:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> We've been over this. I cba to configure ssh on windows because I only use windows once every month
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whats cba
14:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'm on windows because MATLAB decided not to work today and I don't have the time to mess around with it today

18:17 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> makes sense
18:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i didnt know i miss emote spam so much before it was taken away
18:18 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> is it still working on kog
18:18 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll: :troll: :troll: :troll:
18:18 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> :justatest:
18:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no ;~;
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> whats emote spam
18:20 <+ChillerDragon> u mean sv_emoticon_delay ?
18:20 <+bridge> <louis> https://tenor.com/view/spam-spamalert-gif-20933994
18:20 <+bridge> <louis> they added a spam emote but due to protest it got removed
18:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> fng already fixed bcs without emotes, this game is not playable
18:25 <+bridge> <Cellegen | RiH> noby goated programmer
18:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i meant on my servers üòÇ
18:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> NVM ME
18:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but srsly @Learath2 10 bytes * 64
18:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> are under 1kb/s
18:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dont make me cry
18:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> You are so angry you are misreading code. Can you chill for a second?
18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bro i only want once per tick
18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all i want
18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò≠
18:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not 5 per second
18:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1115679783553093722/image.png
18:33 <+bridge> <Learath2> We thought 10 ticks was a reasonable amount. I forgot some of you people are attached to the weirdest things
18:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> here this is the emotion right?
18:33 <+bridge> <Learath2> We can do once per tick, see if the servers can do it
18:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this are 8 bytes, plus 8 bytes packet payload, plus maybe 8 bytes UDP
18:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1.5 KB/s
18:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and the calc is conservative
18:34 <+bridge> <Learath2> It‚Äôs not the traffic causing lag, it‚Äôs the cpu as far as I understand
18:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its less ofc
18:34 <+bridge> <Learath2> Especially on our weaker servers that many packets entering the queue can cause issues. Anyway, let‚Äôs try 1 per tick, see if that helps
18:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have seen old block servers being taken down by holding shift xd
18:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but ye pls fast emotes they important for gameplay feel
18:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why by holding shift?
18:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> isnt that a input flag
18:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because windows sends emotes really fast when a emote bind is held
18:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean we send a snapshot every second tick
18:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that must be more than a stupid emoticon
18:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the block server had the emote delay set to 0
18:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and it would straight up connection problem xd
18:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> even on a local server, i get like 40KB/s with single char
18:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the 1 KB/s extra per character should be fine
18:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> are under 1kb/s/char
18:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Make 1 second on weak servers üòÇ
18:44 <+bridge> <Learath2> You are not considering the shitty vps‚Äôs and the shitty connections we run these on, but anyway, there is no harm to trying 1 per tick
19:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we fought so hard to not convince qshar for this üòÇ
19:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> I love how even in low bandwidth you couldn't get yourself to make it less than 0.5 emotes per tick üòÑ
19:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think kog only activated it after avo got admin xD
19:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can hold emote key
19:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how often does it trigger?
19:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> Depends on your OS settings
19:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say more than 5 times üòÑ
19:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 5 times completely kills me
19:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1115689625793609760/Tutorial_2023-06-06_19-11-45.demo.mp4
19:13 <+bridge> <Learath2> I mean I think that looks fine, a fairly normal amount of emoticons
19:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sometimes i join random servers
19:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> stand next to a random tee
19:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and spam him heart emotes
19:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Learath2 if a cpp function is marked inline
19:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u should be able to use it externally right?
19:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> today im exploding
19:17 <+bridge> <Chairn> yes
19:17 <+bridge> <Chairn> inline is just an indication to the compiler, not an order
19:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so its symbol is available?
19:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
19:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> thats the problem i guess
19:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my linker couldnt find it
19:18 <+bridge> <Chairn> how have you declared it inline?
19:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and i knew its mangled name
19:18 <+bridge> <Chairn> in the header, or in the implementation?
19:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> via libclang
19:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```

19:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i know what im doing is already hacky
19:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> I didn't know that the emotespam you desired looked like a seizure. Most people I play with spam only at a human rate, which looks like about what you posted there
19:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they probs use them with a bind
19:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hook or fire
19:21 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'd guess they are just spamming through the emotewheel
19:22 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> some spam with bind and hold it
19:23 <+bridge> <Chairn> apparently not, just tried with gcc
19:23 <+bridge> <Learath2> It honestly looks awful when you spam much faster than 10 times per second, but as this is ddnet once you add something you can never remove it, so I guess it'll be a part of the game forevermore
19:23 <+bridge> <Chairn> a.h

19:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> pls dont have a strong opinion, else heinrich reads it and comes with his strong opinion and then im alone in the dev team, while whole EU community will hate it üòÇ
19:25 <+bridge> <Chairn> compiling a.c already yields:

19:25 <+bridge> <Chairn> ```
19:25 <+bridge> <Learath2> Subtly injecting the assertion that the "whole EU" community wants to spam at the seizure rate üôÉ
19:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they want it, 100% sure about it üòÇ
19:27 <+bridge> <Learath2> Given the fact that I rarely ever saw it used I'm a little skeptical on that but anyway there is no need to debate this, I know better than to take a solid position on this one
19:27 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'd rather break my arm than merge anything you don't like
19:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i didnt read but ill support u
19:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> With gnu89 that should link iirc üòÑ
19:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why
19:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> tell me
19:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna be funny at work
19:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, C99: 6.7.4p6:
19:32 <+bridge> <Learath2> > ... If all of the file scope declarations for a function in a translation unit include the inline function specifier without extern is an inline definition. An inline definition does not provide an external definition for the function ...
19:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> seem like i know a lot
19:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> kek
19:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> besides the export of the symbol, this is funny fact too:
19:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
19:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     inline marks the symbol WEAK, which hints linker to choose arbitary one of definition in object files
19:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     static marks the symbol LOCAL, which restricts the symbol in current translation unit, and the linker may keep multiple instances of (possibly different) definition.
19:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>     static inline generally works as static, but the inline keyword suggest compiler trying to inline this function.
19:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
19:33 <+bridge> <Learath2> Because inline wasn't a standard thing back in c89, and I remember reading in the C irc that gcc just decided to do it that way
19:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> Anyway, C99: 6.7.4p6:
19:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> > ... If all of the file scope declarations for a function in a translation unit include the inline function specifier without extern, then the definition in that translation unit is an inline definition.
19:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> > An inline definition does not provide an external definition for the function ...
19:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> I hate copying from pdfs
19:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lolo
19:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nice to know
19:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cool trivia
19:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> irc experts saving the day
19:38 <+bridge> <lolkildal> I do not know if it was mentioned before, but why not make it so that, a person could spam for themselves as many emotions as they want, but to the server will be sent only once 0.3 seconds for example. This will save from ddos and will not bring discomfort for people. I think win win
19:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> have u actually learned the whole c spec? üòÇ
19:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the issue is a different than u think
19:39 <+bridge> <Learath2> For C99 I kinda know the approximate locations of the things
19:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> currently u could spam multiple emotes per tick
19:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if that is fixed there is no DDOS possibility anymore
19:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> besides that u can always ddos the server itself
19:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> impressive xD
19:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I am a jedi, i feel the source
19:40 <+bridge> <Learath2> We could fake it on the client, but I doubt that'll make anyone happy. Lot's of extra new code so bad for the maintainters and @Jupeyy_Keks won't accept it as a good solution anyway, other people need to see it for it to convey emotions properly
19:41 <+bridge> <Learath2> Idk what emotion other than "seizure" is conveyed through an emote spam that fast, but that's above my paygrade
19:41 <+bridge> <lolkildal> Is this the way servers are being puffed up now, or is this one of them?
19:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> Recently I've been enjoying control theory quite a lot. Have any of you encountered it before? It's such an intriguing field
19:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u mean the weird players joining
19:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats smth different
19:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> A way to generalize so many things
19:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the multiple emotes per tick is a way to abuse the server so, that the server sends many packages to clients
19:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so u basically abuse the server for a DOS
19:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as said, u can always ddos the server, it's nothing special really
19:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> other way around is special
19:47 <+bridge> <Learath2> THIS absolute moron at this turkish hoster told me to use `tracert` to diagnose an issue with UDP traffic. Traceroutes are over ICMP on windows. So this moron keeps doing traceroutes to the server on windows and keeps saying it's okay
19:47 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'm about to lose it
19:47 <+bridge> <Learath2> How do you own an operate an entire hosting company without even knowing the basics of computers?
19:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> believe me. i think that every day
19:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> in many fields
19:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
19:49 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'm seriously this close to breaking this keyboard in half
19:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Hosting is an easy way to get money nowadays, many people with missing knowledge try to use this
19:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean i also google to solve many problems... but at least i DO so
19:50 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> And they hire people with even less knowledge
19:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
19:59 <+bridge> <Learath2> do you think this many traceroutes will convince him or will he just claim every server I could get my hands on is misconfigured?

20:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is it hard for a non uni goer
20:04 <+bridge> <ReiTW> chillerdragon: to answer ur "?" windows since some times implements a unix-style ssh client
20:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> sometimes i feel i wanna improve my maths like i do with programming
20:04 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> ?
20:04 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Which ?
20:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i heard ppl get a click on hard math stuff like u get with programming
20:05 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea windows has openssh no need for putty
20:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk  the word
20:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> anyway im lazy
20:05 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Why do math when you can do meth
20:07 <+bridge> <Learath2> Incompetence at this level drives me so insane
20:07 <+bridge> <Learath2> Hm, might be yeah, it's heavy on signal theory and linear algebra :/
20:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> at some point in my life i wanna learn advanced math
20:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but not today i guess
20:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> otherwise i feel i missed on smth
20:08 <+bridge> <Chairn> linear control theory is ok, non linear control theory is wtf
20:09 <+bridge> <Chairn> clearly not my best memories in uni
20:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> whats the thing u most enjoyed
20:09 <+bridge> <Learath2> non linear control theory sounds awful, please don't say that again
20:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if any
20:10 <+bridge> <Learath2> The beauty I saw in it lies solely in the fact that everything is nice and linear üòÑ
20:10 <+bridge> <Chairn> first 2 years, i enjoyed math, then mostly analogic electronic
20:10 <+bridge> <Chairn> or electronic and informatics, but my cursus wasn't really heavy on that
20:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> woah the metro has a new version
20:11 <+bridge> <Chairn> i also had civil engineering in 3rd year, and we did some nice experiments by crushing concrete üòÑ
20:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it has like digital panels showing station info
20:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> peak tech

20:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yee its nice
20:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Learath2 it even tells the station exists
20:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> usually there are 2
20:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so it tells street names
20:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and left or right

20:22 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes so I was right
20:22 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> (@Learath2)
20:22 <+bridge> <Learath2> German universities hard to get in
20:22 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> So you Italian
20:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> bambino
20:22 <+bridge> <Learath2> Does living just half a decade convert your nationality?
20:22 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes
20:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ü§è
20:23 <+bridge> <Learath2> off-topic: I was going to order some kfc (random craving moment). It says 40 to 60 minutes to delivery....

20:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk the name
20:23 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> did you try walking to kfc?
20:23 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Delivery leaks your address
20:23 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs not very privacy respecting
20:23 <+bridge> <Learath2> Pizza Napoletana? Yeah but not in Naples yet
20:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in naples ofc
20:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i heard its legit there

20:24 <+bridge> <Learath2> I cba to go down there, it's a 6 hour train ride atleast üòÑ
20:24 <+bridge> <Learath2> Maybe some day
20:24 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> 6 hour train stop ride to kfc
20:24 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Rude
20:24 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Omg
20:24 <+bridge> <Learath2> I want to go to Pepe in Grani, the best pizza place ever

20:25 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I also saw a notification from you
20:26 <+bridge> <Learath2> I speak a fair bit, but not very good at it
20:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i speak latin
20:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> are germans proud of their cuisine?
20:26 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Ciao
20:26 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Luigi
20:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no? XD
20:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> as an outsider there are simply no german restaurants
20:26 <+bridge> <Learath2> I never developed any social relationships so I never learned any conversational Italian :AnyaSob:
20:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
20:26 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> ciao Bella
20:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we all eat at turkish restaurants
20:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> D√∂ner
20:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> only german beer
20:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> D√ñNER
20:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> t√ºrkische Pizza
20:27 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> D√∂ner is German
20:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> some turkish places are dope
20:27 <+bridge> <Learath2> The bastardized version of Doner we consume in the west is actually very sad
20:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i like kebab :justatest:
20:27 <+bridge> <Learath2> I'll go buy pizza in person, I cba to wait 25 minutes for a delivery
20:28 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Good!
20:28 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> can‚Äôt be assed
20:28 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Axaxaxa
20:28 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Such a mood acronym
20:29 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> So when do we do a big meetup now?
20:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1115709245875294248/RDT_20230606_203004514761147227408667.jpg
20:31 <+bridge> <Learath2> My french is better than my italian and both are better than the abysmal state my japanese is in
20:34 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> how did you learn japanese from textbooks?
20:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no spanish?
20:35 <+bridge> <Learath2> From online resources and listening. It's abysmal state is because I kinda stopped working at it after a while because had to study boring engineering things instead
20:35 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> cool
20:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> https://www.imabi.net/ if you are a language enthusiast
20:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/ if you just want to learn
20:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> 
20:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> Both great resources that vibe with my kind of learning
20:36 <+bridge> <Learath2> I mean if you are interested in learning japanese yourself
20:39 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Sometime ago I learn hiragana in an afternoon. The next day I learn katakana. Afterwards I couldn't find resources so I stopped practicing them. Again sometime ago I re-learned katakana and hiragana now I've forgotten them again ^^. It's always fun for me to learn {hiraga,kataka}na
20:41 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> tfw you type a long msg send it and then see obvious mistakes in grammar/vocabulary but you can't edit it because it'll spam irc :kek:
20:42 <+bridge> <Learath2> Before I stopped practicing I could read text in kana easily, I wonder if I can still do it
20:42 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> „Éü„Çπ„Çø „Ç¥„Çπ„Éà
20:43 <+bridge> <Learath2> Seems I can still do it, nice
20:44 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think you want long letters for the „Ç¥
20:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's what I thought
20:44 <+bridge> <Learath2> „Ç¥„Éº„Çπ„Éàsounds better to me
20:45 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah but I got it from google translate (I wrote Misuta Gosuto and copied the japanese wording)
20:45 <+bridge> <Robyt3> you can type english "ghost" and translate to japanese to get „Ç¥„Éº„Çπ„Éà
20:46 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> „Éü„Çπ„Çø„Éº„Éª„Ç¥„Éº„Çπ„Éà better?
20:46 <+bridge> <Robyt3> if you click on the japanese translation you can switch to the katakana alternative
20:46 <+bridge> <Learath2> Sounds better to me, but what do I know, I'm just a weeb
20:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds better to me as well üôÇ
