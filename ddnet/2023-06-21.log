00:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> most media is 44.1
00:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> and from 44.1 -> 192 the interpolation is much more intensive than from 44.1 -> 48
00:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> but it kind of depends on which resampling algorithm you choose and pulse/pipewire come with a lot of them already implemented
00:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> also i don't think this is technically any more accurate. yes, interpolation is usually a part of the resampling process when not converting between factors
00:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> but the process is still resampling
00:21 <+bridge> <deen> Fixed now
00:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> and from 44.1 -> 192 the interpolation is much more expensive than from 44.1 -> 48
11:03 <+bridge> <germanysnexttopmodel> https://influck.notion.site/Choosing-the-right-teeworlds-server-version-for-your-mod-read-it-FIRST-116e42c219c34171a8b680b3c2f9be89
11:03 <+bridge> <germanysnexttopmodel> Does this still apply?
11:09 <+bridge> <learath2> Sounds about right, though it underplays how annoying it is to get the vanilla stuff back into ddnet
11:09 <+bridge> <learath2> I think @tsfreddie had a fork that did most of the work removing the ddnet specifics
11:10 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> i did
11:10 <+bridge> <deen> There is also https://github.com/teemods/ddnet-skeleton for making your own mod
11:10 <+bridge> <germanysnexttopmodel> So your fork is basically improved teeworlds 0.6+0.7?
11:10 <+bridge> <germanysnexttopmodel> Ah, nice thanks
11:11 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> https://github.com/teeworldscn/ddnet-pvp
11:11 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> mine
11:11 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> it was old tho
11:12 <+bridge> <germanysnexttopmodel> thank you
11:13 <+bridge> <deen> There is some documentation in ddnet-skeleton too: https://github.com/teemods/ddnet-skeleton-readme
11:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teemods/ddnet-skeleton-readme definitely has wrong documentation about gameflags
11:53 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> > Depending on the size of the mod and amount of time you can spent daily on your project it porting it to the right codebase will take anywhere from 1 week to 2 months.
11:53 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xdxd i ported ddnet to 0.7 codebase in 20h without break
12:43 <+bridge> <becc> when ddnet in rust? :frozen:
12:46 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ryozuki get off your alt account
12:50 <+bridge> <becc> >:(
12:52 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :santatrollet:
12:52 <+bridge> <becc> How do ddnet servers accept both 06 and 07 clients? Implemented both protocols and then check which version the client uses?
12:52 <+bridge> <becc> Or is there any kind of Middleware/Proxy in between?
12:54 <+bridge> <learath2> Implemented both protocols. They are similar enough to share most of the code
12:57 <+bridge> <becc> Ah, thanks
12:57 <+bridge> <becc> And ddnet 0.6 fixed the teeworlds 0.6 vulnerabilities as well?
13:02 <+bridge> <learath2> Yes
13:10 <+bridge> <becc> perfect, thanks
13:10 <+bridge> <becc> 
13:10 <+bridge> <becc> but.. why was there a need for a newer protocol then? new functions / features?
13:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> mostly a cleaner version than the backward compatible ddnet protocol
14:00 <+bridge> <plowerx> @muhistar18
16:20 <+bridge> <becc> ddnet protocol = the fixed 0.6?
16:21 <+bridge> <deen> yes
16:38 <+bridge> <learath2> We fixed the issues in a way that doesn't break compatibility. 0.7 fixed them in a way that does
16:55 <+bridge> <becc> Thaaanks!
16:55 <+bridge> <becc> The best documentation that exists is this?
16:56 <+bridge> <becc> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2
16:57 <+bridge> <learath2> Yep
17:39 <+ChillerDragon> @becc docs for what? i also put quite some time into network docs here https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/index.html
20:10 <+bridge> <gerdoe> @heinrich5991 messing around with libtw2 again, can you help me with snapshot builder?
20:10 <+bridge> <gerdoe> seems adding spectator_info breaks it with duplicate key
20:10 <+bridge> <gerdoe> whats the reason of dup?
20:12 <+bridge> <gerdoe> theres also good comment kekw
20:12 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ```rust
20:12 <+bridge> <gerdoe> // TODO: Fix ID!```
20:16 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> i love weird dev comments
20:16 <+bridge> <gerdoe> there's mine
20:16 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ```rust
20:16 <+bridge> <gerdoe>             (&Ingame(..), SystemOrGame::Game(Game::ClKill(..))) => {
20:16 <+bridge> <gerdoe>                 // todo: kill yourself
20:16 <+bridge> <gerdoe>                 // processed = true;
20:16 <+bridge> <gerdoe>             }```
20:24 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> :troll:
22:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @gerdoe what do you mean, it breaks with duplicate key?
22:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you're not allowed to put two objects with the same key into a snapshot
22:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> does that error happen without you doing that explicitly?
23:44 <+bridge> <zwelf2> How did you find that website? Do you know who the author is?
23:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I've seen that page before
23:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it was probably linked here
23:46 <+bridge> <becc> I am sorry, I cannot remember - someone sent this to me a few years ago
23:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> here
23:48 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @zwelf2 ^
23:51 <+bridge> <becc> wow end 2020 since I never started my plans.. ðŸ¥²
23:54 <+bridge> <zwelf2> do you still know who that deleted user is?
23:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ^
