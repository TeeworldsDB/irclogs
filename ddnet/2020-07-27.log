20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 ok, probably not an option to build it
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> on my machine it takes 80s to compile the amalgamation
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that makes the build too long
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so I somehow need to generate a .dll with accompanying .lib
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Drocsi D.> i have a idea to improve practice mode.
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Drocsi D.> my understanding ia that as soon as you type /practice your run gets invalidated.  but can you make it so that if you type it again you go to the spot where you first went into practice?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Drocsi D.> could work with the help of the new rescue system where you loose your guns and stuff
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> sounds good
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> I feel like that would open up big can of worms in terms of exploiting, and /practice already caused a bunch already lol. I like the idea though
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i had the same idea
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^ that 7th birthday picture looks exactly like my new wallpaper
