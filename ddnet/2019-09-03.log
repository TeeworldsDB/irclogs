06:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 if we replace the ninja check with the extended net obj freeze flag, then we can simply make it serverside because then it would be on ddnet servers only anyways
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 but which version of curl to link against? Hard to know which distro has which
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and even worse, curl brings openssl with it, which has dozens of incompatible versions
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but yeah, it's a pain to update these libs every time there is a security update
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you sure the serverside fix is as good?
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It often is not
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Look at faketune e.g.
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But we should definitely support vanilla clients
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen Can you send me a link of the commit where it was serverside?
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (freezeinput)
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not rly
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyone who plays ddnet with vanilla client is doomed to be bad
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut can't find it anymore, sorry :/
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :/
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen what do you mean, which version?
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you link to whatever you want, it takes the soname `libcurl.so.4`, and that works with whatever library the distro ships
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only glibc names are versioned
17:29 <+Learath2> so weird that no one ever reverse engineered a modems firmware
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym?
17:29 <+Learath2> like there is always a proprietary blob involved if you want to do xDSL
17:32 <+Learath2> also, on a more on topic note, linking to libcurl dynamically, we'd have to check whether any of the functions we use have a specific version requirement
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Learath2: https://gist.github.com/heinrich5991/4f2f7286fbe08a257bceee438618c565
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> quick survey of all the functions we use. it doesn't hurt to call the one that is only supported since 7.57.0, it will simply return an error (which we ignore)
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's a nice list
