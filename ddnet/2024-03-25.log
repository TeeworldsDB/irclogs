02:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Sounds dangerous do you have be backups?
02:37 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No backups?
03:19 < bridge> <teero777> no backups
03:22 < bridge> <Ewan> No bitches?
03:24 < bridge> <teero777> https://tenor.com/view/mila-kunis-im-the-back-up-plan-gif-12965066
03:25 < bridge> <teero777> My brain has stored most of the data
06:48 < bridge> <teero777> yo
06:48 < bridge> <teero777> making tunes more precise would be game-breaking right?
06:49 < bridge> <teero777> currently they are only int / 100
06:49 < bridge> <teero777> which is very annoying
07:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan i think the amount of backups and bitches is an inverse correlation actually :D 
07:36 < bridge> <teero777> okay so im fated to find some backups?
07:37 < bridge> <teero777> thats cool
07:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 you should try this time its 0 effort to do a ``git init && git add . && git commit -m init && git remote add origin git@github.com:nob/dotfiles``
07:37 < bridge> <teero777> where? .config?
07:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wherever u have configs
07:38 < bridge> <teero777> i mean id have to write a big .gitignore
07:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> any file that you need tomorrow should be tracked in git
07:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can also do inverse gitignore and make it a whitelist
07:39 < bridge> <teero777> so thats why your github activity looks so green
07:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk where you store your configs if they actually all are in .config you can gitignore * there and then add ``!htoprc`` or whatever rc file you have there
07:39 < bridge> <teero777> you just update your dotfiles daily xD
07:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 not only my dotfiles. Every time i close my laptop lid my harddrive could burn and i would have 0 data loss.
07:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i push my fakin pictures folder and tw demos to github xd
07:41 < bridge> <teero777> https://tenor.com/view/cpu-on-smoke-cpu-blasts-potato-pc-gif-24592403
07:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/bash_history
07:41 < bridge> <teero777> gh servers when chiller commits his 7 terabytes of demos haha
07:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can git pull my bash history from github xd
07:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @teero777 and now i started mirroring to gitlab and codeberg because i dont trust github as the only backup location
07:42 < bridge> <teero777> cant you get banned for uploading random shit? xD
07:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can
07:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i got like 5 gh accounts banned
07:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and one warning on codeberg
07:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
07:43 < bridge> <teero777> :owo:
07:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ofc you also gotta backup accounts
07:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> github.com/ChillerDragon-backup
07:43 < bridge> <teero777> nice 17 line history xd
07:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i could only think of 17 lines i need
07:44 < bridge> <teero777> chiller do you like math?
07:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the rest was just a bunch of vim/cd/ddnet
07:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i hate math
07:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i like meth
07:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok afk
07:44 < bridge> <teero777> ok cool üëç
07:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but rly do backups of ur settings if they are work  to setup
07:45 < bridge> <teero777> kk thx

16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u follow ffmpeg on twitter?
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://twitter.com/FFmpeg/status/1771944230333694056
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> there are rust zealots, but also C ones xd
16:13 < bridge> <learath2> Not really
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> they are liek 24/7 posting about C this C that
16:13 < bridge> <learath2> I 1000% agree with this tweet
16:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> obviously since rust taken off
16:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i guess this https://twitter.com/FFmpeg/status/1771343297899815344 was published because there was talks about C++ in linux
16:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i dislike the bad faith argument that u cant do low level in rust
16:14 < bridge> <learath2> It doesn't have to be C though. "Low level" programming is essential
16:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> he seems to imply u can only do it with C
16:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> and also there arent C compilers for every chip out there like he says in their twits
16:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know, but i bet if we ask them they wont agree rust can be low level xd
16:15 < bridge> <learath2> Even in Rust. If you can't imagine doing what a crate does, you are going down the wrong path
16:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah u can not use a crate
16:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> like in C
16:15 < bridge> <learath2> Fwiw C proobably is the most widely supported
16:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can be like in C and not use any deps
16:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> rewrite everything
16:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> reinvent the wheel
16:16 < bridge> <learath2> Gcc has backends for some of the weirdest chips
16:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i know
16:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw some of these odd chip compilers are buggy
16:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> anyway somehow it irks me the way he says it
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> I'm a firm believer in reinventing the wheel. It's a very important skill
16:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also agree its a good skill
16:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> which u can do in rust too
16:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wrote my own hashmap
16:17 < bridge> <learath2> That's how people feel when the Rust cops roll around üòÑ
16:18 < bridge> <learath2> Zealots will always be annoying no matter what they preach
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> but the difference is that these twits are followed by fresh newgrads who only know C from university
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> and think its all the world
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> well its twitter
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> i prefer reddit
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 btw there are also lot of consipiracy theories
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> that the US gov is behind rust
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> and some weird spy shit
16:19 < bridge> <learath2> If you can't write your own hashmap in your language of choice, you have made a very big mistake in some step of your education
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> cuz they made the memory safety announcement
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:20 < bridge> <learath2> I bet the NSA has backdoors in rustls
16:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
16:21 < bridge> <learath2> Nice to see someone that enjoys C though
16:22 < bridge> <learath2> Finally someone who has an appreciation for the dark arts
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ffmpeg is nice
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ppl dont know but its what powers video/audio encoding
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> of the world
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess all apps are just ffmpeg wrappers
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u think adobe uses ffmpeg
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is why it should be agpl-3
16:24 < bridge> <learath2> Adobe has their own thing
16:24 < bridge> <learath2> Adobe Media Encoder
16:25 < bridge> <learath2> They use some proprietary licensed implementation of h264
16:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
16:32 < bridge> <aegisub> premiere pro does use avcodec and avutil to some extent (that is, I see the dlls in the install) but not to actually encode their video
16:32 < bridge> <aegisub> for h264 it uses mainconcept
17:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://twitter.com/TheSnipingSnake/status/1771972086874927159
18:31 < bridge> <0xdeen> @comrade.one Is that you? ^ Thanks!
18:32 < bridge> <comrade.one> yes and no problem, you do a great stuff here
18:33 < bridge> <0xdeen> Huge donation!
18:33 < bridge> <teero777> how do they not have it protected against that?
18:33 < bridge> <teero777> isnt it a matter of putting up some aluminium foil? xD
18:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> @teero777 i think ecc ram makes this way less likely
18:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> but gamer pc usually dont use ecc ram iirc
19:00 < bridge> <learath2> All the way around, with no gaps
19:03 < bridge> <learath2> A real faraday cage is imperfect, it'll let through some frequencies (higher ones) and cosmic rays like these have enough energy at those frequencies to get through most commercial device EMF shielding
19:11 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, it can correct a single bit flip which is usually the case with this kind of random high energy interference
21:38 < bridge> <pilonpl> what does `"is_player":false` mean?
21:39 < bridge> <learath2> isbor
21:39 < bridge> <pilonpl> that the player is connect to the server but is in spectators?
21:39 < bridge> <learath2> isbot
21:39 < bridge> <pilonpl> what
21:39 < bridge> <learath2> nono it is spectator indeed
21:39 < bridge> <pilonpl> ok
21:39 < bridge> <pilonpl> thx
22:02 < bridge> <ar1gin> Sup devs, could someone hint me how to build a steam version of DDNet please? I am trying to replace steam DDNet binary with the modded one so I can still track the hours but I can't get it to launch. This is the error it gives me

22:32 < bridge> <ar1gin> It turns out that `cmake ..` is not the same as `cmake ..` in an empty build directory for some reason...? Problem fixed I guess
23:07 < bridge> <bumm.> @chairn ^
23:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> mind elaborating? im interested :D
23:10 < bridge> <ar1gin> Nothing special really, I just nuked the build folder and ran commands again as opposed to my usual workflow (just rerun them without cleaning build directory) and the problem disappeared
23:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah - i've never ran into that problem :o - i wonder why that happens
