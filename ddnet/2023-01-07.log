09:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> man, the serverbrowser looks so sexy without a scrollbar
09:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1061198657443074118/image.png
09:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> somehow much more modern
09:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> for some reason in the past weeks i often had this bug in github
09:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1061199844229779496/image.png
10:12 <+bridge> <murpi> Smooth scrolling in server browser &  using vulkan 1.1.0 is killing my FPS the longer I scroll
10:14 <+bridge> <murpi> IPv6 addresses in the server info box in Esc -> Server info is clipping into the game info box
10:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> some neat memory leak
10:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> indeed laggs hard when scrolling in debug mode ðŸ˜„
10:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but as soon as it stops its over for me
10:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it looks like it reuploads something. at least the staging buffer always increases for 1-2 frames
10:19 <+bridge> <murpi> @Robyt3 Thanks for copy info box :)
10:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Robyt3 does the new scrollbar update the CUIRect of the rows and did the only scrollbar not do this?
10:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i see most time is spent in rebuilding the serverbrowser text
10:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> while scrolling
10:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1061221146239971338/image.png

10:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i guess as long as width and height of the rects stays the same, we could just move the text call with the in built offset instead of rebuilding it based on x,y changes
10:55 <+bridge> <Robyt3> The FPS drop while scrolling is basically the same before and after if you scroll continuously for me, but now the FPS drop for the entire duration of the smooth scroll
10:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah i see
10:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but just to be sure, it's because the ui rect changes all the time?
10:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the coordinates
10:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```c++
10:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª>     virtual void RenderTextContainer(int TextContainerIndex, const ColorRGBA &TextColor, const ColorRGBA &TextOutlineColor, float X, float Y) = 0;
10:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ```
10:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
10:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> we have a rendertextcontainer that supports offsets
10:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so this might be fixable easy
10:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah
10:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i think i fixed it
10:59 <+bridge> <Robyt3> yeah, the UI rect position y changes whiles scrolling
11:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6249/commits/3a52ad861119e5a7e758f1b309775fe0f8042353
11:03 <+bridge> <Robyt3> nice, now there is almost no FPS drop while scrolling
11:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> its also useful for `CUIElement::SUIElementRect::Draw`
11:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but if i am not blind it's dead code as of now... but i cannot remember where it was used in the past ðŸ˜„
11:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @Robyt3 maybe u remember it ðŸ˜„
12:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> could this be used to codesign the fat binaries for macos? https://github.com/indygreg/apple-platform-rs/tree/f69ad3207e9a4898e338fbf1a2b24b9985fb5a03/apple-codesign
16:12 <+bridge> <Chairn> how come clang-tidy doesn't catch this as a useless store?

16:17 <+bridge> <Robyt3> I guess it doesn't look into the `SetHookedPlayer` function, so it has to assume that the function could have changed `m_HookState`
18:05 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ``` Unknown sequence number while processing queue
18:05 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7>  You called XInitThreads, this is not your fault

18:06 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> correct channel was #bugs
18:52 <+bridge> <Izanagi> who added the smooth scrolling in the server browser? it's very nice!
19:15 <+bridge> <Chairn> Robyt did
