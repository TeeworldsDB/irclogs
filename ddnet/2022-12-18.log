04:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> okay, something really weird is happening with the client on the map artic festivity. It looks like the client is trying to open some weird Windows setting
04:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i can't reproduce it, but i do have a black screen for a few frames when joining the map
04:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ive seen a windows saying if i want to open an unsecured "page"
04:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it seems to happen just before it transfers data to GPU
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and a good news for us i hope

09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Look in the logs. I guess you run out of memory and it tries to clean all staging buffers
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnetjs
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :pepeW: DDNet using 1.5G ram, what have we come to?
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Chromium port soon
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> lmao 1.5gb is nothing
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> terraria uses 700mb just in the main menu
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ^ summary
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there are webkit abstractions without js, future gonna be fun
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> html + css without js bloat. if it then uses 400mb, that's well spent 400MBs
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Terraria is made in C# ðŸ˜›
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, no need to discuss this, I know you and I fundamentally disagree on this, we talked about it enough ðŸ˜„
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway, these RAM values in ddnet are spent for performance
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its not like i initialize a VM that is used to render a website
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i know all devs here prefer to have 100mb tw that always streams all shit and runs at 60fps capped
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i prefer 2023 software. if rusticans get to a point where u can use rust instead of js, then i see a bright future for GUI frameworks. and if the renderer needs a cache of 1-2gb that so be it
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yay, can only have a couple of apps open in total
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm grateful that apps use all available memory
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just get a new computer?
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes exactly
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> most ppl use 16GB ram
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just accept it
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also don't be poor?
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Or download more ram, i did it and it worked
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> No cap
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sounds sane too
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Give link
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> ~~Hold on lemme find one that crashes your pc~~
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> :justatest:
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah steam hardware surveys, the only place where i feel accepted
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1054001934564085810/image.png
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 16gb RAM 50% of all users
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 8gb VRAM most users
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is 50% compatibility acceptable for you? ðŸ˜„
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 32 GB13.38%
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its 16gb or more
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜‰
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 32 GB 13.38%
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a quarter have 8gb or less
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well i guess u know what u buy this christmas then
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let's make the next version use 8gb ram in the menu for 5 extra fps
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkaS:
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i can also do that with less RAM, but u dont understand it
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs only thing u can say is that RAM is so bad
12:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No use more. Why use less when more available?
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If not enough users can always buy more
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats your whole point of life, saying that an app should not use lot of RAM
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> PS1 had like 2MB ram. it loaded the shit from CD
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Our player base will have worse systems than players playing AAA games on Steam
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if u prefer to load all stuff from CD go ahead
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and so what? do u think someone has only 500mb RAM?
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> You just don't need 300k fps performance
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You do
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's a difference between 16 gb ram and the 500 MB you now proposed
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Why?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes ddnet doesnt use 16GB ram if u didnt notice yet
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, DDNet isn't the only thing running
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> except u load some 16k textures
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's still usually an OS and a browser
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I render directly onto reality. Need as close to continuous time as possible
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's QoL to be able to run DDNet concurrent with other apps
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats why 99,99% of all users have at least 4GB ram
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so u can run browser and ddnet
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't think you can do that
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with 4 GB
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and DDNet taking 2 GB
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And if you also want to listen to music, you are shit out of luck? ðŸ˜›
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but learath wants to compile, play ddnet, play crysis and all at 100MB
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, you're misrepresenting @Jupeyy_Keks
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> where does ddnet take 2gb?
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I played csgo, had browser opened, Spotify, discord, screen share and ddnet running on my old pc at the same time :justatest:
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> deen in the issue said, after loading ddnet uses 1GB RAM
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on one of the biggest maps out there
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > DDNet using 1.5G ram, what have we come to?
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> during startup for a short moment
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes temporarily
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You can try checking the massif file, I'm not sure if we can get the memory usage more stable
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not super high prio if this issue was caused by 4k skins anyway
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ddnet uses these RAM values since 2017 btw
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it was introduced with opengl 3.3
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, but this large maps haven't been so popular
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so in future this gets less problem xd
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Cloud based ram soonTM
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Literally just wanted to point out that we took a game that ran comfortably on a coffee maker and now there are computers that crash trying to load maps. Nothing else
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and now u have 15k FPS, almost perfect frame times
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Didn't really want to have a discussion about it. Just a sidenote
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh yeah sure
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u posted it just as a sidenote for yourself
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought it was funny. I pointed it out. Is that not allowed?
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just because we disagree doesn't mean I do everything just to poke at you
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its funny that u dont use ddnet 9.x
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> where the world was still without problems
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ugly map res that isnt pixel perfect. skins that are not allowed to be high res
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> keeping your unstable 60fps
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we are still compatible to ddnet 9.x
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd take that chance if i'd be u
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Why would you need so much ðŸ˜­
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u have to understand one thing about FPS
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> more FPS = more STABLE frametimes
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so u should read it like this:
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - it uses less CPU
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - it can use more CPU total => more FPS
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - if you cap it it uses less CPU than before while still being more stable frame time wise
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u have to understand one thing about FPS
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> more FPS = more STABLE frametimes (in the sense of ddnet)
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so u should read it like this:
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - it uses less CPU
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - it can use more CPU total => more FPS
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - if you cap it it uses less CPU than before while still being more stable frame time wise
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so yes, if i could reach 200k FPS with 1gb more VRAM or RAM, i'd instantly do it
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool, it'd probably stop running on my computer soon, then
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I understand about stable fps, kinda, but i usually limit my fps to my monitor refresh rate multiplied by 2 or 3, 20x is just too much, isnt it?:justatest:
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bad for you, but i have good knows. even if u could still improve it a bit, there is not lot of headroom anymore for now
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe in 10years there is new hardware with new ideas to improve it
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bad for you, but i have good news. even if u could still improve it a bit, there is not lot of headroom anymore for now
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I find your attitude really out of place
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> your attitude makes ddnet stay compatible with dated stuff forever
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it's really bad to tell your users: you're too poor to run ddnet
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i find my attitude more sane
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need to upgrade your computer
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's really bad IMO
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dude, u literally talking shit
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> there is not a SINGLE computer i dropped support for
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not ONE computer
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hey, stop telling me I'm talking shit
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i even gave workarounds for ppl that literally have NO OPENGL driver
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not okay
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> hey but u are
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> timeout
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :justatest:
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This conversation always gets way too heated
14:19 <+ChillerDragon> A: buse
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Was the shotgun velocity bug already known/reported?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> (if you are inside another tee and shoot with your shotgun, the other tee gets infinite velocity
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> seems like negative infinity to be precise
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> This is easy to test on Arctic Festivity
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> One or both tees need tee collision disabled and one needs the shotgun powerup on the map
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> at least one tee needs tee collision disabled and one needs the shotgun powerup on the map
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> not a bug but a feature ðŸ¥¹
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> this bug exist since the universe was created
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kicker> Its a feature ye :justatest:
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> Why must this be a feature though :|
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I guess on many maps it wouldn't be an issue, but it is game breaking for maps with open ceilings
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> I have seen multiple people die today because of that feature
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> I guess it's a part of the game now, can't be removed
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 2022-12-18 04:09:48 I vulkan: vulkan memory allocation failed, trying to recover.
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> but how the hell can it trigger opening a "page" (still don't know what it is, the window i saw was on only for a second)
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> sry dunno what a page is, it renders a black screen once bcs it frees memory from another frame
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> can you make it possible to mark multiple demos at one? with shift+ left click like on windows
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> or crtl+left click
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> can you make it possible to mark multiple demos at once? with shift+ left click like on windows
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> whats ur use case? ðŸ˜„
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it is even used in some maps
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> okay, i removed all the non 256x128 skins
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i guess it should already hel
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i guess it should already help
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i had around 20 of them, including some weird resolution like 15yy x 7yy
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as long as the client doesnt close it should be fine tho
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its simply bcs of staging buffers whose lifetime might exceed one frame bcs its not clear how long the driver needs them
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so as soon as the frame is free to use again they can be freed
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can you maybe screen the "page" thing
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i wonder what exactly that is. does windows try to allocate read only memory or what? XD
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it happend only once, with black screen for more than a second
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but only during loading right?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it looked like a windows with a gear wheel icon
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yes
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> as if the window hangs?
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno what gear wheel icon is in windows 7
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> easier to delete demos if i have 200 with 0 demo markers in it
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> or copy them and put them into a new folder
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i see, yeah would be cool for that case indeed
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Shyzo> +
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i tried to search on google, didn't find anything alike
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> rest in peace goofy ahh zoom snapping..
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> How did 'unranked' become `null`?

21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> someone smarter will answer :p
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> deen when are u gonna make docs for the api :kekw:
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Please comment if you have better texts for the tooltips
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sans> if a player doesn't have any points at all, are they even added to the database, and therefore available in the API?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yes if they finished a 0 point map
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> otherwise, no, how would the database know of their existence?
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Devinci> create a database with all possible combinations of characters ðŸ‘Œ
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Library of babel
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> best
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://libraryofbabel.info/
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> relevant https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDrBIKOR01c
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> wtf is this?
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> looks like page of random letters
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you dont know
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what the library of babel is?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > By this art you may contemplate the variation of the 23 letters.
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://libraryofbabel.info/About.html
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > The Library of Babel is a place for scholars to do research, for artists and writers to seek inspiration, for anyone with curiosity or a sense of humor to reflect on the weirdness of existence - in short, itâ€™s just like any other library. If completed, it would contain every possible combination of 1,312,000 characters, including lower case letters, space, comma, and period. Thus, it would contain every book that ever has been written, 
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it contains all possible texts
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there will be
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or ever been
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or can be
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in the 23 letter alphabet
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> infinite knowledge
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it contains the world formula
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this video is epic
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> watch it
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> near the end it talks about babel
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?test:972
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> nvm that wont work
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to who posted
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> why can i not send a direct link
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it works
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> oh
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just gotta wait a lil
23:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to load

23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > "The Library of Babel" (Spanish: La biblioteca de Babel) is a short story by Argentine author and librarian Jorge Luis Borges (1899â€“1986), conceiving of a universe in the form of a vast library containing all possible 410-page books of a certain format and character set.
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from spain
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > W.Â V.Â O. Quine notes that the Library of Babel is finite, and that any text that does not fit in a single book can be reconstructed by finding a second book with the continuation. The size of the alphabet can be reduced by using Morse code even though it makes the books more verbose; the size of the books can also be reduced by splitting each into multiple volumes and discarding the duplicates. Writes Quine, "The ultimate absurdity is n
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> interesting
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> morse code has a third letter, "pause"

23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk about that

23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but maybe ambiguous here is nice
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u are encoded 2 in 1?
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> encoding*
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Somebody know if courses from cppcon.org are recorded and available to watch?:justatest:
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd say here
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://www.youtube.com/@CppCon/videos
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or are they courses in the sense of getting to learn cpp?^^

23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Well, i found this thing
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> https://cppcon.org/applied-modern-cpp/
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Which has no link to actual materials ðŸ¥º
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i c++
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i used cppreference to learn most c++20 language features
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and for standard library forget to learn everything xdd
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its so huge
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmm, josh triplett is some rust guy
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> That couse was mentioned in another article as good example of modern c++, so i just was curious
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> "(immediately after the conference)."
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so i guess its not public ðŸ˜„
