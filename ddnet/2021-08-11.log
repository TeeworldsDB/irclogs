01:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3960
02:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cool changes
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª #4003 works but it looks wrong
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4003
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can you specify or send screen?
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh actually gl3 and gl2 both look wrong, only gl1 looks correct
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜®
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> gl1
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/874912488263655454/Screenshot_2021-08-11_at_10.09.09.png
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> gl2/3
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/874912533872525312/Screenshot_2021-08-11_at_10.09.35.png
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the missing quad on the top also makes the animations look very weird
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and thats since the patch?
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> causes these weird corners etc.
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/874912758062284860/Screenshot_2021-08-11_at_10.10.32.png
09:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will check
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> gl3.3 looks correct, gl3 and gl2 were broken before 4003 anyway. So I guess it's not related to the patch
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> still weird
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> quads use triangles
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> directly
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can you see how the HLS color sliders look like in tee settings?
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they also use triangles
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me run my janky debug build in case we have unhandled gl errors still
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> too bad nobody cares about older GL anymore, makes it just harder to find such errors
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> sliders seem fine
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/874914212659486760/Screenshot_2021-08-11_at_10.16.26.png
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> really weird xD
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe the texture binding somehow fails
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, no such luck this time
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So unless there are gl calls outside backend_opengl your gl calls succeed
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mh yeah, and the map triangles also use the gl 1.x method of rendering them
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe some z-ordering issue? my settings screenshot sort of suggests the quad is still there just behind the others
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> depth buffer shouldnt be active, so first come first rendered
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe the render order is wrong?
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why shouldnt it reproducable in other contexts then ðŸ˜„
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> true, so that's not it
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wait
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> are they even quads
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> im not even that sure
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I haven't checked
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they are tiles
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in fact we only see quads
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> normally quad rendering is checked
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> can you try
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gfx_3d_texture_analysis_done 0
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and restart
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe your config is in some invalid state
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> okay, it decided gl1.5 is the best idea
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so the fallback works?
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i wonder how it passed the fallback thing, can basically only happen if you copy config or change hardware, or the driver gets a nice downgrade
09:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now all the versions work, so weird, I guess I had a broken config somehow
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah it doesnt allow u to use gl 2.x anymore
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it just downgrades the GL version
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk why it decided on 1.5 either, 3.3 works fine on macOS, even better
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah strange
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gl 2.1+ - 3.0 work with extensions
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, it won't let me have a 2.1 context anymore, it will indeed fall back to 1.5
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe they are wrongly implemented and gl 3.3 just has it as core feature
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats why this
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it somehow passed it before, dunno how, almost impossible without a change
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And if I request a major 3 context it will properly choose 3.3 now, it used to pick 3.0 iirc
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah bcs minor is set to 5
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs it chooses 1.5
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, I was testing around many different versions/commits it is possible the config broke along the way
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe we should just remove these stupid broken GL versions and default to GL 3.3 and remove the texture unit optimization stuff so it won't break on some systems
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> with gl 3.3 we have more debugging too
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> renderdoc for example
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh, quite impossible we have to atleast keep gl1 support because broken drivers
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gl 1.x and 3.3
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but no inbetween
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (or we are doing something wrong because I still think it's insane that we can't render a 2d game in 2021 ðŸ˜„ )
09:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i play with gl 3.3 since 4 years, all bugs we had were fixed
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why did we introduce the gl2 stuff anyway?
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mipmaps
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Don't we still have that intel issue?
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for example yes
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they would then get gl 1.x
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> which is slower than 2.0
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> annoying af
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and iirc our gl1 backend is just flat out inferior, can't zoom out far even, no?
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but gl 2.0 isnt much better
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 2.0 is basically vanilla 0.7 just a little bit different
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so it uses 3d textures, instead of 2d array textures, thus no mipmaps
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and iirc it also doesnt use VBOs
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I don't even remember what the initial issue was that required the hack of using 3d textures on vanilla
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do you know the border tools?
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they remove some pixels from the tile set images, bcs the UV coordinates aren't correctly calculated with mipmaps
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> e.g. 1/1024 is less than 1/512
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so if you get the 512 mipmap the coordinate is wrong
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the problem on vanilla is, it's not worth it
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah the old borderfix mess
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 3d textures don't have mipmaps
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well not completly worthless tho tbf
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it still clamps the edges correctly
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but e.g. zoom in the vanilla 0.7 editor on Multimap(the original one)
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and do the same with gl 3.3 on our edtior
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then you see why ddnet's version is supirior
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How does the gl33 renderer handle the old borderfixed tilesets?
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they arent fixed, the mapres will look 2 pixels streetched if u zoom in very much
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but vanilla res for example isnt saved in the map
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so its not alot of maps where you will notice it
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, and the gl1 renderer? I assume that looks correct
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (for borderfixed tilesets)
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhhhhhh
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you could say it looks more correct
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but the math is still wrong
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only if you get the correct mipmap?
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> gl 1.x doesnt have mipmaps anymore
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we could probably calculate the texel offset for that context too, but i assume only few ppl use 1.x and they probs have a poor resolution anyway to notice
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So Q: can't one disable mipmaps? Why did vanilla go with 3d textures if so?
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont get your first question
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for the second:
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs 3d textures exists since gl 1.2
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and 2d array textures are core since 3.0( and over extension for gl 1.2)
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dont get your first question
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for the second:
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs 3d textures exists since gl 1.2
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and 2d array textures are core since 3.0( and over extension for gl 2.1)
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> vanilla doesnt want modern things xd
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u can disable it by using gl 2.0 and lower, or maybe in ur driver, but else no
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I thought borderfix was needed to accomodate for mipmaps
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it was needed bcs the texel offset math in gl 1.x context is random
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you could say:
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it works for most cases, bcs most ppl have a resolution of something that only chooses a mipmap of 512x512pixels or more
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> i think sdl 2.0.16 broke wayland backend on wlroots
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> basically you can imagine it as, just adding an offset of 1/512
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so if you have low res screen it looks ok
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and on higher res it will remove too much from the texture, but the bordertool streetches these pixels, so in the end it looks fine too
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but removing 4 pixels of a 64 pixels tile is quite alot
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> rip, have you reported it?
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª do u use wayland
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but bcs its streetched it looks worse on lower res with boridertools.. thus random xd
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not rn, bcs i dont want forced vsync
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i'd use it, once its stable
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so maybe 1-2 years
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i hear they are obsessed with real fps or smth
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know the word rn
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the performance is really nice
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everyone these days is using meson instead of cmake
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i get more fps, KDE's compositor doesnt destroy my fps too
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> quite an improvement
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i don't even get why xd
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/65
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/874924542005497866/unknown.png
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they want it "frame perfecT"
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah xD
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he probs doesnt play games
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> rule number one
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if a gamer wants smth, they want it xD
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> games are for kids tho
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/874924849309569024/unknown.png
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nori> @Jupstar âœª found the pr that cause it, i'll report
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I sort of agree that tearing doesn't help much, but you leet gamers are very passionate about it and I've promised myself I won't get mad this month
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it makes insane difference xD
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for ddmax maps it might not matter
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but as soon as you have more action it it, rip
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> for ddmax maps it might not matter
10:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but as soon as you have more action in it, rip
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've been playing games almost as long as you and I've almost always played with vsync, there is a difference but calling it insane is a bit overreaching
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i get if you'd play on my setup you would never want to go back to another xD
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bet*
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway, wayland shouldn't be the one enforcing this, I agree on that
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> my brother even uses 144hz just for desktop xD
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> scrolling etc just smoother
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mobile phones also get 120hz screen nowadays
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean I played on many setups over the years, starting from a janky old crt tv all the way to a 4k 144hz monitor
10:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe vsync will work with 1000hz screens xd
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 60hz to 144hz is indeed a large change, but go back to 60hz and you'll forget about the jerkiness in a matter of days
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 60hz is nice, it made me not playing teeworlds in my holidays anymore
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (unless you obsess about it, then it will stay there forever, the brain is good at making the motion continuous, but if you keep looking for the gap it can't do it's job)
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i am obsess with such stuff
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, at 144hz vsync is even better for me
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if there would be an OS with lto and Ofast
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd use it for the 5-10% performance uplift xD
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/world/europe/germany-covid-test.html
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can compile most everything with Ofast and LTO on gentoo, I used such a system for a long time
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah i dont want to compile myself
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sort of gave up on it tho since LTO was very immature back when I was using it
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> takes too much time
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but yeah generally i like the idea
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Doesn't, unless you use a toaster. The initial setup is longer but after that modern compilers and linkers are quite fast
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i want to switch to gentoo so badly but im too lazy to redo my setup
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i have accumulated lot of files
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont know which are important
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I even had distcc setup so I could compile packages on my desktop for my laptop ðŸ˜›
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well i sometimes compile KDE, takes ages
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe if i'd use a home server, so it doesnt block my main setup
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lucky me i use a wm compiling that is probs way faster
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well next debian finally enables lto, thats already a nice step forward
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why have a desktop when rofi/dmenu is all u need
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> arch probably already has quite alot lto packages i assume?
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/davatorium/rofi
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i remember we had an compiler bug once, that destroyed the arch package, i could reprod with lto
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Have you tried the muqss patchset? I compile in the background all the time and my system stays fairly responsive
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you only compile packages from AUR
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah AUR is the thing
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder how much more speed native arch compilation gives u
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> -march=native
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> never heard of it ðŸ˜„
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª what distro u use
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think ck-sources includes the patch
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah thats the next step, an OS for AMD CPUs xD
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> debian unstable
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mostly bcs i hate when KDE is buggy xD
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and its basically always buggy
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª im surprised AAA games dont give out binaries with amd/intel cpu simd stuff
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ikr
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> especially on steam it shouldnt be so hard
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/874928141129383996/unknown.png
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stockfish does it
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are years ahead
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe steam allows it, dunno, i dont have a dev account there
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably not much at all
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if i made a game i would add it as a custom version
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> beta
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> steam probs allows it that way
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://openbenchmarking.org/embed.php?i=2106164-IB-CLANGOPTI18&sha=461cf373e986&p=2
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> on clang 12
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> o3 lto is slower
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> than o3
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> except for openmp clang is also often faster than gcc, thats also a nice battle
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah really weird
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think phoronix also has benchmarks showing that O3 didnt change anything over the last 10 years xD
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so sad
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> performance wise
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The linux kernel also fares better on gcc still iirc.
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah possibly
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> still i wonder why gcc almost didnt improve, are the tricks over, or is it bcs gcc fears to break stuff or smth
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So what do you want to do about #4003 @Jupstar âœª?
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4003
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just merge i guess, it won't break anything, still better than having it wrong
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `GL_COPY_WRITE_BUFFER`
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> So made for copy and writing
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but we only bind one buffer at a time in <gl 3.0  context
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so should be fine
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Learath2 
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/commit/3b5eddbe4607f342c8931ff8601eb33220bf6434
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> This checks glError after every opengl call, and also checks the current attached shader for correct runtime(e.g. missing texture etc.)
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> If you want you could try to use it with GL 2.1(u gotta enable gfx_3d_texture_analysis_done 1 for that again)
11:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Maybe it shows why it cant render tile sets
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh and its only in debug mode
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Yousry> c
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª I had a very similar patch, I checked the error log after each command and didn't find anything
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> k
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TT_Kaz> free node is wher
13:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TT_Kaz> free node is where
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can someone remove this from being counted as worse time on ddnet
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/875052493854375947/unknown.png
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its on Puzzle Partners, it has a 15min time penalty u can spam
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> u
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.dev/ddnet/ddnet
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont need ur editor anymore
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just press "." on any github repo
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it opens this editor
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> is that new?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> if yes its suprisingly late considering how long ago ms bought github and gitlab already had a more solid IDE right? I mean wasnt vscode developed as web app and then later "ported" to desktop
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> why is is white themed \:D
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont see it white themed
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ddnet client white theme when
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Ryozuki\:  do u use dark themed github?=
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> y
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> like everybody except chiller xD
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I used light github while working outside the last week
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also use a light themed ide when out, it's actually fairly hard to see when the sun is out, we sort of forget how insanely overwhelming the sun can be compared to our puny indoor lighting ðŸ˜›
