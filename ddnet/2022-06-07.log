07:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beautemps> Hello people, Idk if I'm in the right section to ask this question. Maybe you can answer it or redirect me?
07:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beautemps> 
07:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Beautemps> I've recorded a demo of a game moment on an existing map that I'd like to change the design but the file.demo seems to already include the map I am trying to replace. Is it possible to edit it?
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yes you have to edit the demo file itself
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think @plsplsplslol did it
07:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> u
07:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea possible. I also saw them glitch into the master server sometimes. Something must have borked after a merge with ddnet I guess. Just have been too lazy to look into it yet
07:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@heinrich5991)
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Fixed. But yea I‚Äôm barley commenting or watching these days

14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> Crazy coincidence, I'm barley too
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga Can your map testing script check that people are using time checkpoints on their maps? We want them on all maps for speedrunning: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yMMBLSbS2cOSYsbIMkDZpMLaV6k930mXj5yVZF0Uuaw/edit#gid=0

18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> had a similar script, adjusted it and it seems to work :)
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/983777026878095360/check_for_tile_range.py
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> should we maybe force a specific count of Time CP, so that there is not only one xD
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <destroyed230> MIcrosux or Linuxosft?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @deen oh I misunderstood, you were asking about the discord bot integration. the biggest question there is how you want to tell the script that it is a speedrun map. currently every map is just handled the same, without even differentiating between categories like dummy/fun
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> else I would've also already included a check whether there is a start and finish tile, but some fun maps don't have those I think (maybe should've done it still)
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah the script is a bit wrong, coz the tiles consist of the id byte and the flag byte, it should just check the id byte
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/983791185468489808/check_for_tile_range.py
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it wouldn't produce wrong results in this case, but here is the correct version anyways
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> All maps should have then, as far as I understand. But it could be only a warning for fun maps.
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kl0rexx> yoo, back in the days i tried something with ddnet, and i really trying something again, but my cmake is giving me errors, i know and i readed the errors, but i dont know where to download these things, can somebody help me? ^^
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <kl0rexx> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/983793886696702022/unknown.png
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> See <https://ddnet.tw/tiles/CHECKPOINT_FIRST/ https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/pull/57/files> ... they try to add it on all maps
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> See <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yMMBLSbS2cOSYsbIMkDZpMLaV6k930mXj5yVZF0Uuaw/> ... they try to add it on all maps
20:06 <+ChillerDragon> need an incomplete list with checkpoint count, map name? xd https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/tH
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> would be better if you count how many diffrent time checkpoints are used (out of the 25) instead of counting the tiles
20:08 <+ChillerDragon> tru
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh true, for some reason my brain failed to parse deen's message twice o.o
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> every map should have time checkpoints now, for speedrunning
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and yes, for the official map release pipeline
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't know how it works and who to contact for that üòÑ
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just thought you wrote some checking script that we are using there
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> MAybe the function to parse Deene messages has a bug. Raise issue on github.
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> MAybe the function to parse Deen messages has a bug. Raise issue on github.
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> alright yea :) . the only question mark for me is if having some fun-category maps trigger the warning is fine
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> I guess I should just ask the testers for that
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> fun maps don't need time cps
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we also ignore them for #records , they are not relevant for speedrunning
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> alright, I'll try to figure something out on where it should differentiate fun and non-fun maps
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if it's not possible, that's also not too bad
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> okay üëç
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> git submodule init --recursive
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> and call cmake with -DPREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON
21:36 <+ChillerDragon> custom icons on linux are too hard for me :( either i get none, broken or ddnet icon xd https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1654630527.png
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> have you updated the icon cache xD
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Idk how to so I just rebooted my pc haha
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> But I think it‚Äôs updating pretty fast automatically as far as I can tell from the working ddnet icon
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Dragonwood> [suggestion] save the demo of the top1 team run of a map serversided and make it playable for all players on request - it would be so good to see, what the rank 1 did differently w/0 having to rely on replays on yt, which arent available for all maps
