15:52 < needs1> I'm trying to understand how extended connless packets works with vanilla client: it seems like an extended connless packet should start with 'x', 'e' and four additional byte, where a vanilla connless packet starts with six 0xff byte.  Uppon receiving a packet, the vanilla client check the second bit to know if the packet is connless or not.  Or extended packets starts with 'x' and 'x' in binary is 01111000, hence the second bit is 0.  S
15:52 < needs1> o vanilla client should not treats extended packets as connless packets in the first place.  How can this works then?
15:54 < needs1> I'm talking about this piece of code: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/shared/network.cpp#L95
16:05 < needs1> Oh OK, I see: vnilla client checks the 6th bit, not the 2nd one, my bad
