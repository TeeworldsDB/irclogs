13:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> What about to make fucking moving freeze?
14:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> What about to implement moving tiles instead just like gores did
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @uwu kog already has moving freeze
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a lot more that I want to get out of the way before we start adding new gameplay features
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> ерфе лщп
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> thats kog
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> what about ddnet
16:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> servers
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @uwu there is a lot more that should be to get out od the way before we start adding new features
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Hmmm
18:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> For example?
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> @uwu there is a lot more that should done before we start adding new features
18:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> @n000b i saw u was typing...
18:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Well look at the pull requests and issues on github. Besides
18:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Well look at the pull requests and issues on github. Besides there are some other projects which are not shown there
18:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Learath wanted to change something with the ddnetnmasterserver to prevent ddos for example and he was trying to get a good solution for implementing accounts if i am right.
19:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not to forget the update to 0.7 🙂
19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> True
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> I want to give an stupid idea
19:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Change masterservers ips
19:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :monkaS: **he's too dangerious to be kept alive**
19:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> btw no matter if you change the ip's, ddosers will ddos that specific ip too
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> 😮
19:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> ban ips that will sent too muck packages
21:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @uwu attacker forges the udp packets so that the source ip is fake or from another legit player who did nothing wrong
21:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Hmmm
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> What about sell this servers and buys servers with ddos protection?
21:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> What about sell this servers and buy servers with ddos protection?
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> it doesnt work like that
21:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> theres nothing u can pay for that would possibly protect tw
21:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> https://aws.amazon.com/ru/shield/ddos-attack-protection/ eeeeeh
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Cant find us site :oop:
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> cyka
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> and no
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> u dont get it
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> because of the way teeworlds netcode is written, and the way its fundamentally structured
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> there is no possible way to just buy a server that allows an unmodified tw server to handle such large ddoseses without lag
21:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> it requires code fixes
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Fix the code?
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> :DD
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> its a better idea than throwing money at things u dont understand..
21:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> :c
21:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Ehh
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> In which file net code? :V
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> network_server.cpp, network.cpp, server.cpp
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> and system.c
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Oh yes
21:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Its cpp
21:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i dont claim to have the solutions for ddos, im slowly fixing my own server by editing mostly these files, but im sure a smarter person could do a better job with it
21:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i just know that paying more isnt really the solution
21:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> these servers can easily receive all the ddos data without any lag
21:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> it only lags when trying to reply to everything
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Umm :sorry: but where are that files, in what folder (im looking on github)
21:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> src/engine/shared/ for the first three and src/base/ for system.c
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Thx
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> er
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> src/engine/server for server.cpp
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> src/engine/shared for the first two***
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Ok
21:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> gl 😄
21:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> Thx :D
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well, technically you could throw the money at a developer to fix it up 😛
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> learath pls fix my server
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only I had the time and motivation for it
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> onby pls host server 20$ / month
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> im already hosting
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> and wow that could buy us a 4x more expensive server
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> :v
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> not that 20$ would be expensive, but this is how much i would cash out with some irl support
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i mean
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> my sv costs $5/mon
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could get a more expensive server, but is that really the solution?
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i really dont think it is
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> no, but dont deny money
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> because if the server can receieve all that data without lag
21:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd just require one of us to get a living wage and sacrifice like 2-3 meals outside 😄
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> then it *should* be able to reply smoothly too
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> ye more money = more smoothness :feelsamazingman:
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well there are fundamental limitations
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> if there was too much incoming data to overwhelm the link then it wouldnt even be able to receive it all without lagging
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> the issue is not only server performance but also limitations on packets per second
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. the linux network stack itself can't really do much more then 50kpps per core without some extra work
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i mean when i run a server and let it receive all 200000 packets/sec of incoming junk, and use f2 to disable the replies to connect packets and inforeq packets, the server instantly stops lagging and anyone whos already connected can play smoothly like always
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> turning on the replies makes it lag when theres more than idk 100000pps
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 200kpps on a 5$/mon server?
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> mhm
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> How many vcores you get?
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> but only recv
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> 1 lololol
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i wish more
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> my threading code may be kinda useless otherwise
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's either some next level tuning on the kernel or the hypervisor
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> 
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/646447436105121821/Screen_Shot_2019-11-19_at_2.31.06_PM.png
21:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> it can receive all this without lag if i make it stop sending out SendControl for tken and replies to fstd/gie3
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> but since those things make the server hidden and stop people from connecting its not really a fix
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> just a possible lead towards a solution maybe
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I missed that you don't reply at all
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> yeah
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sorry, just woke up
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> the replies is the problem
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> lol
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, you can drop traffic a bit better then handling it
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> replying ofc means the you just double the pps count
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <redix> replying ofc means that you just double the pps count
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also recvmmsg is supposed to be helpful with this kinda thing
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> ddnet changed recv to recvmms
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> yeah
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> could we use the equivalent for sending
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think it'd be very useful anyway
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn't show up in profiling
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> thats a good sign isnt it
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> or u mean, the sending
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> 
21:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/646448337276633138/Screen_Shot_2019-11-19_at_2.34.46_PM.png
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> The sending
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> some profiling output from when the server was receiving and trying to reply to all
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> threadrun is trying to reply to tkens
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> eh
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> i should do a profiling session without the experimental threading shit
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should also profile with callgrind
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> whats that
21:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Stack sampling while nice is not that accurate
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> ooooo
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Callgrind accurately profiles by dynamically rewriting the code
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> that looks cool
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> wtf xd
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not very performant
21:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But it is very accurate
21:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> And overhead per function is same so all the costs are inflated equally
21:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> (Except for very small costs that end up getting amplified)
21:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> thx ill try this
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> woooow this is cool
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> 
22:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <onby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/646460570626686985/Screen_Shot_2019-11-19_at_3.19.37_PM.png
