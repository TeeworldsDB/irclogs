02:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, gameworlds being handled by the gamecontroller turns out to be quite unwise :/
03:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki && @heinrich5991 can you both take a look at that commit? I'm not sure I like the organization with the worlds being owned by the controller
03:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (The commit works, but you need to modify the code to put tees in separate teams and initialize the world by hand in `CGameControllerDDRace` )
03:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also I had no idea how to handle the `m_Paused`
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also tried my very best not to touch the vanilla gamecontroller but I need to get rid of some of the team code and I don't really know how
03:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Vanilla really should have had a fully abstract `IGameController` ...
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 paused is the thing used in start of tournaments right?
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, so maybe a global paused is something i need to have
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 one thing i never liked is that character adds himself to the gameworld, and i think it would make more sense to be managed by the gameworld directly
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ala its the gameworld who respawns and adds the entity
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Not character itself
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It kinda breaks the hierarhy
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But its unrelsted to this tho
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Damn mobile
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki sadly all entities add themselves, I dont really think its a good idea to make so many changes just to get better hierarchy
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I guess
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :feelsbadman:
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe I can do it after I finish up the teams i can go through and change that
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Didnt u say 0.7 is the oportunity for big changes? üòè
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ill try to help too specially this weekend
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I wish github had a mobile app
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 your helper commit misses a lot of things
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably, not all commits are supposed to work on that branch, im still laying things out
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What did you have in mind?
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will do a pr after shower, you missed basic stuff to get the helper working in general
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> in case any1 is using windows and discord might be interesting: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/discord-turned-into-an-info-stealing-backdoor-by-new-malware/
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can log in as helper and there is a console level for helper, I dont see what's missing but sure feel free to pr
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> did you try logging in?
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, probably my mod again having more stuff so more required changes
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I can check later
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yo bash haxx0rs? How to compare against newline? :/
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/637246826717642753/unknown.png
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i can easily match the $c newline but not the $nl
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/637246909148299265/unknown.png
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh wait that code is fucked xd
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/637247145002401822/unknown.png
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats what i ment but it has same result
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nvm got it
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/637247665817780244/unknown.png
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> that works üôÇ
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u chiller
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, I missed the default key and setting the actual access level
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll accept the pr, but I hope you know that the code is open source, and all your contributions are also open source
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I know that
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why do you tell me that so explicitly? :)
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well you asked us not to host your version of the code, I'm just stating upfront that I won't be removing this branch under any condition
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We really should add a CONTRIBUTION file
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> You can do it. I messaged heinrich about that already
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> As I told you now too in pm, I thought about the whole situation
13:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I see
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And I definitely apologize for all that.
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I wouldnt make any pr's right now if I would still be against all this
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It happens
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sometimes people can just get on your nerves
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :/
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> true
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> about the md5 thing
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ü§°
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the function `md5_finish_` is actually called once, with the correct parameters. It just didnt get renamed and failed the build
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The md5 thing links fine on ddnet 0.6, and links fine on linux for me, but I'm using hash_openssl
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there are two different md5_finish's
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats the point
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hash_openssl is not used √≥n win (at least for me)
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, the bundled one looks wrong to me aswell
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no idea, but this change at least fixed the build
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, it is correct, I just missed it while porting the md5 implementation over
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I just took the name with the underscore from where it acutally gets called, there it is correct
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah, okay
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should commit the md5 thing to vanilla aswell
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean hash_bundled and using openssl if available
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I wanted to remove the last commit before merging those 2 prs
14:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can rebase, reorder anyway
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> also no need to bother with bors on d7 as I dont run it through ci yet anyway
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's more of a drawing board
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> did u mess with the git history? Should i refork? :/
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Were you messing around with d7?
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought no one else was doing anything with it, soz, I'll keep the history sane after this
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't refork, you can just `git reset --hard ddnet/d7` your own d7 branch, if you were working on some other branch you'll need to rebase it
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what is master and what is d7 used for?
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i think i only used master
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> d7 is a rewrite, master is fokkonauts port
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hi
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah i see
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so rewrite ddnet7 from scratch?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is d7 planned to replace master?
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Just make d7 the main one
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> default*
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it ever gets completed, yes that'll be the adopted version
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki do you like the CGameWorlds belonging to the gamecontroller?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 whats the alternative?
16:16 <+Ryozuki> thanks bouncer i got all irc configured fast, but im on fedora and i hate it
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> CGameContext owning the worlds maybe
16:17 <+Ryozuki> wait a bit i look d7 code
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I moved the team stuff to a branch of it's own, `fb_teams`
16:22 <+Ryozuki> i compiled d7
16:22 <+Ryozuki> idk if its fedora stuff but i see one of the things in the bg
16:22 <+Ryozuki> in 4 colors
16:22 <+Ryozuki> like the texture is missing
16:25 <+Ryozuki> https://imgur.com/mtrHPBU
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> welcome to 0.7 @Ryozuki üôÇ
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> just 0,7 things
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki did you clone the submodules aswell?
16:28 <+Ryozuki> oh
16:28 <+Ryozuki> xd
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nobo xd
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> wonder that it even compiles without submodules
16:28 <+Ryozuki> Learath2: itdoesnt make sense for worlds to be managed by controller i think
16:28 <+Ryozuki> to not be
16:28 <+Ryozuki> *
16:28 <+Ryozuki> ups
16:28 <+Ryozuki> i think
16:29 <+Ryozuki> IGameController::OnEntity(int Index, vec2 Pos, int Layer, int Flags, int Number)
16:29 <+Ryozuki> for example
16:29 <+Ryozuki> i think it makes sense for worlds to manage their own entities
16:29 <+Ryozuki> just like character shouldnt manage itself (inserting itself to the world)
16:29 <+Ryozuki> i think the current hierarchy is not good
16:31 <+Ryozuki> @ChillerDragon it compiles cuz apparently the submodules are just game resources not code
16:31 <+Ryozuki> hmm i still see the same texture stuff after git submodule update --init
16:32 <+Ryozuki> ill clean build
16:34 <+Ryozuki> ah my bad
16:34 <+Ryozuki> i was on master
16:34 <+Ryozuki> on d7 looks fine
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea the d7/master thing is a bit confusing :/
16:46 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 hmm maybe its fine with controller having the worlds
16:46 <+Ryozuki> but maybe we can move some stuff directly to the world class
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OnEntity handles creating the entities added to the map
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> like?
16:47 <+Ryozuki> hmm wait
16:52 <+Ryozuki> ok nvm
16:55 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 what about the helper methods from gamecontext being in the gameworld instead?
16:55 <+Ryozuki> (createexplosion, etc)
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, hmm, those do sound like they belong there indeed
17:16 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 maybe you could provide a todo somewhere on what stuff needs to be done, and the priority
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can grep my entire code for TODOs for small things
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should make a TODO to lay out the outline too with bigger tasks
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Entites inserting themselves does make this a tad difficult
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki hmm, when I create a new CGameWorld for a team, I'll need to iterate all the tiles on the map again to create the entities, do you think that's a good idea? :/
18:00 <+Ryozuki> hmm
18:00 <+Ryozuki> maybe we can share entities that doesnt change whether ur in a team
18:00 <+Ryozuki> or is it another thing?
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm ,I wonder how entites behave if inserted in two worlds üòÑ
18:09 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 it would be cool if teams could be completly separated, we could even have the crazy idea to have them in different threads
18:09 <+Ryozuki> idk if that would be profitable
18:09 <+Ryozuki> or possible
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yikes multithreaded
18:10 <+Ryozuki> in this modern world cpus have multiple cores
18:10 <+Ryozuki> :p
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea agree
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sounds cool but also tricky
18:11 <+Ryozuki> and complicated
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there are some things that are still shared
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have huge concerns with DoS especially when I have to iterate over the entire map to add entities when the world is created by a team
18:11 <+Ryozuki> ye we would need synchronization or whathever
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> spamming /team
18:11 <+Ryozuki> cant u just clone the team
18:11 <+Ryozuki> @Learath
18:11 <+Ryozuki> hmm
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what happens if some dickhead joins 64 dummies and does /team {1..64} on those?
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea
18:12 <+Ryozuki> xD
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what do you guys think about removing teams?
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that would iterate through the entire map 64 times
18:12 <+Ryozuki> maybe we could rethink the idea of a team yes
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe I could populate all the gameworlds on server launch, but that would be a waste of memory imho
18:12 <+Ryozuki> yeah
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> keep in mind we want to scale to unlimited slots @Learath2 :troll:
18:13 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 maybe some entity cache
18:13 <+Ryozuki> or smth
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon yeah I already have it set up so I can extend it to infinite teams or teams with names instead of numbers
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea? ‚ù§
18:14 <+Ryozuki> yes, its important that we can reach team 69
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 1337
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the only problem is the fact that creating a new team might lag the server
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which is unacceptable
18:14 <+Ryozuki> yep
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> :/
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, maybe I can thread the iteration of the map and dont let the players join the team until the world is populated
18:15 <+Ryozuki> entities are shields doors and stuff right?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y
18:16 <+Ryozuki> is it rly impossible to clone the world?
18:16 <+Ryozuki> if that makes sense
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well it isn't impossible, but in C++ this deep copy would be
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmmm, how do I put it nicely
18:17 <+Ryozuki> we could keep static entities separate from those dynamic
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> cancer
18:17 <+Ryozuki> like character
18:17 <+Ryozuki> a shield will never change
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> cant u switch shields?
18:18 <+Ryozuki> well maybe we could reset the entities to their initial state
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but yea non switches shields stay... until you collect them :troll:
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Problem isn't the fact that things change, we can clone characters aswell that's not the issue
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the issue is that the entities don't know their initial states
18:19 <+Ryozuki> then we can save them
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm, maybe a reference gameworld that no one ever joins and is eternally paused
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could copy everything over from there
18:19 <+Ryozuki> sounds like a good idea
18:19 <+Ryozuki> i wouldnt call it gameworld maybe
18:19 <+Ryozuki> it could be misleading
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It will be a `CGameWorld` we could name it whatever we want though üòÑ
18:20 <+Ryozuki> ah
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `m_ReferenceWorld`?
18:20 <+Ryozuki> ye
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I'll still need to write copy constructors for all of the entities but it's a good starting point
18:21 <+Ryozuki> we must definitly make them not self insert imho
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Let me quickly try to rework that
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder however why matricks decided to make them self insert in the first place
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a feeling I'll find his reason in a minute üòÑ
18:23 <+Ryozuki> :o
18:23 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 probs so he can do new CProjectile() and forget
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well found one problem already
18:24 <+Ryozuki> well idk
18:24 <+Ryozuki> whats it
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if it's an actual issue, but the character is only marked alive after it's inserted into the world
18:24 <+Ryozuki> well
18:24 <+Ryozuki> its a feature
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, I'll try
18:24 <+Ryozuki> when the character is dead
18:25 <+Ryozuki> it isnt even allocated
18:25 <+Ryozuki> iirc
18:25 <+Ryozuki> look into CPlayer
18:25 <+Ryozuki> it allocates it on every respawn
18:25 <+Ryozuki> iirc
18:26 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/player.cpp#L494
18:26 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/player.cpp#L565
18:26 <+Ryozuki> see
18:26 <+Ryozuki> i guess its same on vanilla
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't seem to find where CFlag is ever constructed
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh it was probably in ctf.cpp
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I don't like it
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Let me see
19:22 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 u still make the entity insert itself kinda
19:23 <+Ryozuki> hmm
19:24 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 InsertInto is a misleading name
19:24 <+Ryozuki> if its what i think it is, it should be OnInsert
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably, I just quickly whipped it up to see what changes would entail
19:26 <+Ryozuki> i think its good to have a OnInsert
19:26 <+Ryozuki> so you can clearly see what happens when its inserted
19:27 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 while you are at it maybe u can add a getter World() or something
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a getter for it
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> GameWorld()
19:27 <+Ryozuki> you dont use it
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where?
19:27 <+Ryozuki> oh wait
19:28 <+Ryozuki> the gamecontroller doesnt have it too?
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Problem is that some entities need the gameworld to construct themselves so you need to wait until insertion to get the gameworld
19:28 <+Ryozuki> which ones?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The ones that have Server() or a function call in their InsertInto's
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gamecontroller doesn't have a getter for world because there is a problem there üòÑ
19:30 <+Ryozuki> ??
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't feel like breaking the vanilla gamecontroller, but the fact that now we have multiple gameworlds the vanilla controller started falling apart
19:30 <+Ryozuki> ye
19:30 <+Ryozuki> u can always pass for example starttick and team directly
19:30 <+Ryozuki> on the constructor
19:30 <+Ryozuki> so u dont have to wait for insert
19:30 <+Ryozuki> on cproj
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe I should just cannibalize the gamecontroller
19:30 <+Ryozuki> you can also mkae a helper function on the world
19:31 <+Ryozuki> World()->CreateProjectile()
19:31 <+Ryozuki> with sensible defaults
19:32 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 u will chuckle but there is a thing called factories
19:32 <+Ryozuki> xd
19:33 <+Ryozuki> idk if this concept is used in c++ a lot tho
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You mean `public static final void __AbstractWorldEntityFactoryManagerEx`?
19:35 <+Ryozuki> well u make the worst case but ok xd
19:35 <+Ryozuki> @Learath2 one thing it doesnt make sense to me is that cprojectile gets a team on insert
19:35 <+Ryozuki> why is that
19:35 <+Ryozuki> shouldnt the world abstract that away somehow
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki we don't have access to the server until then either
19:37 <+Ryozuki> thats why a factory would solve that maybe
19:37 <+Ryozuki> if u create it through it
19:37 <+Ryozuki> the factory has access to the world
19:37 <+Ryozuki> by factory i mean a way to generalize World()->CreateProjc()
19:37 <+Ryozuki> idk
19:38 <+Ryozuki> maybe im just talking bullshit
19:38 <+Ryozuki> idk anymore
19:38 <+Ryozuki> xd
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki you mean the world itself creates and inserts the entity?
19:40 <+Ryozuki> y
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could probably abuse C++ lambda functions to achieve that
19:42 <+Ryozuki> try it
19:42 <+Ryozuki> :o
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't really like the fact that I have to call `CEntity::InsertInto` in all my overriden InsertInto's tho
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Any idea how to get that fixed?
19:42 <+Ryozuki> we could also provide always the tick when the entity was created
19:42 <+Ryozuki> hmm
19:42 <+Ryozuki> ye
19:42 <+Ryozuki> creating the from the world
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, I should add the gameworld back to the constructor if i'm letting the world construct the entity
19:43 <+Ryozuki> is a way tofix that
19:43 <+Ryozuki> why u dont just pass the parameters needed
19:43 <+Ryozuki> instead of the world
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm going out for quik food, then I'll try that
19:43 <+Ryozuki> xd
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki because some entities do actually require the world
19:43 <+Ryozuki> like which
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> laser e.g. needs intersectcharacter
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hmm, actually I can't add the gameworld back to the constructor of centity
19:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what if someone constructs an entity with one world then inserts it to another
19:47 <+Ryozuki> why you dont simply pass a reference to the charcore
19:48 <+Ryozuki> if it needs it
19:48 <+Ryozuki> why would u need to do that
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the laser intersects with others in a future time
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> not intentionally, but that is known at compile time, it should be preventable
19:49 <+Ryozuki> well if this solution just complicates things then its not good
19:49 <+Ryozuki> xD
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh,. theere should be no harm in setting things OnInsert
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As the entity won't even start ticking before insert
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you could actually run one ddnet server with valgrind to see what problems getinfo causes
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> as long as it had no players
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or use gdb and press ctrl-c a few times, the poor man's sampling
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> an easy way might be to cache the getinfo response for each second
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen I ran a ddnet server under gprof
