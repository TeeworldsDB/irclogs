01:18 < bridge> <egyt> So, **someone told me that this channel is a better place for my progress on translation** (correct me if I'm wrong).
01:18 < bridge> <egyt> __Today (19.05.2024) I translated__, like, __4 strings__, two of them being from the load screen, one being the chat and one... can't remember, actually. At least __now I have__ (probably?) __fully translated load screen__.
01:18 < bridge> <egyt> And yeah, __I made it so it says something like "[We are] doing something" instead of "doing something"__, feels a bit more personal imo. __Should get some üá∫üá¶ speakers to look at it__, if it is not cringe... but I'm too shy to do that :^(
01:18 < bridge> <egyt> UPD: forgot to mention: translated "Tutorial" as "–ü–æ—Å—ñ–±–Ω–∏–∫" ("manual", sort of) and "Learn" as "Wiki". Sometimes you have to improvise to fit into the character limits!

01:40 < bridge> <lukron55> how do i ‚Äúgroup‚Äù maps in my server by difficulty
01:50 < bridge> <lukron55> nvm i just redownloaded it
02:04 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @robyt3 I used git bisect to find the source of this issue, it's this commit: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/507b097ad82573f2ab975ce96ecaccd42551c53d
02:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Let me try smth
02:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> ah yea no
02:24 < bridge> <fokkonaut> hah, i was missing the `CNetMsg_Sv_ReadyToEnter` on design change, which triggered the function resetting that variable :D
03:10 < bridge> <0xdeen> I think the storage.cfg is no longer loaded from the current directory, but from where the DDNet-Server executable is, which breaks my secret test server setup. Not sure this is worth changing though, I'll just add some workaround
03:17 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thanks a lot @Ewan setting a C++ standard fixed the macOS pipeline <:poggers2:1008007455936094328>
03:17 < bridge> <Ewan> üòÉ
03:32 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm but only for my simplified version not the actual code base where i need it in <:tee_thinking:478629518358085653>
03:40 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok whatever i did it differently now. Its much more verbose. fakin c++
04:55 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> monrin fred
04:56 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> antibot can not be compiled standalone without a ddnet source code right?
04:58 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I am trying to build some kind of plugin system and have a hard time designing it. I would like to be able to build stuff standalone and then run unit tests against it. And also load it on the server side during the runtime of the server. Antibot seems close.
05:01 < bridge> <0xdeen> If everything is open source, just use regular C++ classes as your abstraction and add a new target to test it in isolation. Why do you need a plugin system?
06:48 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh yea nice simple idea @0xdeen c:
06:48 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how is that related to open source tho?
06:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Oh and i want hot reloading too. I wanted such a thing for server modding for a while now. And finally decided to give it a try. But it won't be a generic plugin system. Just a plugin system for one feature :D 
06:51 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its for server side controlled tees. I have 10k lines of if statements that control a tees inputs based on its coordinates and i would like to extract that out of the server code base into something that can run unit tests and also compile standalone and hot reload.
06:53 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> But yea everything is open source. But i would like to share it across multiple server projects. I think i am slowly onto something. Its gonna be a huge mess :D
09:04 < bridge> <lukron55> hi why does my server hosted on my pi only get hosted locally?
09:06 < bridge> <lukron55> usually when checking local connections there‚Äôs the local ip address and then public ip. all i can see if the local ip and none of my friends can connect with public ip
09:34 < bridge> <Ewan> did you port forward
09:34 < bridge> <Ewan> u can do like curl ipv4.icanhazip.com to see ur public ip on the pi
10:07 <+ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao `curl ipv4.icanhazip.com`
10:25 < bridge> <robyt3> Works for me on Windows. According to the source code it should first check the current directory and then the directory in the path of argv[0]
10:38 < bridge> <lukron55> no the port is definitely open.
10:39 < bridge> <lukron55> it‚Äôs been open but after reinstalling server files it no longer works
10:41 < bridge> <lukron55> register was off before as well i just sent my friends the ip
10:43 < bridge> <lukron55> the public ip is correct. i just ran a speedtest-cli to see what it is
11:08 < bridge> <zhn> gm
11:43 < bridge> <robyt3> Please comment on #8359 if you have any ideas for the ingame touch controls
11:43 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/8359
12:01 < bridge> <reitw> You can make up a script that switchs up
12:01 < bridge> <reitw> Sadly it doesn't quite do it automatically
12:01 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I saw some bash scripts which do it
12:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> But i thought maybe there's a setting for it to do it automagically
12:02 < bridge> <reitw> + at work for example the wifi was still enabled while the cable was plugged, which was prioritized for some reason
12:02 < bridge> <reitw> No, sadly there's not
12:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Ill yoink those scripts then
12:03 < bridge> <reitw> At work I just en/dis wifi on demand
12:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Thanks for the help
12:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a game idea
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill try godot
12:47 < bridge> <cyberFighter> why should the left joystick exist
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess a joy stick that can only go on x axis maybe
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is maybe still better than 2 buttons to hitr
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is maybe still better than 2 buttons to hit
12:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but dunno, no mobile gamer xD
12:50 < bridge> <robyt3> I jump with W so using joystick up to jump would be natural
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> one of the W ppl
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
12:50 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i dont know what other platformer game in existence uses a joystick to move and jump
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what would be a good deadzone tho
12:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe a button is more inuitive
12:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (at least for the jump)
12:51 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, joystick for jumping is considered not good for pros in super smash bros. üòè
12:51 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i would prefer 3 buttons like an actual keyboard with w for jump
12:51 < bridge> <robyt3> (that's also why I would have used a joystick for jumping, because it comes from those games)
12:53 < bridge> <cyberFighter> kill chat and leaderboards all in the top left corner
12:54 < bridge> <cyberFighter> thats how i play mobile ddnet rn
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but tbf ddnet has no movement based on the axis value of a joy stick
12:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's really more like buttons
13:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, there's no real axis. might still be useful to be able to change directions by only moving the finger, not needing to move away from the screen
13:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> like you can change directions on a controller d-pad by just moving the finger around, not away from the controller
13:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes but then x-axis only
13:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not add jump to it
13:13 < bridge> <texnonik> Just make movement and jump ceperated xD most of time you jump when go left or right very annoying .
13:13 < bridge> <texnonik> Different buttons for weapons .
13:13 < bridge> <texnonik> And maybe ability to dissable all and use mouse and keyboard ability .
13:42 < bridge> <reitw> i'd find it better if ur joystick going up allows u to jump
13:42 < bridge> <reitw> at least u don't have to use another finger to jump
13:42 < bridge> <reitw> or maybe have the option to choose
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but we already have a mobile pro gamer that shows us how it's done
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> :lol:
13:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4it3CFj6JcI
13:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he/she defs often doesnt press the buttons well
13:46 < bridge> <reitw> do that on a small phone now
13:46 < bridge> <reitw> :KEKSad:
13:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @forgottenabscat If you have any suggestions for touch controls for a new ddnet version for android, you could give some hints üòâ
14:18 < bridge> <cyberFighter> robyt never said the left joystick was gonna be the exact same
14:18 < bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll:
14:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thanks @cyberfighter for _saddling_ this debate
14:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> @gerdoe why didn't I ever notice you are gerdoe
16:05 < bridge> <TsFreddie> what email client do you guys use
16:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i really couldn't find one that i like on mobile
16:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> thunderbird on windows is ok. k-9 mail doesn't even try to keep it alive in the background
16:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> i use thunderbird - even tho its super slow compared to others, but the only one thats decently maintained
16:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> i heard about postbox for mac, iirc they also have a windows version
16:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> i heard about postbox for mac, iirc they also have a windows version ( i dunno if its free / FOSS ) tho
16:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> the only thing i don't like about thunderbird is that it really doesn't want to be a background application
16:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> i don't get why can't a email app just minimize to tray out of the box
16:24 < bridge> <TsFreddie> k-9 mail too. it just dies quitely. i would love email notifications
16:37 < bridge> <zhn> @chillerdragon gn
16:41 < bridge> <teero777> gm
16:44 < bridge> <peter0x44> I use "fairemail", it's okay
16:44 < bridge> <peter0x44> for the other stuff I'm using aerc
16:44 < bridge> <peter0x44> I don't like getting notifications for emails, I check when I want to
16:44 < bridge> <peter0x44> anything other than outlook is okay to me
16:44 < bridge> <peter0x44> outlook is so awful, I hate it

20:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Yea
21:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> was good, why u thought it was cringe?
21:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my voice is awful and my english is baad xdddd
21:31 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nah
21:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think it's quite good
21:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> clear pronounciation
21:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and voice always sounds weird to yourself, because you hear it differently
21:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Yup
21:32 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I hate hearing my voice

21:48 < bridge> <lukron55> how do i get maps in my server? i‚Äôve got cloned the ddnet-maps into /ddnet/build/data/maps
21:48 < bridge> <lukron55> but they dont appear inside of my server?
22:08 < bridge> <lukron55> shore they be moved out of the ddnet-maps directory to the maps folder?
22:08 < bridge> <lukron55> or can they say?
22:08 < bridge> <lukron55> should they be moved out of the ddnet-maps directory to the maps folder?
22:09 < bridge> <lukron55> or can they stay?
22:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try starting the server from /ddnet/build
22:09 < bridge> <lukron55> i do
22:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> i.e. `cd ddnet/build` and then `./DDNet-Server`
22:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> unpack
22:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what does the output say about `autoexec_server.cfg`?
22:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> unpack into /data/maps
22:10 < bridge> <lukron55> one sec
22:11 < bridge> <lukron55> is it not already just a folder and not a tar.gz
22:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> if your maps are located under `/ddnet/build/data/maps/ddnet-maps` rn move the files one directory up
22:12 < bridge> <lukron55> everything in ddnet-maps > maps?
22:13 < bridge> <lukron55> what should i write? 
22:13 < bridge> <lukron55> mv /home/lukron/ddnet/build/data/maps/ddnet-maps/ /home/lukron/ddnet/build/data/maps/
22:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> mv /home/lukron/ddnet/build/data/maps/ddnet-maps/* /home/lukron/ddnet/build/data/maps/
22:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
22:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> to move all contents from ddnet-maps to maps
22:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> mv /home/lukron/ddnet/build/data/maps/ddnet-maps/* /home/lukron/ddnet/build/data/maps/
22:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
22:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> to move all contents from ddnet-maps to maps (the `*`)
22:14 < bridge> <lukron55> oh yeah cheers
22:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> mv /home/lukron/ddnet/build/data/maps/ddnet-maps/* /home/lukron/ddnet/build/data/maps/
22:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
22:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> to move all contents from ddnet-maps to maps. (the `*`)
22:15 < bridge> <lukron55> still not there
22:20 < bridge> <lukron55> @blaiszephyr it just showed the normal maps still
22:21 < bridge> <lukron55> after moving everything, should i replace the autoexecconfig file back one to the main data folder and put it there in replacement?
22:54 < bridge> <lukron55> i am struggling to do this. i moved it and it did nothing
22:56 < bridge> <lukron55> do i move the autoexecconfig file in replace of the one that‚Äôs already in /data/
22:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try that
23:12 < bridge> <lukron55> makes sense now
23:15 < bridge> <lukron55> tysm
23:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you're welcome üôÇ
23:18 < bridge> <lukron55> just gotta fix up my entire data and maps folder as i managed to copy the ddnet-server back a directory twice
