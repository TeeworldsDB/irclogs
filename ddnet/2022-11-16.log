00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> What a heeeeell
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats pog
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good usage of http master sv
00:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @Ryozuki how packages for NixOs work, are they from apt repos?
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> What the fuck, i just found rust developer vacancy with almost $2k salary, didnt think companies using it on this level already
01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> What the fuck, i just found rust developer vacancy with $2k+ salary, didnt think companies using it on this level already
03:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> real nice
07:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Apt is only a debian thing
09:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> NixOS has its completely own packaging called Nixpkgs. You can use Nix (the package manager) on other distros as well
09:14 <+Ryozuki> morning ddnet
09:19 <+ChillerDragon> o/
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> So someone already uploaded ddnet to nix packages :justatest:
09:26 <+ChillerDragon> yes
09:26 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/master/pkgs/games/ddnet
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> mornin
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> you guys slept well? I didn't :LOL:
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Thats why i asked about apt, i literally never heard of nixOs but there is ddnet pkg already
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Too bad
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I mean, I didn't sleep
09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I'm working on the project
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Good luck not falling asleep till 18:00
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I've been through worse tbh
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I rarely can stand on by feet by that time
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> well thx :kek:
09:33 <+Ryozuki> nixos is pretty famous rn
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> It literally got recommended in my dms, never happened with me before:greenthing:
09:35 <+Ryozuki> im learning tmux rn
09:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> teemux
09:35 <+Ryozuki> nixos allows to have a reproducible OS
09:36 <+Ryozuki> its pretty poggers
09:36 <+Ryozuki> but i would say its more useful for servers
09:36 <+Ryozuki> i use gentoo btw
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I (want to) use windows btw
09:36 <+Ryozuki> ew
09:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> My old shitty laptop doesnt allow me to install it
09:37 <+Ryozuki> use linux on old laptop
09:37 <+Ryozuki> its more useful
09:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Its old but with decent specs
09:38 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki why combine tmux with a tiling window manager?
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> unless it bugs out for every god damn second cuz of the integrated graphics card :kekw:
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> that's whats going on with my shitty notebook rn
09:40 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon: im not home
09:40 <+Ryozuki> but im connected to my pc
09:40 <+Ryozuki> ssh
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> and with that in mind, any laptops for recommendation? :brownbear:
09:40 <+Ryozuki> tmux is like a tiling window manager over ssh lol
09:40 <+Ryozuki> poggers
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Anything but not mac
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> if I choose anything, it will be like the notebook I mentioned
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I'm bad at choosing
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> apple sux
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Just choose by specs :monkalaugh: 
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I got i7 and 2gb vram on 2014 fucking laptop, its very heavy lol
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> should I choose amd specific ones?
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I'm in a budget of 600€
09:44 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: ye ik tmux i could not live without it :) its rly pog
09:44 <+Ryozuki> brb i need to fix tmux not doing utf8 properly
09:44 <+ChillerDragon> xaxax
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Тоо бад

09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Scrumplex> their usernames are "sirseruju" and "lom"
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its hard on nixos to set march native and compile properly
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Also u dont make ur own kernel

10:18 <+ChillerDragon> - sent from discord
11:04 <+Ryozuki> ok
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> hehe get bullied
11:28 <+ChillerDragon> me starring at snap data until it makes sense ... https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668594509.png
11:29 <+ChillerDragon> https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slashfilm.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-content%2Fimages%2Fmatrix-code-streaming.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=185465f9b6b9b3aed77085b44ee5f0ac7fe11792384f8d2fafe3cac990c202c1&ipo=images
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> someone should have told me how op the "." is in vim
11:38 <+Ryozuki> lmao . is repeat
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> i always knew that but never really knew how to use it but u dont wanna know how inefficent my vim workflow is xd
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> gotta spice it up with .
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> yo ryo go send some vim trix
11:39 <+Ryozuki> learn macros
11:39 <+Ryozuki> https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Macros
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Good start splitting it into groups of 4
11:40 <+Ryozuki> u can also do 4.
11:40 <+Ryozuki> to repeat the last command 4 times
11:40 <+Ryozuki> i also do a lot "dt<something>"
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 thanks sensei
11:40 <+Ryozuki> where something is for example $ or ;
11:40 <+Ryozuki> to delete till ;
11:40 <+ChillerDragon> i listen yo advice it all ints
11:40 <+Ryozuki> dt = delete till
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> but tw ints could also be more than 4 bytes huh?
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> i mean mostly less xd
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> omg every time i tried macros i had to google how to exit vim
11:42 <+ChillerDragon> delete till? i use df like delete from cursor to ; i type df;
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea prefix with number is also op i will keep it in mind when starting to use the . more
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> ah dt is exclusive and df is inclusive
11:44 <+ChillerDragon> i guess picking your fav is the way to go otherwise i use so much brain power to decide if i wanna inclusive or exclusive
11:55 <+Ryozuki> you know the go to line right
11:55 <+Ryozuki> i recommend you put line numbers relative to current
11:56 <+Ryozuki> so you can do 20k to go 20 lines up
11:56 <+Ryozuki> and u know exactly where that line is due to relative
11:56 <+Ryozuki> you can also do 40gg to go to line 40
11:56 <+Ryozuki> G to go to last line
11:56 <+Ryozuki> gg to go to first
11:57 <+Ryozuki> i also often do 20dj to delete 20 lines down
11:58 <+Ryozuki> and V and select the lines then press :
11:58 <+Ryozuki> and do a replace
11:59 <+Ryozuki> oh
11:59 <+Ryozuki> another useful thing are markers
11:59 <+Ryozuki> go where you want and type "ma" in normal mode
12:00 <+Ryozuki> you put a marker under a
12:00 <+Ryozuki> then u press 'a
12:00 <+Ryozuki> and you move there
12:00 <+Ryozuki> it works rly well when working e.g with header and cpp files in cpp
12:00 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon: 
12:01 <+Ryozuki> i need to learn weechat keybinds
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> yes i use relative num
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> for gotoline i use :
12:02 <+ChillerDragon> so :40
12:03 <+ChillerDragon> whats the V and and press : what does the colon do there?
12:03 <+ChillerDragon> so markers are specific lines you can jump to? never felt the urge to do that
12:04 <+ChillerDragon> what weechat bindings?
12:04 <+ChillerDragon> i basicially use none xd
12:04 <+ChillerDragon> only option+arrow ctrl+r and my custom ctrl+k to search buffers
12:06 <+Ryozuki> markers are specific line and col number yes
12:06 <+Ryozuki> V is select but in lines
12:06 <+Ryozuki> so if you press :
12:07 <+Ryozuki> it puts smth there where the command you put next is applied to all the selection only
12:07 <+Ryozuki> so if you do a replace its only applied to the selection
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not in snaps
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I use ^ and $ very often in vim
12:16 <+ChillerDragon> Yes i am aware of my lack of ^ and $ usage its just so hard for me to type so i replaced it with shift+a and shift+i .-.
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> ah cool so snap ints fixed to 4 bytes? thats cool but also sounds like i need a new (un)packer code
12:17 <+ChillerDragon> also nvm im too stoopid to use . in vim
12:19 <+ChillerDragon> Ryozuki: what kind of commands do you apply in the V case? I actually use that but only with s/sub/with/g and im way slower doing that then using the vscode ctrl+d way
12:24 <+ChillerDragon> What was the cool word that describes the information about what is what on a chart? xd
12:24 <+ChillerDragon> Lets say you have some pie chart with 3 colors and then next to it some text that tell you what color means what how is that text called?
12:25 <+ChillerDragon> index? agenda? appendix? there is something i forgot how to call that
12:27 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668598044.png
12:29 <+ChillerDragon> table of contents?
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Legend
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> A
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> yes u
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> are legend
12:32 <+ChillerDragon> thanks
12:35 <+Ryozuki> if you press 0 you got to start of line
12:35 <+Ryozuki> actually
12:35 <+Ryozuki> you dont need to press :
12:35 <+Ryozuki> on a V selection
12:35 <+Ryozuki> just press /
12:36 <+Ryozuki> and do your replacement
12:36 <+Ryozuki> V <select> /a/b/g
12:36 <+Ryozuki> works
12:36 <+Ryozuki> actually nevermind im wrong
12:36 <+Ryozuki> u need s
12:36 <+Ryozuki> xd
12:37 <+Ryozuki> i also use it only to replace right now
12:37 <+Ryozuki> or to delete more visually
14:54 <+Ryozuki> test
15:07 <+ChillerDragon> failed
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> was totally worth to spend the whole day on this xd
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668610090.png
16:43 <+ChillerDragon> heinrich pls dont ban me for doing NSFW jokes on libtw2
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Did we disable lto now completely? How does that affect binary size with our new rust code?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Idc really about the size but would still like to know. Eg. Wherever i will add a huge lib
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> For future
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I did for official build. Check nightly vs last release
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yeah but dunno if @heinrich5991 already added some lib except cxx. Tho dunno it's dependencies^^
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> The size looks pretty normal
16:58 <+Ryozuki> its common to use libs in rust
16:59 <+Ryozuki> for example to generate random numbers, its not part of the std
16:59 <+Ryozuki> so you depend on "rand"
16:59 <+Ryozuki> here are some common crates (libs): https://blessed.rs/crates
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yeah. But yesterday i tried some stuff locally and without lto 4mb with lto 200kb.. so this sums up rather quickly
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Don't want to be the reason for 2000gb binary xdd
17:01 <+Ryozuki> thats pog
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> When u use a c lib it early had many dependencies. On rust it's different(not saying that this is bad)
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Rarely*
17:02 <+Ryozuki> cuz its a pain in the ass to use libs in c
17:02 <+Ryozuki> ppl just reinvent the wheel
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yes
17:02 <+Ryozuki> and often badly
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yes
17:02 <+Ryozuki> i can be sure the essential crates are battle tested
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> As said not meant negative
17:03 <+Ryozuki> yes i know xd
17:03 <+Ryozuki> the thing u tried locally with lto was a rust binary or lib?
17:03 <+Ryozuki> or a cpp one
17:03 <+Ryozuki> i think rust benefits greatly from lto
17:04 <+Ryozuki> even with thinlto
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Rust binary
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Yeah much more than cpp binaries usually do. Only thing i could effectively shrink cpp was PGO
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but it didn't increase performance at all xdd
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Only shrink binaries by 100%
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Or 50% xd
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> From original size
17:14 <+ChillerDragon> Yo @Learath2 if all ints are 4 bytes long and my snap payload dump is not divsible by 4 I did something wrong huh? Also where in the code does it tell it to pack the ints as 32 bit?
17:15 <+ChillerDragon> the last line misses a byte :c 
17:15 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668615308.png
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eeeh, been a long while since I looked. I know each item in a snap has to be exactly divisible by 4 so maybe some header I'm forgetting
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you undo huffman yet?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'll obv be wrong before decompression
17:21 <+ChillerDragon> yes yes
17:21 <+ChillerDragon> i huffman pro
17:22 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668615755.png
17:22 <+ChillerDragon> heinrichs dissector is never wrong!
17:23 <+ChillerDragon> it says data is 43 bytes which is missing 1 byte to be divisible by 4
17:23 <+ChillerDragon> so im good :)
17:23 <+ChillerDragon> but still weird huh?
17:23 <+ChillerDragon> AH
17:23 <+ChillerDragon> omg no heinrich dissector is ofc wrong
17:24 <+ChillerDragon> thats what i wanted to fix in the pr
17:24 <+ChillerDragon> i rage quitted
17:24 <+ChillerDragon> OMG HOW DID I FORGET THAT xd
17:24 <+ChillerDragon> uzawdgzawzgduaiwd
17:24 <+ChillerDragon> aw8hdoi
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> so @heinrich5991 any reason your dissector includes this chunk in the data? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/268d2501cd5bfc86376cee5941829e13cffddc50/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L982
17:25 <+ChillerDragon> i tried to pr a fix but it broke everything :c
17:43 <+ChillerDragon> something seems wrong xd @Learath2 any ideas? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668616990.png
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> according to libtw docs first 16 bytes are the type and 2nd are the id
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> but my numbers get way too big ._.+
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> does the snap do additional compression to the regular huffman compression?
17:49 <+ChillerDragon> ah @Learath2 i think i did a wopsi brain error and forgot that the snap also contains data not only the item header :D
17:50 <+ChillerDragon> and then prolly little endianess and all ez
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also I remember type and id sharing two ints but not equally
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can take a quick look after I eat if you are still stuck
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also not all item types are statically sized, those will have their size in there too
18:10 <+ChillerDragon> static vs dyn size i somewhat am aware of. But libtw docs say they share the 32 equally :C
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, it is 16 bits each yeah, sorry. I was thinking of something else :/
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Is there a rss feed for latest finishes?
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Maybe i can hack a live db by fetching there xd
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> F
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Guess one cant rly replicate the website
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do it with old data, that‘s ok
