01:14 < bridge> <Ewan> is there an existing api in tw to have real time for operations
01:15 < bridge> <Ewan> like not just waiting x frames but waiting x amount of seconds
01:17 < bridge> <Ewan> like how can i store a time & check if it's more than X amount of time in da future
02:37 < bridge> <alfredtony> Thank me letter https://t.me/+4TqDfR5nQ2Q3ODg0
03:10 < bridge> <YupHio> @Welshi had a map today that was causing a bug on any online server, but worked fine on any LAN server. Will get details.
03:13 < bridge> <YupHio> This map won't load on any online server, but loads on LAN servers. Please diagnose.

06:36 < bridge> <Welshi> already fixed it @YupHio
06:37 < bridge> <Welshi> asked in #bugs
09:36 < bridge> <deen> @Davide Can we make all ddnet clients auto-verify? Not just one specific version?
09:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, by making an http request
09:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i love how easy it is to switch to deno with svelte
09:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this reminds me i should use deno more instead of js
09:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its like 20x faster
09:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and native typescript support xD
09:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (i.e no transpiling to js)
09:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this reminds me i should use deno more instead of nodejs
10:29 <+ChillerDragon> deno poggies
10:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 16.8
10:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ryozuki @heinrich5991 last chance to fix skin bug ^^
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> yo @heinrich5991 did i configure/install something wrongly or is the dissector super broken on vanilla 0.6 traffic? 
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1677319876.png
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> it should be map download messages

13:56 < bridge> <fokkonaut> which version can auto verify, and how?
14:04 <+ChillerDragon> by doing a http request
14:16 < bridge> <deen> No, it's supposed to auto-verify for released version without http request
14:39 <+ChillerDragon> ah
14:41 <+ChillerDragon> how? is the firewall looking at the version? Isn't that then just allowing one to bypass the firewall by sending the released version?
14:49 < bridge> <ReiTW> I don't think Davide would like to share how he does
18:36 <+ChillerDragon> if its in the ddnet client is public anyways isnt it? xd
19:18 < bridge> <ReiTW> ig the verification isn't done client-side
20:28 < bridge> <Ewan> does the game have any concept of which server it's playing on (e.g. usa2) besides the IP and MOTD
20:29 < bridge> <Ewan> does the game have any concept of which server it's playing on (e.g. usa2) besides the IP, server title and MOTD
20:30 < bridge> <Ewan> or will i have to pick it out of the title
20:35 < bridge> <Ewan> üòÉ
20:36 < bridge> <ùôóùô°ùô§ùôòùô†ùôóùô™ùô®ùô©ùôöùôß> how do i change the mouse cursor?

20:45 < bridge> <ùôóùô°ùô§ùôòùô†ùôóùô™ùô®ùô©ùôöùôß> not working
20:47 < bridge> <Ewan> did you delete it
20:49 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Is there a way to prevent DDNet from locking the cursor?
20:50 < bridge> <Kaffeine> When I stop on a break point or a crash, the game is still holding the cursor until I continue the execution or let it crash.
20:51 < bridge> <Kaffeine> I have https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/5143 crash in the debugger but I can't do anything :-/.
20:51 < bridge> <Kaffeine> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1079128433436672000/image.png
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> you can (probably) find something along the lines of this in DDNet's input code
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> `SDL_WM_GrabInput( SDL_GRAB_ON );`
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> turn it off and you should theoretically be okay
20:53 < bridge> <Ewan> also Qt Creator vouch
20:54 < bridge> <ùôóùô°ùô§ùôòùô†ùôóùô™ùô®ùô©ùôöùôß> @Ewan Green
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> what
20:54 < bridge> <ùôóùô°ùô§ùôòùô†ùôóùô™ùô®ùô©ùôöùôß> can you post a working cursor png
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> it needs to be called gui_cursor.png
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> you can (probably) find something along the lines of this in DDNet's input code
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> `SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode(SDL_TRUE);`
20:54 < bridge> <Ewan> engine/client/input.cpp Kaffeine
20:55 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Found (when you've edited the message).
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah the old one was outdated apparently
20:55 < bridge> <ùôóùô°ùô§ùôòùô†ùôóùô™ùô®ùô©ùôöùôß> oh thanks bro
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> but it should probably actually be false
20:55 < bridge> <Ewan> pucker up bro
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> you can (probably) find something along the lines of this in DDNet's input code
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> `SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode(SDL_FALSE);`
20:56 < bridge> <Ewan> change it and you should theoretically be okay
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> if that doesn't work Kaffeine try intercepting `CGraphics_Threaded::SetWindowGrab` in `engine/client/graphics_threaded.cpp`
20:58 < bridge> <ùôóùô°ùô§ùôòùô†ùôóùô™ùô®ùô©ùôöùôß> @Ewan Green how to make font
20:58 < bridge> <Ewan> dont know pls go to #questions
21:00 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Oh, that is funny. I see the cursor but mouse events are not passed to the windows. I've tried to comment out `CInput::MouseModeRelative()`.
21:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess the normal server name would be appropriate, but some servers have absurdly long names (*cough cough* KoG *cough cough*)
21:00 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Thanks! Trying...
21:01 < bridge> <Ewan> not to mention fokkonaut's stuff and whatever else that is similar
21:02 < bridge> <Ewan> i had a similar issue the other day Kaffeine but it wasn't just the cursor. I was stuck in fullscreen and I didn't know if there was a shortcut within Qt Creator to kill the process being debugged, lol
21:02 < bridge> <Ewan> i had to kill & reload the IDE
21:02 < bridge> <Ewan> it kinda sucked
21:02 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Still does not work (mouse events are not passed to other windows until I continue or kill the client).
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> oh, do you want it to be transparent for mouse events?
21:03 < bridge> <Ewan> you just set it to false right?
21:04 < bridge> <Ewan> commenting out the call would probably also work but false is more of a sure thing, i think
21:04 < bridge> <Kaffeine> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1079131749822501005/image.png
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i would replace with calls with false as tje parameter
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i would replace with calls with false as the parameter
21:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what i usually do is pressing meta key + d, which is a KDE script to minimize all windows and frees the mouse
21:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1079132248286175292/image.png
21:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when u enabled it
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> cool that exists in KDE
21:06 < bridge> <Ewan> i never liked plasma that much
21:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what do u use xd
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i used xfce
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> now i am on windows
21:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1079132764332363787/image.png
21:08 < bridge> <Kaffeine> üòÑ it does not free the cursor to me.
21:08 < bridge> <Kaffeine> 
21:08 < bridge> <Kaffeine> I've also tried to use Windowed mode and quite a few of other options. Still can't have the cursor in IDE when on a break point.
21:08 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Seems to be enabled by default. Worked out of the box, except to freeing the pointer.
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well its different to the normal meta +d behavior of KDE
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which only shows the desktop xD
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but if u are sure its the correct bind
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then weird
21:09 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Oh ok! I'll try it then.
21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs i use it since 5 years
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> jupstar do you know anything about this?
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> ideally i would just want to get, like
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> "DDNet usa2" or w/e
21:10 < bridge> <Ewan> instead of the whole title
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh i guess they have a database name that corresponds to USA2 etc
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do u want it server side or client side?
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> client side
21:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then i assume it does not know it
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> for my bar here
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1079133592090845204/image.png
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> if the string is too long it would be obnoxiously wide
21:11 < bridge> <Ewan> alright
21:17 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Wow! After years of suffering! Thank you @Jupeyy_Keks ! ‚ù§Ô∏è 
21:17 < bridge> <Kaffeine> 
21:17 < bridge> <Kaffeine> It is a workaround and I'm sure there is a way to just prevent DDNet from locking the cursor but hm, not a big deal for me anymore.  Still thank you @Ewan Green for the answers.
21:49 < bridge> <Ewan> i wonder if it would be considered cheating to add a feature that indicates relative positions to another tee
21:50 < bridge> <Chairn> i have the same problem on windows, hopefully i use gdb through console so no need for a cursor üòÑ
21:50 < bridge> <Ewan> a badge above their head (like the hook strength indicator) that would be green if you share the same pos to 2 decimal places, yellow if you'd stack, red if you're nowhere near
21:50 < bridge> <Ewan> and maybe another one that shows walled left/right
21:50 < bridge> <Ewan> a badge above their head (like the hook strength indicator) that would be green if you share the same X pos to 2 decimal places, yellow if you'd stack, red if you're nowhere near
21:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> under windows the trick works too, atleast it did 5 years ago xd
21:59 < bridge> <Chairn> today i learn
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> hah
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> i save the command line gdb for when i need to make a backtrace or dump and that's pretty much it
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> it is not a very fun debugging experience
22:00 < bridge> <Ewan> it is not a very fun debugging experience imo
22:07 < bridge> <Chairn> i often don't need much more
22:07 < bridge> <Chairn> but i don't track really complex bug either
22:21 < bridge> <Ewan> me neither
