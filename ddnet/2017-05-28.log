14:35 <+Ryozuki> i found a rly weird thing, its hilarius, but when i join to a server in ddnet, my tv starts to get bad signal xD
14:35 <+Ryozuki> thats so weird
14:41 <@deen> sounds like normal interference. get an isolated cable for your tv
14:42 <@deen> you could run a radio just by showing pictures on your CRT
14:43 <@deen> apprently still works with some LCD
16:12 < grenadepro> hi , deen i saw your chat (log) ok you right but i tested it with "echo ban "184.232.22.37" > servers/*.fifo" it didnt work too .
16:13 <@deen> well, maybe that's the wrong ip?
16:13 <@deen> but i have to admit i never tried to ban an ip
16:13 <@deen> always id
16:14 <@deen> actually, always just ingame clicking the thing
16:15 < grenadepro> i need to ban someone in other servers in same time
17:26 < laxa> Nimda updated to announce Insane difficulty release
17:31 <@Nimda> Adrenaline 4 by Silex just released on Insane at 2017-05-25 19:00
18:31 < grenadepro> seems cant send echo ban from fifo to server
19:12 <+WolfAlex> grenadepro: try it without the " around the ip
