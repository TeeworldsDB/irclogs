06:20 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] heinrich5991 opened pull request #865: Add `./configure` script (master...pr_ddnet_configure) https://git.io/v59Zn
08:17 <@deen> Lots of activity on ddnet github
08:17 <@deen> I'm kinda busy, so don't expect reviews
09:21 <@deen> also, DDNet GER is using kind of a lot of RAM since the debian 9 update. I guess it's mariadb, but don't have this on ddnet.tw and USA
09:26 <+ochristi> were some configs replaced/defaults changed?
09:26 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> I checked already
09:27 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> configs seem ok
09:28 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> oh, actually uses the same amount of memory on USA. So maybe something else is eating too much RAM

09:46 <@deen> heinrich5991: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=5681&p=57503#p57503
12:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yesterday i noticed lags and i checked status and ger was using a lot of ram
12:56 <@heinrich5991> deen: thanks for the link
13:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's only me, or demos seems much smoother now ?
13:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> They always seemed smooth to me
16:10 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: TXZ doesn't seem so be supported on that version of cmake
16:10 <+Learath2> maybe we should update cmake afterall
16:12 <@heinrich5991> but the gz thing worked?
16:12 <+Learath2> yes
16:13 <@heinrich5991> cool :)
16:13 <+Learath2> oh noes
16:13 <+Learath2> it didn't
16:13 <+Learath2> it still produces an empty tar gz
16:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> is there a way in mapeditor
16:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> to
16:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> ctrl z
16:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> xd
16:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> undo*
16:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> cl_editorundo 1
16:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> k ty
16:58 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (not clear if that works, I just entered undo into the console and that's why I got)
17:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 a ddnet protocol documentation would be really cool
17:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "If you want, we could work together to create some documentation. You can find me on IRC, or on many instant messengers."
17:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i would be glad to help
17:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (ik u told this to moien007 :P)
17:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> (referring to https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=5681&p=57503#p57509)
17:20 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> well, what would you like to see documented?
17:21 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I asked that person because they probably know what exactly they need, so we could document it in the process
17:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> .
17:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> btw
17:25 <+quinerr> hi, anyone here?
17:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> why is the protocol.h made with a python script?
17:25 <@heinrich5991> hi quinerr :)
17:25 <@heinrich5991> yes, ask away
17:25 <+Ryozuki> quinerr, hi
17:26 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki because it is repetitive and would be prone to errors if it wouldn't be generated
17:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> is there a setting that make you not respawn instantly when you kill
17:26 <+quinerr> i've seen (maybe) some of you want to push ddnet into Debian. are you still interested in this?
17:27 <@heinrich5991> yes, I think we're interested in this
17:27 <+Ryozuki> yea
17:27 <@heinrich5991> (it wouldn't end up in a stable immediately, right? so we have some room for errors?)
17:27 <+Ryozuki> (i also like writing in parenthesis :D)
17:28 <+quinerr> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=794166
17:28 <+Ryozuki> 2015
17:28 <+Ryozuki> :o
17:29 <@heinrich5991> that's from deen, the maintainer :)
17:29 <@heinrich5991> a few other devs hang out in this channel
17:29 <@heinrich5991> why do you ask? are there specific problems we'd need to address for inclusion in debian?
17:31 <+quinerr> no, i just want to sure my work won't ruin :)
17:31 <+Ryozuki> heinrich5991, about the protocol, i want to create a console only client without graphics, to do some experiments. And i think its better to start from scratch than ripping of graphics from the original client.
17:32 <+quinerr> I do have a question, are you prefer bam or cmake build system?
17:32 <@heinrich5991> cmake
17:32 <+Ryozuki> bam will be removed
17:32 <@heinrich5991> we'll phase bam out eventually
17:33 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: you can use my library, https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2
17:33 <+Ryozuki> but i don't know rust
17:34 <@heinrich5991> fair enough. so what you'd like to see documented is the high-level view of the protocol?
17:34 <+Ryozuki> yea
17:34 <@heinrich5991> i.e. stuff like "what messages do I send in which order to connect to a server"?
17:35 <+Ryozuki> exactly that
17:35 <@heinrich5991> that seems doable, let's do that together :)
17:35 <+Ryozuki> :)
17:36 <+quinerr> ok, then see you later
17:37 <+Ryozuki> heinrich5991, so where we start? 
17:37 <@heinrich5991> see you
17:37 <@heinrich5991> feel free to come to this channel and ask any questions :) we still have to improve documentation on building
17:41 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: gimme a few minutes, currently have to pack some stuff
17:41 <+Ryozuki> np
17:41 <@heinrich5991> do you know how we could document that?
17:41 <@heinrich5991> should we do a flow-chart?
17:41 <@heinrich5991> mh.
17:42 <+Ryozuki> i have little experience with flow-charts
17:42 <+Ryozuki> but they are good i think
17:43 <+Ryozuki> u know any opensource program to make them?
17:45 <@heinrich5991> this looks nice: https://ivanceras.github.io/elm-examples/elm-bot-lines/ :)
17:45 <@heinrich5991> anyway, probably get the content first and worry about presentation later
17:45 <+Ryozuki> lol
17:46 <+Ryozuki> this is a web tool but looks good also https://www.draw.io/
17:46 <+Ryozuki> and yea
17:47 <@heinrich5991> I don't know how much you looked into the source already ^^
17:47 <@heinrich5991> but how I tried to get ahold of this process was to check what the client sends first (NETMSG_INFO IIRC)
17:47 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L674
17:48 <@heinrich5991> and then switch back and forth between client and server source code to see what they do in reaction to these
17:48 <@heinrich5991> I suggest heavy use of grep or some full-text search ^^
17:53 <+Ryozuki> after connecting, it send a CNetMsg_Cl_StartInfo packet
17:53 <+Ryozuki> i can't find where it connects tho
17:55 <+Ryozuki> SendControl(NET_CTRLMSG_CONNECT, SECURITY_TOKEN_MAGIC, sizeof(SECURITY_TOKEN_MAGIC));
17:55 <+Ryozuki> looks like its this
17:55 <+Ryozuki> what is a control message?
17:56 <@heinrich5991> ok, this is a different layer
17:56 <@heinrich5991> we can document that as well :)
17:56 <+Ryozuki> good :o
17:56 <@heinrich5991> it's basically a tiny protocol that the high-level teeworlds protocol uses
17:57 <+Ryozuki> so we should start with that?
17:57 <@heinrich5991> it provides connections and opt-in reliable messages
17:57 <@heinrich5991> mh. dunno, the higher level might be more useful
17:57 <@heinrich5991> do you have a prefernece? ^^
17:58 <@heinrich5991> (the low-level protocol has basically nothing to do with teeworlds, the game)
17:58 <+Ryozuki> do i need the low level protocol to connect to the server?
17:59 <@heinrich5991> well depends. do you want to use the source code network.cpp, network_server.cpp network_client.cpp network_conn.cpp?
17:59 <@heinrich5991> if yes, then you don't need to figure out the details of the protocol
17:59 <@heinrich5991> (these don't access the UI in any way, they cna be used without the rest of teeworlds)
17:59 <+Ryozuki> i guess its lot easier to use that source
18:00 <+Ryozuki> well then go for the high level
18:00 <+Ryozuki> i will also dont have to fight with compression
18:01 <@heinrich5991> yuo
18:01 <@heinrich5991> yup
18:01 <+Ryozuki> so, connecting is made using the low level-ish protocol but after that its high level, right?
18:01 <@heinrich5991> yes
18:01 <@heinrich5991> the high-level protocol communication starts with NETMSG_INFO in src/engine/client/client.cpp
18:02 <+Ryozuki> yes
18:02 <+Ryozuki> i think its better to look at gameclient.cpp
18:02 <+Ryozuki> it uses SendInfo on OnConnected
18:03 <@heinrich5991> that's a few packets later
18:03 <+Ryozuki> hmm
18:03 <@heinrich5991> first, the engine connection is established, and then the game connection ^^
18:03 <+Ryozuki> ah
18:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it sounds like an interesting conversation
18:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> keep going ðŸ˜„
18:05 <+Ryozuki> sec, im writing this down
18:07 <+Ryozuki> https://github.com/Ryozuki/ddnet-protocol-info
18:07 <+Ryozuki> we can continue
18:09 <@heinrich5991> aww, I wanted to add that to my doc collection in libtw2 :P https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/tree/master/doc
18:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe the first line should tell you which files do this? ðŸ˜„
18:09 <@heinrich5991> anyway, content ^^
18:09 <+Ryozuki> well this can be temporary
18:09 <+Ryozuki> i dont mind where it is, if i can access it
18:09 <+Ryozuki> :P
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It wasn't be cool, to make that repo in "ddnet" group? :Clippy:
18:10 <@heinrich5991> ok. will be away for an hour or so soon
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> as it is a part? ðŸ˜„
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> + I SUGGEST! To split it in seection like
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> only DDNet
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and Teeworlds
18:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if its possible
18:11 <@heinrich5991> it will mostly bbe compatible
18:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜ƒ
18:11 <@heinrich5991> afk now
18:11 <+Ryozuki> :/
18:12 <@heinrich5991> I#ll give you another two minutes.. ^^
18:12 <+Ryozuki> is NETMSG_ENTERGAME used to enter the game from spectators?
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Let's think about sections? :>.
18:13 <@heinrich5991> no, I think that's the message that starts the game protocol
18:13 <@heinrich5991> from that point, the whole conn is established
18:13 <+Ryozuki> so after sending version info, the server answers with something?
18:13 <@heinrich5991> yes, and you can find out by searching NETMSG_INFO in the tw source code ^^
18:13 <+Ryozuki> if not i guess client loads and then sends a NETMSG_READY
18:14 <+Ryozuki> :o
18:14 <+Ryozuki> let me check
18:15 <+Ryozuki> i just found https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/datafile.md nice to have this documented aswell ^^
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I'm curious, why heinrich isn't main maintainer of teeworlds
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> very active, smart guy with powerful abilities
18:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> instead of, guy which don't want to continue with tw
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and he's Moderator there, a long story behind.! :/
18:18 <+Ryozuki> after the NETMSG_INFO the server sends the map
18:18 <+Ryozuki> (well, first NETMSG_RCONTYPE then the map)
18:18 <@heinrich5991> so now I really have to go
18:18 <@heinrich5991> bye
18:20 <+Ryozuki> bye
18:32 <+Ryozuki> this is the progress so far https://git.io/v5HVq
18:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i think, those link can be changed later, so maybe just filename or something? or segment of code insidee that readme
18:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yea
18:45 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: can we even have an autoupdating game in debian?
20:38 <+Learath2> deen: is it possible to keep saves in a namechange?
20:40 <+ddnet-discord> <HMH> @Learath2 what do you mean, if you mean /save one can just load it with the old name ?
20:40 <+Learath2> well yeah, i guess i'll leave that to him
21:34 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: i think i'll just update cmake on circle before building
22:36 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: no
22:36 <@heinrich5991> we have distro update then
22:36 <+Learath2> ?
22:36 <@heinrich5991> say hello to backwards-compatibility
22:37 <+Learath2> i meant building cmake and caching it like bam
22:38 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: was answering the other question, autoupdating on debian
22:38 <+Learath2> oh yeah, so we'll need a LTS version for debian :D
22:40 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: does make package require cpack to be in PATH?
22:40 <+Learath2> seems to work but should i rely on it?
23:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Guys
23:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i can't type "Ä˜"
23:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> In ddnet, cause it opens map editor
23:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> right Alt + shift + E
23:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> okay, left shift
23:10 <+Learath2> Savander your alt key might be stuck?
23:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why?
23:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> instead of Ä˜
23:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it opens map editor
23:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> not only for me
23:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> for my friend as well
23:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> right alt + left shift + e
23:18 <+Learath2> oh didn't see the interesting dot under the E
23:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that's polish character ðŸ˜„
23:18 <+Learath2> should disable that shortcut while typing i guess?
23:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yup, could be great
23:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I didn't even know
23:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that such shortcut exists..
23:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I always used ctrl + shift + e
23:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> left side
23:22 <+fstd_> the worst shortcut is ctrl+shift+q :(
23:23 <+fstd_> i accidentally it all the time, so i eventually changed it to ctrl+shift+p ^^
23:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> hoho
23:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> never used ðŸ˜®
23:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> shouldn't be some kind of popout
23:23 <+fstd_> it unlocks ze cheats
23:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "HEy are you sure ? "
23:23 <+fstd_> no
23:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why
23:24 <+fstd_> that shortcut is for people who are sure
23:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's stupid to close game that way xD
23:24 <+fstd_> there are enough slow ways to close the game already
23:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but, i didn't even know about such a shortcut
23:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and it's bound
23:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> by default
23:24 <+fstd_> it's not bound, it's hardcoded i think
23:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> awesome
23:24 <+fstd_> and yes, you weren't supposed to know about it and it never hurt you :-)
23:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> thank you, now I will destroy
23:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> all of my runs
23:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because you told me about that shortcut :?
23:25 <+fstd_> you're welcome
