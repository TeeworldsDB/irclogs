01:57 <@deen> Anyone want to look over? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/251#issuecomment-133213045
01:59 <@deen> otherwise i'll probably implement that when i feel like it
02:00 <@deen> EastByte: big ddos on GER, your tcp protection isn't working
02:00 <@deen> i guess because the attacks don't follow the tcp protocol :P
02:02 <@deen> they don't send a SYN, just an ACK
02:02 <@deen> hi vlxark 
02:03 < vlxark> heyllo
02:03 <@deen> how can i help you? haven't seen you here before
02:03 < vlxark> just ircing
02:05 <@deen> and they attack the port of the old block server
13:09 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] east pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vsR6Q
13:09 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 79a523e east: websocket support fixed
13:37 < Learath2> we do link to some ssl library where do you think i could get the headers for it ?
13:55 <@deen> oh, we should include the headers in the ddnet distribution
13:56 <@deen> or not, i'm not sure
13:56 <@deen> it's 0.9.8 openssl
13:58 <@EastByte> ah, right I wanted to do that aswell, openssl is pretty powerful
13:59 <@EastByte> is 0.9.8 an old version?
14:04 < Learath2> well the windows dll seems to be 1.0.0k
14:05 < Learath2> i want to try updating a dll but i dont remember how to setup the update stuff
14:07 < fstd> in order to setup the update stuff you must first update the setup stuff
14:11 < Learath2> thx
14:11 <@heinrich5991> how was that helpful?
14:12 < fstd> your sarcasm sensors are miscalibrated
14:12 < Learath2> :D
14:12 <@heinrich5991> oh :)
14:12 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: do you play hots?
14:15 < Learath2> hots ?
14:15 <@heinrich5991> yet another dota :) heroes of the storm
14:16 <@heinrich5991> (by blizzard)
14:16 < Learath2> nope
14:16 < tyurderi> hi, anyone here who is very familiar using git?
14:16 <@heinrich5991> yes, definitely :)
14:16  * Learath2 is quite decent
14:17 < tyurderi> nice. is there a way to compare my local git project with a git project on another remote server?
14:18 <@heinrich5991> git fetch URL
14:18 <@heinrich5991> git diff HEAD FETCH_HEAD
14:18 < tyurderi> how the url should looks like?
14:19 <@heinrich5991> git://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds master
14:19 < tyurderi> ok also
14:19 < tyurderi> git fetch git://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds teeworlds_master
14:19 < tyurderi> git diff master teeworlds_master
14:19 < tyurderi> ?
14:20 <@heinrich5991> no
14:20 <@heinrich5991> git fetch git://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds master
14:20 <@heinrich5991> git diff HEAD FETCH_HEAD
14:20 < tyurderi> HEAD HEAD_FETCH is a placeholder, right?
14:21 < tyurderi> or not?
14:21 < Learath2> not
14:21 < tyurderi> ah ok
14:21 < tyurderi> thank you very much :)
14:22 < tyurderi> oh.. well. what about when i have a *.git file to compare with a project on another remote server?
14:23 < Learath2> that .git isnt a file its a folder on the remote server
14:24 < tyurderi> oh
14:24 < tyurderi> thank you
14:24 < tyurderi> my fault
14:25 < tyurderi> i would test it now with the teeworlds repository on github... should i make a backup of my project before testing it? its not familar with teeworlds or anything similar.
14:27 <@heinrich5991> you can execute these git diff and git fetch commands without fear of deleting anything
14:29 < tyurderi> ok im currently in my *.git folder. git fetch worked fine but when i try "git diff HEAD HEAD_MASTER" i get the following error: fatal: ambiguous argument 'HEAD_FETCH': unknown revision or path not in the working tree. Use '--' to separate paths from revisions
14:30 <@heinrich5991> git diff HEAD FETCH_HEAD
14:30 <@heinrich5991> input literally this command
14:31 < tyurderi> oh, well. thank you very much :)!
14:32 < o_be_one> hellow
14:32 < tyurderi> o_be_one = o_tee_one?
14:33 < armani> yo
14:50 < o_be_one> tyurderi: yes its me
14:50 < o_be_one> salut armani ça roule ?
16:06 <@deen> I'll not be online for a month in 1.5 months: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2085
16:07 < o_be_one> oh :(
16:08 < o_be_one> will be really long time :o !
16:08 <@deen> east can release maps and fix the servers
16:08 < o_be_one> what is the admin work ?
16:09 <@EastByte> so many trips o.o
16:09 < o_be_one> "the idea is that they (or some other reasonable people) do most of the work"
16:09 <@deen> and the other admins can discuss and do things as well, should work somehow^^
16:09 <@EastByte> deen: why do you travel so much?
16:09 <@deen> EastByte: why not?!
16:09 <@EastByte> okay I get it :p
16:09 < o_be_one> omg and you dont visit France ? ................
16:10 <@deen> o_be_one: i've been in france before, i mostly chose countries i haven't been in^^
16:10 < o_be_one> oh ok
16:10 < o_be_one> so spain you did it too ?
16:10 <@deen> spain was planned, but then i remembered that i have to attend a wedding, haha
16:10 < tyurderi> also someone available who is very familar with nginx?
16:11 <@deen> o_be_one: this kind of tasks:
16:11 <@deen>     Check the forum for maps to be released and add them to the Planned Releases [=> Currently being planned by hi_leute_gll, Knight, Soreu]
16:11 <@deen>     Check the forum for bugs and suggestions and fix, try to implement or add them to github issues. Or at least answer why it won't be done.
16:11 <@deen>     Release maps and update map fixes on server [=> east?]
16:11 <@deen>     Organize Tournaments (maybe, it's a lot of work and needs Linux and LOTS of improvisation skills, maybe we should just stop them altogether)
16:11 <@deen>     Be the first person that gets talked to when something is wrong with DDNet servers, client, behaviour of other players, etc
16:11 <@deen>     Decide community stuff [=> all admins together?]
16:11 <@deen>     Decide development stuff [=> east?]
16:11 <@deen>     Maintain the website [=> Soreu, Savander?]
16:12 < o_be_one> dat trip is awesome deen hope you'll enjoy it, but youll waste many time in transport no ? :o
16:12 <@deen> o_be_one: yeah, need books :P
16:12 < tyurderi> @deen: about the website i would help too
16:12 <@deen> but i love books, so no problem
16:13 < o_be_one> i think you cant stop tournament, but you have to tell someone how it works everytime, and what kind of problems he can meet
16:13 <@deen> and without luggage you only have to be at the airport 30 min prior to the flight
16:14 <@deen> o_be_one: different problems every time and complicated solutions^^
16:14 < o_be_one> i can act for community stuff and be one of the first person to get talked when something is wrong
16:14 < o_be_one> yes but you have to do a known trouble i think
16:14 <@EastByte> stop being one :p
16:14 < o_be_one> even if it will not be again
16:14 <@deen> o_be_one: hm, i don't know if any non-block players know you?
16:14 <@EastByte> I already told some people to blame me via skype
16:14 < o_be_one> you go without lugage ? oO
16:15 <@deen> o_be_one: backpack
16:15 < o_be_one> deen: as ive already told to you, many ddracers are in blockers too ..
16:15 <@EastByte> deen: saavik thinks now I'm the new deen
16:15 < o_be_one> i know most of US players, and some of EUR players, but my Skype says to much information sometime x)
16:15 <@deen> EastByte: haha, sorry for all the insults you'll get from people =/
16:16 < o_be_one> EastByte: hey "new-deen" :D
16:16 <@EastByte> no insults yet :)
16:16 < o_be_one> lol deen you get insults i think to cause players doesnt really understand you and thinks that you are alone to make decision for ddnet
16:16 < o_be_one> and that you dont care on what they think
16:17 <@deen> also, I'll be going on a solo bicycle camping trip now, should be back tomorrow, bye
16:17 <@EastByte> cya
16:17 < o_be_one> they just dont know you and don't understand how you do many things for them
16:17 <@EastByte> have fun!
16:17 < o_be_one> for them, its like "normal"
16:17 < o_be_one> deen see ya :)
16:18 < o_be_one> how much costs a trip like that oO ?
16:20 <@EastByte> without luggage and staying maybe not so much
16:20 <@EastByte> hm, doing such trips is not what I imagine to do in my free time
16:21 < o_be_one> some people enjoy these kind of trip
16:21 <@EastByte> well maybe I would make trips to different datacenters and place raspberry pis everywhere :)
16:24 <@deen> o_be_one: 298 €
16:25 <@EastByte> yea, that's not much
16:27 < o_be_one> really ? thats nothing, and about hosting ? Friends ? AirBNB ?
16:28 <@deen> o_be_one: no plans yet, will see^^
16:28 < o_be_one> ahah EastByte :D ! ive meet the OVH first Canadian DC last week 8-)
16:28 < o_be_one> lol deen meet girls :p thats the better sleep time you'll get 8-)
16:29 < o_be_one> did ive shown you what is 176 cores server :d ? http://i.imgur.com/pzOb3O6.png & http://i.imgur.com/eydySvY.png & http://i.imgur.com/aRA4Yx4.jpg
16:29 <@deen> yes
16:29 < o_be_one> ahah ^^
17:10 < armani> o_be_one: power 8 cpu ?
17:10 < o_be_one> yep armani 
17:10 < o_be_one> 22 coeurs en Power8 :D
17:19 < armani> does it run powerkvm or bare linux ?
17:20 < o_be_one> euh .. Screens are from Ubuntu 14.04 ppc, running in RunAbove OpenStack via QEMU
17:21 < armani> ok
17:21 < o_be_one> but the VM is alone in the dedicated hardware
17:21 < o_be_one> so nothing is share with other VM with this one
17:21 < armani> ok
17:25 < o_be_one> fstd: ?
17:25 < o_be_one> you know that OpenStack and many opensource projects use .sh for bash scripts too ?
17:29 < armani> what do you mean ?
17:29 < armani>  /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash ?
17:30 < armani> I think it is for portability, many linux distribution alias it to bash
17:31 < Edible> its still wrong
17:31 < armani> wrong ?
17:31 < Edible> using .sh when you actually mean .bash
17:31 < armani> depending on your shebang
17:32 < armani> file ext mean nothing in unix land
17:32 < Edible> vim doesnt read shebang, it identifies the file via extension
17:32 < armani> that is wrong
17:33 < armani> that is file guessing, it is other thing
17:33 < Edible> exactly, unix land. not linux land, which is strictly bash based
17:33 < Edible> bsd land uses sh
17:33 < Edible> and you as a user need to guess which sh is what
17:33 < armani> note: I'm an openbsd guy & dev
17:34 < armani> note2: ksh over sh
17:34 < Edible> and how do you determine what scripts uses what?
17:34 < armani> shebang is the way to go
17:35 < Edible> isnt it easier to go by extension when you ls ?
17:35 < Edible> so you will open a file just to see that?
17:35 < Edible> thats quite tedious
17:35 < armani> that how unix works
17:36 < armani> I mean, you can have a lol.py who is in fact a shell script
17:36 < armani> and doing ./lol.py just works
17:36 < armani> I miss the initial point, you do prefer having file name script.bash over script.sh ?
17:36 < Edible> yes
17:36 < armani> I would say if you want scrict compat, just use pure sh + .sh
17:37 < o_be_one> ive worked for big companys, they shebang bash and name .sh
17:37 < Edible> i like knowing what exactly a shellscript is, is it fish? ksh? mksh? sh? dash? zsh?
17:37 < o_be_one> first time seen people worrying about this
17:37 < armani> I do agree that thinking you will have bash everywhere is wrong
17:37 < Edible> and a thousand others
17:38 < Edible> especially when you are looking at someone's repository over github, and you see the files and think "ok i have all the dependencies" and turns out, no, you dont
17:38 < o_be_one> for a one user linux its not a problem, an admin will dev always with the language he knows best. But for shared linux, could be interesting to know directly by the name
17:38 < o_be_one> but noone do that, event in managed environment where ive worked (for nissan for example, and many other big companys)
17:38 < Edible> sometimes linux folk forget to mention that they arent using sh, but bash.
17:39 < o_be_one> oh yes thats a good point about git, i must update my scripts, ty :)
17:39 < Edible> #!/bin/sh isnt actually /bin/sh
17:40 < Edible> :)
17:41 < armani> yeah but it is sh compatible
17:41 < Edible> bash? yeah, you have that ability, but sooner or later you're gonna break that compatibility and use a bashism
17:42 < armani> so you put bin/sh if you do plain sh
17:42 < armani> so you put /bin/bash :)
17:43 < armani> I always do head -1 / file on sh script 
17:43 < fstd> bash will pretend to be sh when run as /bin/sh, and even on many linuxes /bin/sh is actually ash or dash
17:43 < armani> yeah still not a problem if you do plain sh
17:43 < fstd> o_be_one: and yes, i know that a lot of people do that
17:43 < fstd> of course not, IMO it's a huge failure to use bash for scripting at all
17:44 < armani> agree
17:44 < Edible> what would you use instead?
17:44 < armani> anyway, ext is part of the filename
17:44 < fstd> i'd stick to the shell language defined by POSIX
17:44 < armani> filename is user choose
17:44 < armani> do whatever you want ;)
17:44 < fstd> and use any posix-compatible non-sluggish shell
17:45 < armani> yes
17:46 < Edible> yes but its not like POSIX gets updated, sh doesnt support arrays, and sometimes you need that
17:46 < fstd> you have the positional parameters which catch most use cases for arrays
17:47 < fstd> fwiw i have rarely seen a case where some bashism was actually required
17:48 < armani> http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.sbin/rcctl/rcctl.sh?rev=1.79&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup Edible 
17:48 < Edible> (i can't believe I'm arguing for bash (in some cases), i'll probably barf soon)
17:48 < fstd> and of course posix gets updated, but fortunately not all too often.  who wants a standard that is a moving target? :)
17:48 < o_be_one> fstd: so you mean sh ?
17:48 < o_be_one> bash community is big :/
17:48 < fstd> o_be_one: i mean any shell that understands http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html
17:48 < fstd> most shells do
17:49 < o_be_one> its like linux nazi :D
17:49 < fstd> the benefit of sticking to that language is that your scripts will be portable and work in any other posix shell
17:49 < fstd> (which means you can stop using bash for them and suddenly your scripts aren't slow as hell anymore ;))
17:51 < armani> fstd: do you know one interpreter that really need -o posix to be really complient ?
17:51 < Edible> is bash really that slow?
17:52 < fstd> armani: i'm not sure if i know one interpreter that is *truly* compliant at all:).  not entirely sure, though
17:52 < fstd> Edible: well, look at the memory footprint, look at the fact that they've reimplemented all sorts of stuff as builtins because it was so slow
17:53 < o_be_one> yes but its like discussing about systemd ...
17:53 < armani> openbsd sh seems mainly compliant
17:53 < armani> The sh utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (``POSIX.1'') specification, except where noted below:The sh utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (``POSIX.1'') specification, except where noted below:
17:53 < o_be_one> yes systemd is not unix compatible and ?
17:53 < armani> ahah
17:53 < fstd> i think with full use of bashisms, bash scripts can run resonably fast, but then they aren't portable anymore
17:53 < armani> I hate bashism so mush
17:53 < o_be_one> Edible: idk, but IBM uses Bash too ...
17:53 < fstd> o_be_one: i don't see how this is like arguing over systemd, IMO bash has its place, but as an interactive shell
17:53 < o_be_one> (yeah, ive worked at IBM too)
17:54 < armani> has a bsd user installing bash to compile / install some program is a pain
17:54 < Edible> and not even that, because fish is way better
17:54 < Edible> as an interactive shell
17:54 < o_be_one> fish :D ?
17:54 < o_be_one> i want fist shell 86)
17:54 < o_be_one> 8-)
17:54 < Edible> friendly interactive shell
17:54 < o_be_one> just to do fist scripts for fstd :D
17:55 < o_be_one> nice name, i'll take a look, i'm a bit curious, i think ive seen in on korbens blog
17:55 < Edible> fstd, memory footprint, but if it has things like cut as a builtin, it saves time whenever you use cut, because you wont fork
17:55 < armani> oh no please, not the systemd debate (:
17:56 < o_be_one> (x
17:56 < Edible> so it becomes more of a pick your poison thing, memory over cpu
17:56 < armani> wait, are we really speaking about a fork system call time in a shell script ?
17:56 < armani> :)
17:56 < Edible> im only thinking here, i never heard bash reimplemented the unix toolset as a builtin
17:56 < fstd> Edible: yes, indeed.  and the fact that they've created such builtins shows that they've had a performance issue; while those new builtins themselves cause portability issues unless they're carefully designed after the posix spec, which i don't trust the bash devs to care about
17:57 < armani> sh is not webscale !
17:57 < fstd> lol
17:58 < armani> or maybe bash implemented a JIT ? 
17:58 < Edible> why would they cause portability issues? you know you're using bash, and you know you're using anything that bash comes up with
17:58 < fstd> we clearly need sh.js
17:58 < fstd> Edible: yes, and hence you're bash-specific
17:58 < Edible> exactly!
17:59 < fstd> and hence you're not portable to systems that don't use bash, or perhaps even use a (substantially) different version of bash
17:59 < Edible> it was my point at the beginning, bash is already not sh, which is why you need to be explicit in its use
17:59 < fstd> i fully agree with that
17:59 < fstd> but i'd prefer not using it over that, even :)
17:59 < Edible> THEN WE AGREE DAMNIT (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
18:00 < Edible> :)
18:00 < fstd> wait, we can't have that.
18:00 < fstd> ;)
18:00 < Edible> yes
18:00 < Edible> lets go back to systemd
18:00 < Edible> :P
18:01 < armani> wait 
18:01 < fstd> yeah, i shall resume my work on systembsd, the BSD-port of systemd
18:01 < Edible> i think the debate was more on, should anyone bother with file extensions in unix
18:01 < armani> I do not agree with you char encoding
18:01 < armani> fstd: you worked on systembsd ?
18:01 < Learath2> dont think that exists
18:02 < Learath2> oh it exists :D
18:02 < Edible> o_be_one, http://fishshell.com/
18:02 < o_be_one> yes ive seen
18:02 < o_be_one> ill try in some minutes :D
18:02 < o_be_one> im really curious and it seems good
18:02 < fstd> armani: i noticed the superior design of systemd and figured we need that in NetBSD land
18:02 < fstd> i figure the other BSDs will pick it up
18:02 < Edible> the great thing is, you wont even need to configure it o_be_one, it works out of the box
18:03 < o_be_one> awesome :D
18:03 < o_be_one> ive my bashrc since a while now, but im not closed to new things
18:03 < armani> fstd: heh openbsd started it first at a gsoc ! :p
18:04 < armani> fstd: so you can fully enjoy you gnome user experience !
18:04 < Edible> its a bit buggy though, last time i tried
18:04 < fstd> hooray!
18:05 < armani> fstd: so you are the netbsd user ?
18:05 < o_be_one> Edible: fishshell ?
18:05 < armani> fstd: ok enougth troll for today, even if it is friday
18:05 < o_be_one> is it fish day x) ?
18:06 < fstd> armani: it's quite a coincidence that the netbsd user and the openbsd user happen to meet in a small IRC channel on quakenet, right? ;)
18:06 < fstd> if only both freebsd users were here, we could make a great BSD party
18:06 < armani> fstd: maybe because that the only game we have ? 
18:08 < fstd> what, teeworlds?
18:08 < fstd> i play superbeastiekart every day, m8
18:08 < armani> :)
18:08 < o_be_one> ok trying fish shell
18:08 < o_be_one> funny
18:08 < o_be_one> i can just type the name of the folder and it goes in x)
18:08 < armani> fstd: wait, netbsd has a graphic stack ?
18:09 < o_be_one> thats really nice for noob :D
18:09 < fstd> yeah, and as of late, it actually works!
18:09 < Edible> can you guys use a joystick?
18:09 < fstd> high-res console and all
18:09 < armani> fstd: even on amiga ?
18:10 < fstd> i think they've implemented 4K support on amiga lately.  gotta overclock 'em CRTs a bit, but who cares
18:10  * fstd bbl food
18:42 < fstd> btw i think file extensions still serve as a useful reminder of what sort of file one's dealing with
18:48 < Chairn> found an embarassing bug
18:48 < Chairn> we saved a game but  2 players were on end tiles
18:48 < Chairn> and one got a time
18:48 < Chairn> but when we reloaded and ended again, he got another time
18:49 <@EastByte> :/
18:49 < Chairn> we didnt manage to reproduce it by resaving and reloading
18:49 < Chairn> http://ddnet.tw/players/Habibi57/
18:49 < Chairn> as you can see, 2 times, of 70mins+ with only 11 mins between
18:51 < Chairn> and i dont know why, but my personal best on ddnet client end with .81 instead of .82
18:51 <@EastByte> Savander: Jaw'Eld is your map right?
18:52 < o_be_one> hey habibi :D
18:53 < Chairn> http://i18.servimg.com/u/f18/11/55/83/62/screen10.jpg weird?
18:54 <@EastByte> yea
18:56 < Savander> EastByte, yes
18:57 <@EastByte> will release in ~15 minutes
18:58 < Savander> yay ;3
19:31 < Nimda> Jaw'Eld by Savander just released on Brutal at 2015-08-21 19:24
19:33 <@EastByte> I think that was my first release without making any mistake
19:34 < Savander> :D
19:35 < Savander> nice !
19:55 < Savander> east
19:58 < Elbide> as long as we dont have a tag based fs as main, you gotta use file extensions\
20:00 < Learath2> EastByte: you around ?
20:00 <@EastByte> yea
20:01 < Learath2> Im trying to work out a way to setup authentication for an account system
20:03 <@EastByte> "a way to setup"
20:03 <@EastByte> so you want to make an account system?
20:03 < Learath2> yeah but just drawing ideas for now
20:03 <@EastByte> okay cool
20:03 < Savander> EastByte,  could yo restart map d?
20:04 <@EastByte> I recently worked on the idea to do client<->client authentification using /whisper
20:04 < Learath2> im thinking more of an authentication server which could also allow client <-> client whispering without the game server inbetween
20:09 <@EastByte> Learath2: then you need a third way of communicating
20:10 <@EastByte> (a third instance I mean)
20:10 <@EastByte> how do you want to transport client <-> client transfer?
20:10 < Learath2> I was trying to say a seperate server that is not the gameserver
20:11 < Learath2> so someone can send a whisper across servers
20:11 <@EastByte> well that's what I guessed
20:11 <@EastByte> p2p would be a bad idea
20:12 < Learath2> so what i have drawn up is the auth server has a pubkey which the client will use to encrypt username, pass, and a secret
20:13 < Learath2> if the user and pass is a match the auth server will store the secret which can now be passed to the game server which can verify it with the auth server
20:13 < Learath2> the only thing im worried about is a rogue server logging the secret which is valid for the whole session
20:17 < Learath2> i think ill encrypt the secret with auth servers pubkey too but then the thing is i need someone changing in that message so that someone cant just log the encrypted secret and replay it
20:25 <@EastByte> hmm, a bit complicated
20:29 <@EastByte> Learath2: did you also make plans to keep the auth server decentral?
20:29 <@EastByte> wouldn't make sense to have another attack vector in the tw scene
20:31 < Learath2> well no idea how to have a decentralized auth server
20:32 <@EastByte> multiple synchronising servers
20:33 <@EastByte> hard to implement from scratch of course
20:33 < Learath2> sure if we have the servers shouldnt be that hard to setup
20:34 < Learath2> i dont want any sensitive data being sent to the gameserver so gameserver should be able to verify that i have the account i claim to have
20:34 < Learath2> if you have a less compilcated way or a way to plug the hole in mine im all ears
20:36 <@EastByte> it would be simpler to just use the gameserver to communicate
20:37 <@EastByte> has some disadvantages though
20:37 < Learath2> well that gives the gameserver login information and we lose the ability to not be connected to any server and login send whispers etc
20:38 <@EastByte> "that gives the gameserver login information" what do you mean?
20:38 <@EastByte> what's login information
20:39 < Learath2> one way or the other in some form we have to give the gameserver username and password which means a rogue server can log that
20:40 < Learath2> or we need some way of knowing which servers we can trust
20:40 <@EastByte> why not just using the certificate/public key as account?
20:40 <@EastByte> without account server
20:42 < Learath2> who has the private key in that case ?
20:42 <@EastByte> the user
20:43 < Learath2> would make using the account system for anything other then tw infeasible
20:43 < Learath2> and given the age average of 12 people would lose accounts all the time
20:43 < Learath2> and not everyone is technical
20:45 <@EastByte> well I just ignored that facts
20:46 < Learath2> that was my initial idea as well
20:46 <@EastByte> if an account gets lost players just have to generate a new one and prove somehow that's still them
20:47 < Learath2> well email verification should be good enough to get a new certificate to someone
20:47 <@EastByte> probably
20:50 <@EastByte> maybe that's the wrong way to go, but we want it simple and it's about a game
20:50 <@EastByte> (a free opensource game)
20:50 < Learath2> well username and password is simple enough for users
20:51 <@EastByte> by simple I mean in development
20:51 <@EastByte> for username and password you'll always need another database/serever
20:51 <@EastByte> server*
20:51 < Learath2> well most of the things we can do with an account system needs a server
20:52 <@EastByte> the gameserver is already there
20:54 < Learath2> well we still need somekind of database of public keys
20:54 <@EastByte> a local one for friendlist and one on serverside which is mod dependent
20:55 < Learath2> well how would you check if one of the local pubkeys are online
20:56 <@EastByte> not possible
20:56 < Learath2> mmh i really would like to keep this seperated from the gameserver
20:56 <@EastByte> but I made my approach mostly for identification / verification of ingame players/friends
20:57 <@EastByte> you want a general account system
20:57 < Learath2> yep
20:57 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: account system wasn't planned for 0.7 right?
20:57 <@EastByte> :p
21:00 < o_be_one> but TeamSpeak works with cert and users deal with it ..
21:00 < Learath2> teamspeak works with uniqueid's
21:00 < Learath2> mumble works with certs
21:00 < o_be_one> generated by certificate
21:00 < o_be_one> well uniqueid could do the job too
21:01 < Savander> EastByte, 
21:01 < Savander> on GER2
21:01 < Savander> times isn't the same
21:01 < Savander> as on GER
21:01 < Savander> i mean, 
21:01 < Savander> beast and bibi finished map
21:01 < Savander> on GER it is
21:01 < Savander> but on GER2 it isn't
21:01 < Savander> but we finished map on GER2, and on GER this record exists
21:02 <@EastByte> seems like the dbs aren't synchronized
21:02 <@EastByte> GER2 has some problems I noticed
21:04 <@EastByte> deen: any idea about GER2?
21:04 < Savander> :)
21:05 <@EastByte> afk
21:26 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: no it isn't 
21:26 <@heinrich5991> but I also think that TS's authentication system is the way to go
21:26 <@heinrich5991> it has some key pair which uniquely identifies a user
21:27 < o_be_one> +1
22:14 <@EastByte> +1
22:16 <@EastByte> hm the last ddos attack came at 2am
22:18 <@EastByte> o_be_one: 
22:18 <@EastByte> o_be_one | im not getting a DDoS, but my game server is like in ddos Oo
22:18 <@EastByte> o_be_one | is it antispoof problem ?
22:18 <@EastByte> still trying to find out what the cause is
22:19 <@EastByte> two players told me about that issue aswell
