07:54 < bridge> <ZombieToad> Hello again @deen @Learath2 @snail @murpi @bencie i have been banned again for "constant racism" while i have not said anything racist in the past 2 weeks
07:55 < bridge> <ZombieToad> i ask once more for you to look into this error it is very upsetting for me not being able to play my favourite game
07:55 < bridge> <murpi> That's not how bans work, you're not allowed to play until the date shown in the ban reason
07:56 < bridge> <ZombieToad> but i have been banned in error?
07:56 < bridge> <ZombieToad> i thougt an admin had removed the previous ban since i was able to connect again
07:59 < bridge> <murpi> I can assure you no admin or moderator removed your ban and your ban hasn't reset either, so unless you can proof you're innocent, refrain from playing on our servers.
08:01 < bridge> <ZombieToad> is this a joke? prove my innocence?
08:01 < bridge> <ZombieToad> provide me teehistorian then i will
08:03 < bridge> <ZombieToad> this seems like a personal hatred against me from vy0x and murpi
08:04 < bridge> <murpi> feel free to complain to any other admin, preferably in a DM on your alt
08:05 < bridge> <ZombieToad> hating others will only make your live more negative. you should respect everyone
08:05 < bridge> <ZombieToad> hating others will only make your life more negative. you should respect everyone
08:06 < bridge> <murpi> I have not shown any disrespect towards you.
08:07 < bridge> <ZombieToad> saying im guilty until proven innocent is disrespect
08:28 < bridge> <Ewan> at least show him where he was racist
08:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> #freesomeone
08:36 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Or send proof!
08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> agree
08:38 < bridge> <Vy0x2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1094511581452304415/image.png
08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> is that not you
08:38 < bridge> <Vy0x2> no
08:38 < bridge> <Ewan> why u racist
08:38 < bridge> <Vy0x2> #off-topic
08:39 < bridge> <Ewan> sp cant talk there
08:39 < bridge> <Ewan> no bridge
08:39 < bridge> <Vy0x2> he doesnt need to
08:39 < bridge> <Ewan> üòÇ
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if someone needs "cheap" vps or domains, netcup has easter event running:
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u dont want to search the eggs on their site
09:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://camelus.eu/netcup/
09:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this year i dont find the offers very attractive
09:28 < bridge> <Ewan> handy
09:34 <+ChillerDragon> omg jopsti i just bought a vps w out discount there latley
09:34 <+ChillerDragon> GOTTA BUY A CUP!
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> don't see any great deals here
09:39 < bridge> <Ewan> but the table is hard to make sense of
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> i assume 10% disciount on the vps 2000 is permanent https://www.netcup.de/vserver/vps.php
09:40 <+ChillerDragon> so 12 bucks a month for 8core 12gb ram 320ssd
09:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep its permanent
09:41 <+ChillerDragon> im sure jopsi just has referal contract w netcuppo
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but has 12 months min contract time
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> ez
09:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u also have to buy it form the easter egg
09:42 <+ChillerDragon> not sure if i would buy it its still more expensive than my 6euro contract currently
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah its also rather overkill if u just want to host teeworlds xD
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> there is no such thing as overkill
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> my vpses always are at 100% cpu usage
09:43 <+ChillerDragon> if tw and all the other crap doesnt cut it i render blender images and mine bitcoin xd
09:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there was VPS 500 for 5‚Ç¨ smth with more SSD.. but storage is not really helpful xD
09:44 <+ChillerDragon> my mc server needs 2tb
09:44 <+ChillerDragon> but its full so it actually would need more
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> eastern 2019 was nice, vps for under 2‚Ç¨
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> poggies
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> i assume vps 200 then
09:45 <+ChillerDragon> but still a nice contract
09:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the current generation has 1 more core , so its not comparable anymore
09:46 <+ChillerDragon> i mean inflation alone could justify a base price of 10ct for vps 200 in 2019
09:46 <+ChillerDragon> xd
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd like to have upgraded xD
09:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> jopsi wanna buy a datacenter together?
09:47 <+ChillerDragon> i got 10 bucks left this month

09:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if (is_zero_day(packet)) { send("nice try") }
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> ou nice patch!
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> is it forward compatible?
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes it will work for eternity
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> good stuff
09:50 <+ChillerDragon> jopsti just solved cyber security
09:58 < bridge> <Ewan> fantastic
09:59 <+ChillerDragon> ay dj jopsti send your gaming and coding playlist or riot
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mostly hear
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Anime Ost
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Game Ost
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Classic music
10:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And pretty much only instrumental
10:00 < bridge> <Ewan> üëÅÔ∏è
10:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But if u want a playlist i can create one later
10:01 < bridge> <Ewan> where is the chillerdragon playlist
10:02 <+ChillerDragon> i dont do music
10:03 <+ChillerDragon> @Ewan if i had one i wouldnt have to ask for other ppl playlists xd
10:03 < bridge> <Ewan> usually people do it to share music
10:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'll create one later chillerdragores
10:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i have a few of my friends' playlists saved just to see what they are up to music-wise
10:03 <+ChillerDragon> i just always get stuck in the recommendation loop of 3 songs on yt and spotify
10:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then u can hear most epic gamer coder music ever
10:04 <+ChillerDragon> nice
10:04 <+ChillerDragon> i enter "anime ost" on spotify in the meantime and get crackin
10:04 < bridge> <Ewan> oh jeez
10:51 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 any chance you could not abstract away the size fields for data fields in the dissector?
10:52 <+ChillerDragon> in front of the data field there is a size field which you also consume but you do so silently https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/7885c99974ee445ce13297b72ae3e7c6ea3b969d/gamenet/generate/spec/teeworlds-0.7.5.json#L957
10:53 <+ChillerDragon> this read_int seems to be not reflected in wireshark https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/7885c99974ee445ce13297b72ae3e7c6ea3b969d/packer/src/lib.rs#L223
10:53 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1681030404.png
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> when looking at this to understand the protocol one could think parsing a snap is just 3 times get_int followed by 1 time get_raw while in reality its 4 times get_int
10:55 <+ChillerDragon> when clicking on the annotations you basically hide the size field in the data field
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> also heinrich do i ping you too often with annoying stuff? xd lemme know if i should stop 
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon\: man i heard so much stuff i liked i really cannot tell how much i forgot in my list xD
11:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this might be a rough estimate

13:46 < bridge> <Patiga> ```
13:46 < bridge> <Patiga> is not valid rust code o.o
13:46 < bridge> <Patiga> and it has a super confusing error message
13:46 < bridge> <Patiga> I was able to reduce it down to https://godbolt.org/z/31EPcsWsM
13:47 < bridge> <Patiga> apparently it is a known limitation
13:47 < bridge> <k2d222> wth
13:48 < bridge> <k2d222> what is the known limitation?
13:48 < bridge> <Patiga> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72783
13:49 < bridge> <Patiga> eh you can hop between multiple issues, it goes way back to 2013
13:49 < bridge> <k2d222> eh I guess its a bug of the compiler but not the spec ?
13:50 < bridge> <k2d222> it looks very simple and reasonable to do so, crazy
13:51 < bridge> <Patiga> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/7909
13:51 < bridge> <Patiga> yea the code feels super natural
13:52 < bridge> <Patiga> the suggestion of the compiler on the second error message does indeed fix it, putting parentheses around the `match` expression
13:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ohh its a syntax error
13:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> dereference operator
14:00 < bridge> <k2d222> well to me it looks like the syntax tree would be correctly defined as `binop_expr = (expr) * (expr) = (block_exp) * (num_literal)`
14:00 < bridge> <k2d222> I don't see what's difficult to parse here, but obviously the rust team is more clever and knowledgeable than me XD
14:02 < bridge> <Patiga> ah and ¬¥let a = { 1 } * 1;` works
14:03 < bridge> <k2d222> to me it's even weirder that it doesn't work with the match, as the parser should immediately 'know' that it's an expression when it sees the match kw
14:03 <+ChillerDragon> rust moment
14:04 < bridge> <k2d222> none of your python trivia beat this XD
14:04 <+ChillerDragon> xd
14:04 < bridge> <gerdoe> yeah better make rust trivia based on rust templating xd

14:12 < bridge> <Patiga> yea its not even about the downloads. you can go down that list and find so many crates you have used yourself directly or indirectly
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf is that xD
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i thought rust is clear af for nobo like me
15:59 < bridge> <Patiga> honestly same until I learned of the quiz :d
16:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its made for obscure stuff
16:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its normal to not know
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its still questionable if its so unintuitive lol
16:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> given a sufficiently complex lang this is bound to happen
16:36 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its nice they explain is so detailed lol
16:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i feel stupid now
19:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats good
19:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> knowing everything is boring
19:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks another thing i found if i recall correctly and std does it a lot
19:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> since inlining generic functions needs to preserve the body function
19:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that can take more compile time
19:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so a optimization is to make a generic function that wraps a non generic one
19:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so the body is the smallest possible
19:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the std does this extensively
19:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://matklad.github.io/2021/07/09/inline-in-rust.html

21:45 < bridge> <Devinci> Those aren't official servers. So i guess they can do whatever they want.
21:45 < bridge> <Devinci> Officials are the ones with a blue check (or the ddnet / kog tab)
21:47 < bridge> <El Yek> There are cases of servers for faking players on the server are banned in the masterserver
21:47 < bridge> <El Yek> Look
21:47 < bridge> <El Yek> https://status.tw/master/bans/
21:47 < bridge> <Vy0x2> Also community servers have to follow some rules
21:49 < bridge> <Vy0x2> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10442
21:49 < bridge> <Devinci> O rly? Can I find them somewhere?
21:49 < bridge> <Devinci> Ah, thanks
21:49 < bridge> <Devinci> Makes sense
21:50 < bridge> <El Yek> It seems that the hoster saw this channel because they automatically stopped faking and now the server is empty
