16:31 < Shishigami> hi, are there contributing / code style guidelines anywhere?
16:32 <@EastByte> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=nomenclature
16:32 < Shishigami> tyvm
16:34 < Shishigami> is there a way to print the command that is executed by a keybinding (besides dump_binds)?
16:35 < Henningstone> not yet implemented
16:35 < Shishigami> I made an implementation but not sure if relevant https://github.com/marcelherd/ddnet/commit/1f5859503329717b3f633b9331b353db133ca021
16:37 < Henningstone> this does not check whether there is anything at all bound to the key, does it?
16:41 < Shishigami> it does not, if the key is unbound it will print  key (int) = nothinghere
16:42 < Henningstone> yeah not that much of a big problem, just not too fancy if you know what I mean :)
16:42 < Shishigami> will fix
16:58 < Shishigami> im not too familiar with c, would this be the proper way? strlen(pBinds->m_aaKeyBindings[id]) == 0 // key is bound to empty string
16:59 < Henningstone> in teeworlds you would use 'str_length', but you can simply check if(pBinds->m_aaKeyBindings[id][0] == '\0')
17:00 < Henningstone> since the strings are zero-terminated, when the first character is a zero-byte, the string must be empty
17:03 < Shishigami> aight, thanks, I updated it: https://github.com/marcelherd/ddnet/commit/b09bcb90a35ec2ea99023da0f9e8d465925aec31
18:03 < Learath2> Shishigami: only one thing left allman style brackets
18:36 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] marcelherd opened pull request #613: Feature/printbind (master...feature/printbind) https://git.io/vDJN1
19:54 < c0d3d3v> Nice feature :)
20:36 < Shishigami> x)
