08:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is the ddnet banner there without clicking v
08:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
08:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the banner is always there
08:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we need that too
08:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> banner hot
08:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet logo ugly
08:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot
08:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah banner cool
08:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
08:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> default tees with orange brown colors are not ugly?
08:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes 
08:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it should have some twinbops etc then it would look better
08:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
08:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not ugly
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lets not sexualize ddnet banner
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> twinbops is top3 most sexualized default skins
08:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it not brand safe
08:50 < ws-client1> <tester> wait wot where am i

08:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dunno bout that
08:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> its still not perfect
08:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but good direction
08:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> too many colors
08:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
08:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> black cat is overkill
08:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> he also didnt make it as logo tbf
08:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> shit why it posted here
08:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont even know what u mean
08:52 <+ChillerDragon> oh boi thanks
08:53 <+ChillerDragon> it doesnt arrive on irc :D 
08:53 <+ChillerDragon> webchat just has some cursed interchannel mix
08:53 <+ChillerDragon> i should stop testing my dev progress with nudes
09:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Voxel when do you try to make a ddnet logo. i like the simplism of the current. but if i wouldnt know ddnet. the logo would look too cheap to me.
09:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe u disagree, thats ok. But i'd still like to see a try from you üòâ
09:09 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> most logos from famous 2d games focus on the text mostly apparently

09:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have to say, the rayman logo has charm, gj ubisoft
09:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> all those logos are ugly af and  dealbreaker i would never install such a game
09:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf
09:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ddnet looks like paint against them xD
09:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://ddnet.org/ddnet2.png
09:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
09:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> look at this
09:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> looks very hot
09:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> trollerdragon
09:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im serious
09:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> imo no game can compete with the design and visuals of tw
09:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats one of the reasons why its the best game
09:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ingame has nothing to do with this logo
09:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it does
09:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its sharing a artstyle
09:13 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I thought it was a consequence of the standard tbh
09:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !c this logo looks to me 0% like the visuals ingame or represent them
09:13 < chillerbot1> ChillerDragon
09:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for me it does
09:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think only our flags have these shadows
09:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> of course in cinnematic

09:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cinnematic freedom of a logo
09:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well it comes close. but at least it looks better than ingame üòÇ
09:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1686467728.png
09:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hot af
09:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> totally

09:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok convinced
09:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> new ddnet logo
09:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> perfect
09:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1686467961.png
09:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> update logo pls
09:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thank
09:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> omg so perfect
09:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the choice of color
09:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah btw i find teeworlds logo better

09:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> where did u find that xDDD
09:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tw logo has weird proportions tho
09:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1686468069.png

09:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when put shorts on ddnet.org front page
09:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gotta spice things up go with the time
09:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> make ddnet tiktok for young audience advertisement
09:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> check this :fire: out
09:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/shorts/h9qoyPN-azk
09:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thatll get 2k new tiktokinger ddnet gamers
09:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fossil deen probably still paying for facebook ads to get new ddnet players. Thats why average age these days is 32 on ddnet servers.
09:27 <+bridge> <learath2> Delete this one, it's ableist
09:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> reply moment
09:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont even know what ableist means
09:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato pumping out da daily fancy english vocab
09:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> so ableist of u jop
09:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> ü•∫
09:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> it means discriminatory to disabled people
09:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> as in learath is disabled when it comes to the women
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean to which extend?
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> does rust spec _force_ the compiler to make Box be zero abstraction in all sceneraios where it makes sense? Or is the compiler simply written smart enough...
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the cpp compiler can also optimize away a heap allocation completely if it wants to:
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://godbolt.org/z/qWY11azq1
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say that's literally zero abstraction ^^ (even the heap abstraction is gone)
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> generally with O3 and Ofast lot of stuff gets actually abstracted away or inlined.
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But yes, it often doesn't and it probably depends a lot on where exactly you use these abstractions.
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a member variable unique_ptr might not be optimizable bcs of some weird standard thing
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> GCC says Ofast is not standard compliant. Still (if u dont enable weird stuff like fast math) it will probably generate valid code if u didnt introduce UB.

09:50 <+bridge> <Ewan> twitter term
09:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> had to boot up fakin electron matrix to see ableist was referencing the tw cuddle image
09:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> xd
09:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> u are using element?
09:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> or do u mean discord
09:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which is virus so only way to quit is ``kill $(pgrep -f element)``
09:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> element spyware
09:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> damn
09:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> get a better matrix client
09:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh actually i do have one
09:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> there were good cpp ones last i looked into it
09:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i guess old habbits
09:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> mobile is why i used element

09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it does images in the terminal xd
09:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but its still matrix so everything is slow and buggi

10:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> (or do you talk about zero cost compile time, my answer was about runtime perf)
10:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> cant the bridge just ignore the edit xD
10:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> should i update messages based on levian distance resends?
10:04 < ws-client> <Jupstar> eh wat, yeah just do something
10:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this mf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance
10:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if same author sends two similar messages replace first with second
10:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i see
10:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar> would be cool xd
10:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> might be cursed 
10:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar> totally not overkill
10:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
10:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it took so long to make the fake multiline messages xd
10:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar> üòÇ 
10:09 <+bridge> <learath2> The as-if rule allows everything the compiler can prove. The issue is the halting problem, the compiler can't reduce every piece of code to it's optimal form
10:11 <+bridge> <learath2> But there is no issue with it reducing some constructs to an optimal form, so if you design your language in such a way that it's easily provable to a compiler that it reduces, then you'll have a better time. Because a "sufficiently smart" compiler still can't cover every case
10:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah you are right. I personally would not fight too much about these 2 instructions tho. You go crazy if you do such stuff
10:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> use LTO, O3 and static linking
10:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and the compiler will make good enough good probably^^
10:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sometimes it sounds like all devs are working on super computers where a single instruction actually costs smth
10:12 <+bridge> <learath2> It's been a while since I watched the unique_ptr talk but iirc it was an ABI issue btw
10:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah you are right. I personally would not fight too much about these 2 instructions tho. You go crazy if you do such stuff
10:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> use LTO, O3 and static linking
10:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and the compiler will make good enough binary probably^^
10:12 <+bridge> <learath2> We promise that a unique_ptr will be passed a certain way, that forces us to use a double indirection
10:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah ^^
10:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
10:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but in static linking it should‚Ñ¢Ô∏è not matter, should it?
10:14 <+bridge> <learath2> Static linking + LTO and the compiler is definitely allowed to generate optimal code. Though idk if any do

10:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lerato u got so mani grils in ur class
10:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> go ask one out
10:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨ üò¨ üò¨
10:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> You have exams
10:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> School
10:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> Social outings
10:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
10:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> I have mom and dog and grocery store sometimes
10:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i also have some grocery stores
10:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> they make me good profits
10:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> need to spend more time
10:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> üíµ 
10:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the indont have time is the first excuse u need to get rid of :p
10:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u dont have time
10:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you make time
10:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> True
10:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so leave this chat and do push ups!
10:49 <+bridge> <Ewan> Lol
10:49 <+bridge> <Ewan> Apt complex has one-room gym in the leasing office down the street but it‚Äôs closed after 6:00 and on weekends
10:50 <+bridge> <Ewan> Like
10:50 <+bridge> <Ewan> I can‚Äôt do much with those times
10:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no need to blame gym times when you can do push ups at home
10:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> Home is boring
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u pay for gym to motivate ur self?
10:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> I don‚Äôt pay
10:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> It‚Äôs in leasing office
10:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> Free for tenants
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watever that is
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> o
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> cool
10:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> not guaranteed by any rust standard, but its pretty agressive optimizing enums, with option box u can be sure it will use the null ptr value as a tag for none
10:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> mr fancy pants building
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan leak ur home
10:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep and thats also good like that üòÑ
10:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all in for perf
10:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> Complex is less than 2 yrs old and destroyed by the residents
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> new af
10:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> cpp should go more all in too and break stupid old stuff
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> send images
10:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> It‚Äôs a dump
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont be shy
10:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is private environment
10:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ewan leak whole biography.. dont be shy
10:53 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1117376011575775272/IMG_2612.JPG
10:53 <+bridge> <Ewan> All i got
10:53 <+bridge> <Ewan> No other fotos
10:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> good
10:53 <+bridge> <Ewan> Sry for dm leak broken
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think only like 4-5 people, except companies, i don't know in real life know my real identity. and deen is one of them
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
10:54 <+bridge> <Ewan> Deen could google maps me rn
10:54 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> deen knows everybody :pepechill:
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know someone who knows chillerdragon in realife
10:54 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> even me
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i know someone in real life that knows jupsti
10:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez
10:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
10:54 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> konsti :justatest:
10:54 <+bridge> <Ewan> It was awesome when it was built but nothing is sacred to poor people so we get litter and broken shit
10:55 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I havent met him, but he sent me pictures of himself
10:55 <+bridge> <Ewan> They opened the pool last week and within a day they had an incident with a glass bottle so they had to close it again
10:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > i think only like 4-5 people, except companies, i don't know in real life know my real identity. and deen is one of them
10:55 <+bridge> <Ewan> Fuck section 8
10:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean online?
10:55 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> fun ruined
10:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> imagine doxing ur self to deen
10:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> I got a magnet bro there was no question
10:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !c yeah i mean like ppl i know over the internet
10:56 < chillerbot1> ChillerDragon
10:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like u guys
10:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u know
10:56 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Anything for a sticker
10:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like not actual ppl
10:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u could all be in my head
10:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can confirm i am not actual ppl
10:57 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Ah yes, who would've thought it was AI chillerbot all along
10:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ü§ñ 
10:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> Lol
10:58 <+bridge> <Ewan> This apartment was a blessing though
10:58 <+bridge> <Ewan> First tenants and stuff
10:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as if ryo is not my conscience, reminding me to use Linux and Rust every day
10:58 <+bridge> <Ewan> Lol
11:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cpp cant do this cuz they respect the order of ur fields
11:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and more
11:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:06 <+bridge> <learath2> No I actually don't have the time. With my focus deficiency I barely have enough time to learn everything by exam time. If I fail after getting this close because I was going to the gym I would give up on life
11:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> did u know a null pointer can be valid
11:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if ur not talking about address space 0 that is
11:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> optional pointers. the future
11:07 <+bridge> <learath2> Depends on how you define "valid"
11:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u can deref  it
11:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my bad
11:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just woke up
11:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well im talking about llvm
11:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> int i = *nullptr
11:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> imy world is llvm
11:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> is not right
11:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Address spaces in LLVM are an abstract concept and LLVM attaches no internal meaning to address spaces, apart from: - Location 0 in address space 0 is 'nullptr' and a pointer to this cannot be dereferenced in a well formed program. - pointers in different address spaces cannot alias.
11:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> Cuz rvalue
11:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Robyt3 on which vps does this cause lags, how do u even measure it?
11:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im not talking about cpp
11:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> grag
11:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why u always assumme everything is cpp xd
11:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did you just assume my programming language?!
11:08 <+bridge> <learath2> Even with this definition you can dereference a 0 pointer in an address space othet than address space 0 but not a nullptr, no?
11:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > An address space is an identifier for a target-specific range of address values. An address space is a fundamental part of the type of a pointer value and the type of operations that manipulate memory.
11:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > 
11:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > LLVM affords a default address space (numbered zero) and places a number of assumptions on pointer values within that address space:
11:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > 
11:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> >     The pointer must have a fixed integral value
11:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> >     The null pointer has a bit-value of 0
11:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > 
11:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > These assumptions are not guaranteed to hold in any other address space. In particular, a target may allow pointers in non-default address spaces to have non-integral types.
11:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> I have cpp brain
11:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> learn llvm
11:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u learn so much more
11:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> dont be limited by cpp
11:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> cpp only modern language with common real pointers anyway
11:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> safe assumption when not talking about low level
11:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no?
11:10 <+bridge> <Robyt3> It was on an official server
11:10 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Measured by players saying "lag"
11:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rust has pointers too
11:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> i said real
11:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye
11:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> u use references usually
11:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> they real as can be
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> you have pointers too?
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in cpp u have references too
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> extern crate libc;
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> use std::mem;
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> unsafe {
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     let my_num: *mut i32 = libc::malloc(mem::size_of::<i32>()) as *mut i32;
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     if my_num.is_null() {
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki>         panic!("failed to allocate memory");
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     }
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     libc::free(my_num as *mut libc::c_void);
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> }
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```
11:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we c kek
11:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they say that the whole day
11:12 <+bridge> <Robyt3> mod recorded a demo of it happening
11:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> ye that is real ptr but it‚Äôs in unsafe. which I don‚Äôt know how oftenyou actually use but hopefully rarely
11:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> where is the demo?
11:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but why how often matters here?
11:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it has real pointers
11:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> idk
11:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> was the server up to date?
11:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> u right
11:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk why u make it matter
11:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there are so many questions
11:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> im arguing about nothing
11:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> how late is it in murica
11:12 <+bridge> <Robyt3> The server was at 632b6216be78dd60
11:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> 3 am
11:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :NekoDrink:
11:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> :bluekitty:
11:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we should add perf instrumentation to ddnet
11:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ok idk what that means
11:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ok i do
11:14 <+bridge> <Robyt3> @uwu Do you mind sharing the demo and/or video with @Jupeyy_Keks in DM?
11:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> does it rly lag cuz emotes
11:14 <+bridge> <Robyt3> @uwu Do you mind sharing the demo and/or video showing the emote spam lag with @Jupeyy_Keks in DM?
11:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> learath is writing a bible
11:14 <+bridge> <learath2> I always wanted a profiler builtin, but don't need a profiler to understand that sending 50n packets per second per player spamming is causes lag
11:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol
11:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> network stuff eludes me
11:15 <+bridge> <learath2> s\/is//
11:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> no review on my pr in 24 hours. i smell death
11:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> should have made it smaller
11:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/fn.copy_nonoverlapping.html
11:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think this uses llvm intrinsic memcpy
11:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> üß†
11:17 <+bridge> <Robyt3> You can rebase it on master to fix the Windows build
11:17 <+bridge> <learath2> Or libc memcpy, if they do use libc in rust std
11:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```
11:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:
11:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     src must be valid for reads of count * size_of::<T>() bytes.
11:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     dst must be valid for writes of count * size_of::<T>() bytes.
11:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     Both src and dst must be properly aligned.
11:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
11:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     The region of memory beginning at src with a size of count * size_of::<T>() bytes must not overlap with the region of memory beginning at dst with the same size.
11:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```
11:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i like how rust cares about UB and they list it clearly on the method
11:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> okay, i took a look and it was complaining about std function which I‚Äôm using. if it said the source file of origin I didn‚Äôt see, i assumed it was my thing and I can‚Äôt fix rn cuz I can‚Äôt get vs rn
11:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> if rebase fixes tho sweet
11:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> it probably doesn‚Äôt like my type alias ufh
11:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1117382714857885826/IMG_3129.png
11:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> stupid
11:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> and the mac fail seems like some crap i forgot i changed
11:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> I‚Äôll deal with it tomorrow but it should build on gcc of all flavors if that‚Äôs your concern
11:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://youtube.com/shorts/CRzA9R2LLUA?feature=share
11:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> Important
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao
11:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> I love joeyy
11:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1117386827964362762/IMG_3124.jpg
11:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> Inspiring
11:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is our packet header 42 bytes long?
11:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !c u work on this the whole day
11:53 < chillerbot1> ChillerDragon
11:53 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ur time to shine
11:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
11:54 <+bridge> <Ewan> enlighten me on the netcode
11:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/06/packet_layout.html
11:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1117391380868775936/image.png
11:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> where does this 42 come from then?
11:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dont we send in udp
11:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whcih code is that
11:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems like the answer to everything
11:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> CClient::DebugRender
11:55 <+bridge> <Ewan> Lol
11:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 42 / 8 = 5
11:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which is closer to the packet header size xd
11:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe some drunk thought its bits?
11:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems random to me
11:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
11:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i cant trust these values
11:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no
11:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what you want to know?
11:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> an estimate overhead of emoticons
11:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
11:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> still?
11:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isnt it fast again?
11:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it was way too much, but it sends many packets
11:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bro i doubt Ger servers cant handle
11:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just open wireshark
11:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but deen and robster want to destroy my beloved game
11:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ;~;
11:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> !c when i have filter active, is it also active in the IO graph?
11:59 < chillerbot1> ChillerDragon
11:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont use wireshark so often
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whats IO graph
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
11:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the stats tool
11:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> inside wireshark
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> never used it
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i would look at the timestamps xd
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but graph sounds good
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but dont rec with wireshark
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``tcpdump -i lo -w emotes.pcap "port 8303"`` then spam emotes on local server and then analyse the pcap file w wireshark
12:00 <+bridge> <Robyt3> @Jupeyy_Keks Have you tried your normal emote spam with the new delay? Even if I use a bind for one emote I never hit the delay. Only if I use one bind that sends multiple emotes does it hit the delay.
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye wat robi said
12:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> emote fin eon ddnet rn no?
12:00 <+bridge> <Robyt3> no, currently it's too fast so it causes lags
12:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i tested the 4 tick delay your change would introduce and its defs noticable with that
12:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh
12:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's so fast that it causes lags on some russian server
12:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no proof no happen
12:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> robi leak tcpdump of lags
12:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as if i have to endure pain bcs russia lives in 1980
12:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or didnt happen
12:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòÇ
12:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the client also shows it in kilobits
12:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> such a troll
12:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> stats always rigged
12:09 <+bridge> <Anime.pdf> Sure, im not near pc rn, if you need demo as well, tell me, so i will try to send it as soon as possible
12:10 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Okay, thanks, please DM the .demo to me or @Jupeyy_Keks later when you have time
12:10 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> we can edit whatsapp messages now
12:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u still use this bloat
12:11 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yup
12:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wat u usin jupsti
12:11 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> SiGnAL
12:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> signal more spyware than discord
12:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it straight up forces you to connect a phone
12:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> might as well use tiktok messenger
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also is whatsapp even bloat?
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> def slimmer than discord
12:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have to use telegram for friends
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> telegram is super shady imo
12:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else matrix only actually.. ok matrix big bloat too
12:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not gonna deny xd
12:13 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also doubt telegram is less bloat than whatsapp
12:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my brother just forced my whole family to use matrix üòÇ
12:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pog
12:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but element no multi user
12:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so u text ur parents under the name jupsti?
12:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> element sucks so hard you can not sep identities
12:15 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> better than wire
12:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> element no?
12:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wire supports multi acc
12:16 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> and yet it sux
12:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> is faster and less buggy
12:16 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> full buggy
12:16 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> most buggy messenger ive seen in a while
12:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe on android
12:16 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> also windows
12:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> garbage oses
12:16 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> runs smooth as botter on iOS and linux
12:17 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ur botter
12:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ü§ñ 
12:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no proof
12:17 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> :BOT:

13:31 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> its obvious
13:31 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> @keb
14:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i vote for breaking back compat
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks ddnet 2 will start thanks to emotes
15:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> better than having no emotes üòÇ
15:09 <+bridge> <Pipou> Do we really still care about Teeworlds ? :justatest:
15:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Pipou its also backcompat with ddnet iself
15:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 16.8 vs 16.9
15:09 <+bridge> <Pipou> Ah
15:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> loooots
15:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> of hacks
15:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> to keep backcompat
15:10 <+bridge> <Pipou> Force everyone to update :gigachad:
15:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i am pro that
15:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but rage will ensure
15:10 <+bridge> <Voxel> god i wanna help with ddnet 2 so badly
15:10 <+bridge> <Voxel> i can give out so many ideas
15:11 <+bridge> <Voxel> for example: complete emotes rehaul
15:11 <+bridge> <Voxel> we dont need 3 angry emotes
15:12 <+bridge> <Pipou> Agreed
15:12 <+bridge> <Pipou> I don't even understand the point of having an outdated client
15:13 <+bridge> <Pipou> There will always be happy and angry people no matter what happens
15:13 <+bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/958476112550305912/1046910627865698324/image.png
15:14 <+bridge> <Pipou> Looks nice
15:15 <+bridge> <Pipou> Is that a sprite ?
15:15 <+bridge> <Voxel> yeah but its now from a defunct pr
15:16 <+bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/958476112550305912/1046931008873840660/image.png
15:16 <+bridge> <nostr0> Is there a place where I can put feature requests for the DDNet client??
15:16 <+bridge> <jao187> whats a tornado supposed to mean
15:16 <+bridge> <Voxel> dizzy
15:17 <+bridge> <Voxel> or mildly annoyed
15:17 <+bridge> <Voxel> up to interpretatiob
15:17 <+bridge> <Voxel> or mildly annoyed

15:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @nostr0 yes here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/
15:19 <+bridge> <Pipou> Animated emoticons would be fun
15:19 <+bridge> <murpi> and then super reactions
15:19 <+bridge> <Pipou> üòÇ
15:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also i want fortnite dances for ma tee
15:20 <+bridge> <Voxel> so a tile of pngs?
15:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gif
15:20 <+bridge> <Voxel> dont gifs like
15:20 <+bridge> <Voxel> not work in games
15:20 <+bridge> <murpi> sprays??????
15:21 <+bridge> <Pipou> I have no idea, would be good if it could play sprites directly
15:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes sprays! xd
15:23 <+bridge> <Voxel> ANIMATED WEAPONS TOO???
15:23 <+bridge> <murpi> HELL YES DOOD
15:23 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> raytraced ;)
15:24 <+bridge> <Pipou> Weapons game skins working like tee skins
15:24 <+bridge> <Voxel> like when we inevitably split apart the game sprites, the weapons could be their own pngs
15:24 <+bridge> <Voxel> and if you wanted them to be animated you could attach a python script that specifies all the coords and timing and states
15:24 <+bridge> <Voxel> map shaders
15:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i want rtx rifle with bouncing lights from the shot
15:25 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> different game.png so others can see yours
15:25 <+bridge> <Voxel> @RonIn ‚òØ
15:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i saw his vid

15:26 <+bridge> <murpi> don't be unrealistic

15:28 <+bridge> <murpi> wait what does interactive smoke physics mean :thonk:
15:28 <+bridge> <Robyt3> doesn't require breaking backwards compatibility, old clients would simply not use any smoke emitters
15:28 <+bridge> <Robyt3> we already have interactive smoke physics
15:28 <+bridge> <Robyt3> but they are hardly noticable because smoke last for less than half a second
15:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> god tauri required me to add a gtk webkit dep
15:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo time

15:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> i remember seeing an old video about there being a fire and theres smoke
15:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> and the tee jumping through it
15:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> i want that back
15:29 <+bridge> <Robyt3> it's all still there
15:29 <+bridge> <Robyt3> just add smoke
15:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> ü§î
15:29 <+bridge> <Voxel> will try to integrate into maps soon
15:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> volumetric smoke = 10 fps
15:30 <+bridge> <Robyt3> it's not very advanced but it works well enough considering there isn't much smoke
15:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> we also need flashbangs
15:30 <+bridge> <Voxel> lets add map bosses!!!!!
15:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we need to drop windows support too
15:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and quicksand
15:31 <+bridge> <Voxel> no
15:31 <+bridge> <murpi> Don't need a lot of fps if you can't see anything anyway
15:31 <+bridge> <Voxel> too far
15:31 <+bridge> <Voxel> shoo penquin shoo
15:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes new ddnet 2 please appstore only
15:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> metal and apple first
15:31 <+bridge> <Voxel> half your playerbase will die :troll:
15:31 <+bridge> <Pipou> Switch support
15:34 <+bridge> <Voxel> damn thia topic died fast
15:34 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> xpanic
15:34 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> diep.io
15:34 <+bridge> <Voxel> damn this topic died fast
15:34 <+bridge> <Voxel> true
15:34 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> sprite sheet would be weird
15:35 <+bridge> <Voxel> but dont game engines hate gifs
15:35 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> nvm its like
15:35 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> the only solution
15:35 <+bridge> <Voxel> yea
15:35 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> either that or png for each frame
15:35 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> gifs just suck
15:35 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> tbh

15:58 <+bridge> <bencie> ooo thats really cool
15:58 <+bridge> <Bomf> do this when
16:25 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> :justatest: we would need to separate parts of the weapon
16:26 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> in 0.7 this would be ez af for you
16:26 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> When 0.7 Asset support, so it's possible? :greenthing:
17:17 <+bridge> <louis> u press 6 to take out a bong and then mouse 1 to rip it
17:32 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> ~~louis is too young to know this much about a bong~~
17:48 <+bridge> <Voxel> :troll:
17:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3> @Voxel I was wrong, the flow component is currently disabled, but it doesn't take much code to enable again: https://github.com/Robyt3/ddnet/tree/Client-Flow-Activate (for testing I increased the smoke lifespan from 0.5-0.9 seconds to 50-90 seconds)
17:58 <+bridge> <Robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1117482944903250011/Base_Profile_2023.06.11_-_17.52.12.02-1.mp4
17:58 <+bridge> <Voxel> yeah i thought so
17:58 <+bridge> <Voxel> i hope i can make this work without a thousand errors
17:59 <+bridge> <Robyt3> you mean smoke source tiles?
17:59 <+bridge> <Voxel> yeah
18:00 <+bridge> <Voxel> tiles you can place in maps that make their own smoke
18:00 <+bridge> <Voxel> or something like that
18:00 <+bridge> <Voxel> id see if mappers would want this tho
18:00 <+bridge> <Robyt3> we should probably add a completely new "Effects" layers for this
18:01 <+bridge> <Robyt3> but for your prototype to see how it looks in maps it's not necessary
18:02 <+bridge> <Voxel> thats reasonable
18:02 <+bridge> <Voxel> theres a lot i want to do to make maps more immersive but i doubt any will see the light of day
18:28 <+bridge> <gerdoe> @learath2 thankies!!!
18:35 <+bridge> <gerdoe> yeah! there was a video where matricks showed flow feature out
18:54 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> cool
18:55 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> why specifically smoke
18:55 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> just particles or something
18:55 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> and use the smoke image
18:55 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> :troll:
19:06 <+bridge> <Voxel> maybe
19:06 <+bridge> <Voxel> yoo what if we could have rain type particles
19:18 <+bridge> <louis> a nice addition for visuals would actually be custom lasers
19:18 <+bridge> <louis> laser/sg shots
20:26 <+bridge> <Voxel> you mean like the actual laser?
20:27 <+bridge> <Voxel> maybe but idk how itd work
20:40 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> the thing we clearly need for ddnet 2 are curved lasers
20:42 <+bridge> <Teero> ye and curved hooks too :feelsamazingman:
20:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> light sabers
20:43 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> @fokkonaut
20:49 <+bridge> <louis> add smoke grenades
20:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> flashbang
20:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> add smoke grenades, all possible weapons, go 3d, 5 players per team, bombs, cts and ts
20:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rename game
21:02 <+bridge> <learath2> When will we have hooks that bend around terrain?
21:04 <+bridge> <louis> harpoon
21:04 <+bridge> <Bomf> Would it be possible to have your custom laser/sg colours visible to other players?
21:04 <+bridge> <Â∞èÈπø‰∫ÇÊíû> Hi
21:05 <+bridge> <learath2> It would be a mess, so no, but if you forked ddnet it would be indeed possible to implement
21:05 <+bridge> <Voxel> https://nohello.net/en/
21:05 <+bridge> <Voxel> :troll:
21:06 <+bridge> <Bomf> I think it may be interesting for customisation aspect colour coordinate stuff etc
21:06 <+bridge> <Bomf> ++ able to see who is shooting which laser clearer ig
21:07 <+bridge> <Voxel> when send literally everything through the server? gameskin, particles, laser colors
21:07 <+bridge> <Bomf> Ezez
21:07 <+bridge> <Bomf> Make total user customisation
21:08 <+bridge> <Voxel> maybe even custom sounds too
21:13 <+bridge> <Â∞èÈπø‰∫ÇÊíû> guys i need dd code
21:14 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet ?
21:18 <+bridge> <louis> i say ddnet should break backwards compatibility
21:24 <+bridge> <learath2> If there is a good enough reason for it we could but I doubt such a reason exists
21:26 <+bridge> <louis> better new features
21:27 <+bridge> <louis> and also less barrier for new devs/prs
21:27 <+bridge> <louis> i mainly mean compatibility with vanilla
21:27 <+bridge> <learath2> yeah vanilla compat is worth dropping probably
21:28 <+bridge> <Voxel> id be up for it, ddnet needs a rework anyways
21:33 <+bridge> <louis> im not sure if anyone else could agree but i feel like ddnet has had a content drought for a while
21:33 <+bridge> <louis> the only new content is really maps
21:34 <+bridge> <louis> the super high skill ceiling helps too
21:39 <+bridge> <Bomf> I think new customisation options would be great for the game ^^ if we are able to make it so tees can be seen by all then why not game skins etc
21:39 <+bridge> <Voxel> i mean i guess the graphical changes also count as content but idk
21:40 <+bridge> <Voxel> @cyberfighter hows the progress on that gamemode
21:40 <+bridge> <louis> i meant gameplay content
21:40 <+bridge> <Voxel> if u know
21:40 <+bridge> <Bomf> Ah gameplay content
21:40 <+bridge> <Bomf> New gun when
21:41 <+bridge> <Voxel> harpoon
21:41 <+bridge> <Bomf> I see
21:41 <+bridge> <Bomf> How will@I work
21:41 <+bridge> <Bomf> How will itwork
21:42 <+bridge> <Voxel> i forgot what harpoon does
21:42 <+bridge> <Bomf> It is for killing fish I thought
21:42 <+bridge> <Bomf> Manual gravity inverter could be cool
21:43 <+bridge> <louis> its just like a longer hook i tgink
21:43 <+bridge> <louis> i dont rly tnjnk it has tooo much application in ddnet
21:43 <+bridge> <Voxel> OH SHIT I REMEMBER YOYO
21:44 <+bridge> <Voxel> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/342454474117218334/1010788357346955318

21:44 <+bridge> <Bomf> Interesting idea also
21:46 <+bridge> <louis> i was thinking diff blocks as content
21:47 <+bridge> <louis> there was a wip for ice, slime, some others
21:47 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> what gamemode
21:47 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> which
21:47 <+bridge> <louis> and interact-able objects
21:47 <+bridge> <louis> would be huge
21:47 <+bridge> <Voxel> the uhhhh
21:47 <+bridge> <Voxel> clan fight
21:47 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> clanwar is pretty much done i think
21:47 <+bridge> <Voxel> oh yea TRUE
21:47 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> many lands
21:48 <+bridge> <Voxel> you know what would be AWESOME? tunes that trigger envelopes
21:48 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> switches
21:48 <+bridge> <Voxel> yes
21:48 <+bridge> <Voxel> thats what i mean
21:48 <+bridge> <Voxel> like envelopes can be stopped, started, played from beginning and stuff
21:48 <+bridge> <Voxel> itd only be client sided
21:52 <+bridge> <Voxel> shit you know what would also be cool? logic blocks
21:52 <+bridge> <Voxel> like if switch 1 is on go to TO3 else TO5
21:52 <+bridge> <Voxel> itd make games like volleyball much more compact
23:22 <+bridge> <kitsche> yooo hello!
