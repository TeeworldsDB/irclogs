07:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: I almost finished my kernel module, it can detect input packets, but it crashes the kernel when it tries to encode a packet xd
08:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yikes
08:24 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I don't even know how to debug it xd
08:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Same code doesn‚Äôt crash outside of the kernel?
08:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yup
08:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Annoying
08:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I took a random packet from wireshark and it works fine
08:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Write angry email to Linus saying his kernel is trash and has crashbugs
08:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> It's time to use forbidden jutsu called "comment line by line to see where it stops crashing"
08:30 < bridge> <pioooooo> Bisect instead
08:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> hello
08:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> today is the day i started using fish
08:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> because there's rust port?
08:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
08:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> and cuz yes xd
08:35 < bridge> <milkeeycat> has anyone tried ghostty?
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> overhyped terminal
08:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna try this shell someday https://www.nushell.sh/
08:39 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> seems fitting xD
08:42 < bridge> <Ewan> awesome
08:43 < bridge> <Ewan> u should get the async prompt and delimeter matching plugins
08:43 < bridge> <Ewan> very ergonomic
08:43 < bridge> <Ewan> fzf integration
08:43 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I tried using it but it broke all my conf/scripts so I switched back until I have time to switch properly
08:43 < bridge> <Ewan> #!/usr/bin/env bash
08:44 < bridge> <Ewan> the shebang tells the shell what program to use
08:44 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah that's a good idea
08:44 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> although I also meant the .profile conf (for the shell)
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> fish doesn‚Äôt touch your profile
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> you can‚Äôt source it directly without bass, a transpiling plugin
08:45 < bridge> <Ewan> fish configs go in ~/.config/fish/conf.d or config.fish of whatever
08:46 < bridge> <Ewan> fish configs go in ~/.config/fish/conf.d or config.fish or whatever
08:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O
08:46 < bridge> <Ewan> this looks interesting
08:47 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah I didn't research about it that much tbh üòÖ and I didn't have the energy to rice the terminal (still haven't found the time)
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i never really riced
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> i only added a right side prompt to show the direnv dir name
08:47 < bridge> <Ewan> in gray text
08:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> oh I am prob using wrong term
08:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ricing in my head is changing plus dotfiles
08:48 < bridge> <Ewan> lol fair
08:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> so I intend to use tmux/change lf(terminal file manager/terminal editor(try out kakoune or smt) and make shortcuts and scripts for everything
08:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw do you have a good source/example of dotfiles for fish or in general to share?
08:53 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs more about seeking out features you want and then just pasting them in piecemeal
08:53 < bridge> <Ewan> mine is basically nothing but aliases
08:53 < bridge> <Ewan> and that
08:53 < bridge> <Ewan> fzf and direnv hooks
08:54 < bridge> <Ewan> my plugin stuff is handled automatically by nix but you‚Äôd load them from there typically (i assume fisher just appends to the generated config file)
08:55 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> oh you use nixos?
08:55 < bridge> <Ewan> ye
08:55 < bridge> <Ewan> well
08:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> i just run fish at end of bashrc
08:55 < bridge> <Ewan> and mac
08:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo wiki
08:55 < bridge> <Ewan> makes sense
08:55 < bridge> <Ewan> do u exec
08:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> it also said bass as option
08:56 < bridge> <Ewan> what you‚Äôre doing is probably better
08:56 < bridge> <Ewan> though envvars in fish work fairly differently
08:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
08:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> # keep this line at the bottom of ~/.bashrc
08:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> [ -x /bin/fish ] && SHELL=/bin/fish exec fish
08:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> ```
08:56 < bridge> <Ewan> you should read abt exported vs global vars
08:56 < bridge> <Ewan> they slightly confusing compared to bash
08:58 < bridge> <Ewan> and universal and local
08:59 < bridge> <Ewan> more like (local|global|universal) (export)
09:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> wat thisndo
09:00 < bridge> <Ewan> universal variables are really nice
09:00 < bridge> <Ewan> async prompt lets you type in while the command is terminating ig
09:00 < bridge> <Ewan> idk exactly how it works but it‚Äôs free time savings basically because if you need it then you‚Äôre always gonna be spending that typing anyway
09:01 < bridge> <Ewan> makes it snappier
09:01 < bridge> <Ewan> and then the other one just matches quotes and parens and stuff
09:01 < bridge> <Ewan> idk exactly how it works but it‚Äôs free time savings basically because if you need it then you‚Äôre always gonna be spending that time typing anyway
09:04 < bridge> <Ewan> and then the other one just adds closing quotes and parens and stuff
09:05 < bridge> <Ewan> i sleep now. good luck in your fish journey

11:26 < bridge> <totar> there is still RUS2-6 listed

11:27 < bridge> <totar> idk
11:27 < bridge> <‚ôÇS1mple‚ôÇ> Aren't rus4 and 6 block ones

12:10 < bridge> <0xdeen> They didn't kick us out, but whenever there is a DoS attack the server becomes unreachable for new players
12:10 < bridge> <0xdeen> so I didn't prolong the server
12:11 < bridge> <0xdeen> There is still RUS2/3/5 and player numbers haven't increased recently anyway

15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah
15:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> only when merged
15:29 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah i see
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lol my github design suddenly changed
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they added so much space to everything üòÆ
15:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe bit too  much tbh xD

15:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> rustfmt should run on save :o - isnt it formatted? :kek:
15:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> let me format and fix the conflict myself then
15:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> alright
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can you also fix your clippy warning then xd
16:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> :justatest:
16:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> my workspace isnt setup correctly - got it! :kekw:
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you could have used the workspace in misc üòâ
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> actually seems like clippy is missing in the workspace, seems like i changed that globally
16:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> @jupeyy_keks i swear to god i just made 3 git mistakes in a row - can you quickly resolve my stuff? :kekw:
16:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> looks correct to me or not?
16:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> i fucked up a merge, then i fucked up a rebase, then i force pushed the WRONG rebase, and now i reverted everything back
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wait for the ci pr and then i rebase it üòÑ

16:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no idea why, but it just reset the author to me lol
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @blaiszephyr can u please `git fetch --all`, `git reset --hard origin/checker-tile-selector` and then `git commit --amend --reset-author`
16:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> lol sure
16:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> watdahell
16:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thanks, i hope u didn't change any code afterwards that i removed now
16:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> i didnt modify it further - i think
16:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> your force pushes showed u once fixed the .clone but then added it again
16:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lol
16:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> ¬∞-¬∞
16:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> HuH
16:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> man just cherry pick my changes and PR it yourself - wtf :kek:
16:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> git hard
16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i swear it almost looks like a git bug
16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. u reverted a commit from me, but the code editor showed it's all fine
16:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329479208061239428/image.png?ex=678a7d7f&is=67892bff&hm=121815d84784863296ac9c0ded351c954b2e5490103f2ac451c55a9c566d07aa&
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i kinda have the feeling github swapped the commits here
16:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> i am utter confusion
16:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tja, weird af
16:58 < bridge> <woidless> @blaiszephyr Can you please remind me which file contains the GAMETYPENAME of the Server, that is, DDRace , and TestDDR?
16:58 < bridge> <woidless> 1 coder and I are preparing an interesting project.
17:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> This picture is where I would say that the spacing is a tiny bit larger
17:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> IIRC it's a variable you set
17:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
17:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> look for `SvGametype`
17:03 < bridge> <woidless> Thx
17:12 < bridge> <ferkoo.> @leoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
17:19 < bridge> <soulyvevo> this part is a scam how do i even do this
17:19 < bridge> <soulyvevo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329485128761872424/image.png?ex=678a8303&is=67893183&hm=0eca26e784b381489d32dbf8b11acc3d377c3788c3c44c8e287eee2e7c9ab039&
17:19 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @jupeyy_keks why does my fps drop so hard when i open scoreboard or console
17:19 < bridge> <soulyvevo> is it because of the whole blur effect?
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how hard is hard?
17:20 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i get 300 fps when having scoreboard or console opened
17:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes the blur effect isn't really the cheapest, dunno if it can be achieved with less rendering xd
17:20 < bridge> <soulyvevo> and 200 fps when both opened at once lmao
17:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that a solo map? xd
17:22 < bridge> <soulyvevo> its 1of4 from rust ddrace lmao
17:22 < bridge> <soulyvevo> looks like laser is missing on the left
17:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh interesting
17:23 < bridge> <soulyvevo> oh and
17:24 < bridge> <soulyvevo> @jupeyy_keks how do i bind anything lmao
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> front layer i see
17:24 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i remember struggling with that
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what's the problem
17:24 < bridge> <soulyvevo> for example how do i bind dummy toggle to a key
17:25 < bridge> <soulyvevo> or how do i change my mouse distance from console
17:25 < bridge> <soulyvevo> oh wait mouse distance was easy nvm
17:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bind f toggle_dummy
17:26 < bridge> <soulyvevo> bruh last time i was searching for it real hard
17:27 < bridge> <soulyvevo> and got confused because cl_dummy just showed that list of all dummy settings
17:27 < bridge> <soulyvevo> grouping settings together is kinda cool tho ngl
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you mean this?
17:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329487312668721283/image.png?ex=678a850c&is=6789338c&hm=bfc80a65f9df3504d254c76e30a424c3bee3e3abee45d46caa35707e05bcaddd&
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah toggle_dummy is not a conf var anymore
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's a proper command
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs there is also change_dummy if u want more than 1 dummy
17:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but currently adding more dummies is hidden under `dbg.app true` üòõ
17:50 < bridge> <soulyvevo> what do yall even know about ddracing
17:50 < bridge> <soulyvevo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329493087113842824/image.png?ex=678a8a6c&is=678938ec&hm=b7f7dd583b0514092f9e3aa4eed107a5cc436bcc477815067abaf937547cea82&
17:51 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i didnt know how to get dummy hammerfly to work so i just used `+dummy.fire` on the entire thing
17:51 < bridge> <soulyvevo> had to do some quick switches and spins in midair
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is also +dummy.aim_on_char
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or similar
17:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then u have basically deepfly
17:53 < bridge> <soulyvevo> it just looks my way
17:54 < bridge> <soulyvevo> but doesnt hammer
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well combined with dummy.+fire
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> +dummy.fire
17:54 < bridge> <soulyvevo> how do i even combine binds
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> simply add a semicolon
17:54 < bridge> <soulyvevo> oh and how do those rgb settings work
17:54 < bridge> <soulyvevo> like anything color related
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bind mouse_left +fire;+dummy.fire;+dummy.aim_character
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> html or css tags
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so #fffff
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or rgb(20,20,20)
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so #ffffff
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or rgb(20,20,20)
17:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> @jupeyy_keks to upload skins, you gotta go to the teedata discord?
17:57 < bridge> <hectavoxel> for ddnet-rs specifically?
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you gotta send them to me xd
17:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i think i already did send them to you
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah your robot?
17:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> yea
17:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> robot + weapons, anything else?
17:59 < bridge> <hectavoxel> thats it for now
17:59 < bridge> <pioooooo> Is it already playable now?
17:59 < bridge> <pioooooo> Connect to existing DDNet servers?
17:59 < bridge> <soulyvevo> thx
17:59 < bridge> <soulyvevo> theres only one test ddrace server
18:00 < bridge> <pioooooo> Oh then I guess it won't be located in China
18:04 < bridge> <soulyvevo> watching people from far away with dummy preview feels like some five night at freddies thing

18:29 < bridge> <hectavoxel> finally caught the crash log üî•
18:30 < bridge> <kollpotato> panic is the worst rust feature xD
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what else should it do?
18:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh, did you join any team?
18:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> just return result
18:33 < bridge> <kollpotato> and handle it without uwnraps
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i added them, but sadly needs a fix in code too:
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-rs/pull/72
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh can't agree tbh.
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Sometimes handling the result is worse
18:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i think i made my own and then asked someone else to join it
18:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> and then it randomly crashed LOL
18:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs u create weird incsonsitent states
18:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> oh no the rust guru is typing
18:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> @mpft apparently if i set `[ -x /bin/fish ] && SHELL=/bin/fish exec fish` at end of bashrc, when i login it doesnt run startx xinit stuff
18:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> my login is bare, no gui
18:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> what about validating the state?
18:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> but yeah i get you i think
18:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> sometimes u want the app to crash
18:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> if u have done something silly
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think a good rule of thumb is.
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if somewhere in your function you set someting to a mutable variable. then you should better crash
18:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you rely on RAII you can return as long u never assign anything to a mutable state

18:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> HAHAHA
18:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh yeah this is defs a problem, but i think i found the issue while joining
19:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> fixed it, but i saw u could already join ^^
19:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> @jupeyy_keks i forgor how to fix that wayland bug
19:12 < bridge> <kollpotato> can u explain it again
19:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=`
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but do you even still have it?
19:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea i do
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since i reworked the cursor lock i dont have it anymore lol
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i also updated kde
19:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe they fixed it lol
19:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> idk maybe i didnt update the cloned repo
19:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> i did git pull
19:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> i think it is enough
19:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> now i must join the collaborative map editor
19:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> and troll a bit

19:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> @jupeyy_keks you are crazy :justatest:

19:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> all that work in solo
19:49 < bridge> <chairn> don't look at the `backend_vulkan.cpp` file then üòÑ
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah it's a lot already, but also took me over 2 years so
19:53 < bridge> <kollpotato> it was worth it right
19:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> jupstar is a RiiR white knight
19:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> but chad cuz he did it
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i had fun, so yeah. but sometimes i also felt like it was a waste of time xd
19:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah i also think about that with the teeworlds server i code in rust
19:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> but i still continue
19:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> then i give up
19:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> and the cycle repeats
19:59 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i think it was definitely worth it
20:22 < bridge> <chairn> RiiR ?
20:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> rewrite it in rust
20:23 < bridge> <hectavoxel> RiiTNAPL

21:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no that commend seems out of place xD
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> move it one layer up
21:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> how shall you blame the rust genius
21:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> say CRITICAL BUG FIX
21:10 < bridge> <kollpotato> comment contributor
21:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> ey i contributed code!
21:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> i can refactor one constant in the ddnet source
21:13 < bridge> <kollpotato> should i make a pr for that
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i takeeverything
21:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> i mean ddnet
21:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> not ddnet-rs
21:14 < bridge> <kollpotato> sorry
21:15 < bridge> <kollpotato> :cammo:
21:15 < bridge> <robyt3> Replace every 32 with `CCollision::BLOCK_SIZE` :justatest:
21:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> why not xD
21:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> @jupeyy_keks my brain is hurting from this
21:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329544877809074186/image.png?ex=678abaa8&is=67896928&hm=d069dfdc180462b976761ddbaa13ed7579561521cdd547b4a29ad4278620bc35&
21:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> i dont understand shit
21:16 < bridge> <kollpotato> even more string types
21:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> you're looking at the worst code of ddnet-rs man :kek:
21:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> i mean if he can explain why its necessary then its not bad
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> its easier if you know what you want to know - just reading it like that will make your brain go boom

21:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> xD
21:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the network strings are basically just strings with char limit
21:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that logic will be even worse in future
21:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> have you thought about using stack strings?
21:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> like arraystring
21:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> stack is faster
21:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> probably
21:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thought yes, but i use pool mostly
21:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> pool is as fast as stack
21:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> does pool mean strings will be reused?
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well most of the time xd
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
21:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> omg
21:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> im smart
21:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> wtfff
21:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> insane
21:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea
21:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> i dont know how they are reused though
21:19 < bridge> <kollpotato> but who cares right
21:19 < bridge> <oxyzo.> congrats! you now have ownership of ddnet
21:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> gonna ban the people who blocked me 6 months ago
21:20 < bridge> <kollpotato> revenge is real
21:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> @robyt3 could you send the server ip you were testing on?
21:28 < bridge> <robyt3> tw-0.7+udp://45.142.178.158:8704
21:28 < bridge> <DDNet> 45.142.178.158:8704 is not a DDraceNetwork or Community server.
21:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> soooo should i do it or not
21:34 < bridge> <kollpotato> where do i put the constant
21:36 < bridge> <robyt3> I wouldn't, you'd have to go through almost every file and it would cause a lot of conflicts
21:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah i thought about conflicts too
21:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> roby thinking if they should really give Koll this task - scared it will break them mentally and physically
21:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> :cammo:
21:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeah
21:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> i will break ddnet
21:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> accidentally
21:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> been there, done that
21:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> really?
21:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> i managed to break CI - confusing me and 3 other people! :kek:
21:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> then i can make one pr with this change
21:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329550398142550047/image.png?ex=678abfcc&is=67896e4c&hm=c0ecbf756225b8eb32fbc1582ed20de88647ba2de9efe57a2410e7e556b4cabf&

21:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> and break the whole protocol
21:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> yippe
21:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> well it aint that scary
21:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> servers still worked right
21:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> i dont really PR changes that are able to break anything in ddnet, most of my PR's are typos and refactors
21:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> afair every feature i tried PR'ing was closed :Sadge:
21:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> well refactoring can break stuff
21:40 < bridge> <kollpotato> damn
21:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> my condolences
21:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329551030102261782/image.png?ex=678ac063&is=67896ee3&hm=a2f452b1fe56925d08f4691e860c4611103a197e261e129ccc0749b90cdb44ef&
21:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not sure what‚Äôs happening
21:41 < bridge> <kollpotato> i still remember that time when u suggested me implementing a better config parser
21:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> the dummy's movement inversed
21:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> the string parser
21:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> a is d, d is a
21:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> i could not do it though
21:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> might try again
21:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: you can always test it on your machine :santatrollet:
21:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs used in ddrace.cpp not sure if it is still defined there
21:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How is one supposed to see that in the video lol
21:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am pro dummies lol
21:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But cool stuff!
21:45 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Is the lib already that useful? I thought too much is missing still
21:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> arrow above the tee points to the opposite direction to dummy's movement :p
21:46 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i added one more "message" which is used for messages which are not handled yet, it saves raw bytes
21:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and I added input message
21:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it's on `hack` branch in the lib repo
21:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> sus
21:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> hack is like hacky solution
21:48 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ye I get it
21:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> :pepeH:
21:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I've spent so much time trying to debug why a tee simply couldn't move, in the end I realized I was overwriting ethernet frame bytes :pepeW:
21:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Kernel moment
21:50 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i changed the offset 10 times until it worked xd
21:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So you are done?
21:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ye
21:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I'll test it on my machine, to see if it's not too laggy
21:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Next project is to use ddnet\_protocol for ddnet-rs bridge! Thanks.
21:52 < bridge> <zhn> :justatest:
21:52 < bridge> <zhn> there's no reason to do it actually
21:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> writing without lsp was so weird
21:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> i'm fine with a way for ddnet-rs to connect to ddnet
21:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> when it doesnt require a single codechange on ddnet-rs :kekw:
21:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> dont want a new project to need a full compatibility layer a month after it's launch
21:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> i'm enjoying the encapsulation rn :kek:
21:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> i'm fine with a way for ddnet-rs to connect to ddnet
21:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> when it doesnt require a single codechange on ddnet-rs :kekw:
21:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> dont want a new project to need a full compatibility layer a month after it's launch
21:54 < bridge> <kollpotato> wait so ddnet-rs can connect to ddnet servers or not
21:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> no
21:54 < bridge> <zhn> no
21:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You are hooked! Time to switch back to nano
21:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> me ü§ù  zhn
21:55 < bridge> <zhn> i mean i can understand adding ddnet rs support to current ddnet but no vice versa
21:55 < bridge> <zhn> theoretically ddnet rs offers more
21:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> ddnet-nerdy-ass-programming-language
21:55 < bridge> <milkeeycat> my next project will be written in ed
21:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> hecta just had an orgasm hearing you say that
21:55 < bridge> <zhn> did you finish your protocol thingie?
21:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> rewriting it from scratch for the 3rd or 4th already
21:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> üëç
21:56 < bridge> <zhn> nice, did the same xd
21:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> i like reinventing the wheel
21:56 < bridge> <zhn> i did the same*
21:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> i considered writing my own stack string
21:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> but ig thats too much
21:56 < bridge> <zhn> no its not
21:56 < bridge> <zhn> but its implemented already
21:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea
21:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> why is string length always 32 bits
21:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> why not make ShortArrayString
21:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> gerdoe since i'm busy helping jupsti create the best mapping tool anyone has ever seen, how about you start actually creating a proper community on ddnet-rs to game on??????
21:57 < bridge> <kollpotato> with 8 bits for length
21:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> we need battlefield, zombies, alivefng, zcatch, ddrace, kog, city, ...
21:58 < bridge> <zhn> vanilla old farts barely move from 0.7 to ddnet, i got no chance to actually move it xd
21:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> üò≠
21:58 < bridge> <zhn> also since speedtime makes his own ranking system based on 0.6 theres less chances
21:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> @gerdoe when will 0.8 come out
21:59 < bridge> <zhn> never, oy left us
21:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> not but like i have seen comments
21:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> TODO: 0.8
21:59 < bridge> <zhn> they were TODO: 0.5
21:59 < bridge> <kollpotato> xD
21:59 < bridge> <zhn> and TODO: 0.6 and so on
22:00 < bridge> <zhn> current teeworlds codebase is really pretty though
22:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> can't wait for 1.0 to drop 2035
22:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> can't wait for 1.0 to drop 2055
22:00 < bridge> <zhn> 1.0 beta alpha 1838.rc
22:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> i would add 20 more years again
22:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> 0.6 is like 15 years old right
22:00 < bridge> <zhn> ~14
22:01 < bridge> <zhn> i still want to see old fat 0.5 strings
22:01 < bridge> <zhn> and to remove this clan field actually xd
22:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> we team up with chiller and make 0.8 protocol
22:08 < always> hi guys
22:09 < bridge> <alw5> worked

22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i never had that before lmao
22:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how do i restore my branch xD
22:17 < bridge> <alw5> did it delete your branch?
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i did literally nothing than a rebase and force push
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and github randomly closed the pr
22:18 < bridge> <alw5> well you closed it it says..
22:18 < bridge> <kebscs> it closes the pr when theres no changes
22:18 < bridge> <alw5> oh dam
22:19 < bridge> <zhn> we call it ddnet-rs protocol
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah interesting
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno what virus executed git reset here lmao
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> my history says i did a rebase xdd
22:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> yea
22:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> and we remove the uuids!!!!
22:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> and difference between game system messages
22:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> which is one bit
22:32 < bridge> <kollpotato> in the id

22:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why do you assume so
22:36 < bridge> <smetanolub> Thats not a cheat client
22:36 < bridge> <smetanolub> Cuz idk how it works
22:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> how do you know that
22:37 < bridge> <smetanolub> Its old client
22:37 < bridge> <smetanolub> And it has almost nothing in it
22:37 < bridge> <pioooooo> what new function
22:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> HAH I HAVE A STORY FOR YOU

22:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> all changes gone, had to cherrypick and force push aswell
22:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> so it wasnt my skill issue!
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why does it have control over my local git client tho
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with a rebase
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that sounds like a massive bug in git
22:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek: - yeah that absolutely shouldnt happen
22:50 < bridge> <kollpotato> no way more than 2 commits per pr

23:08 < bridge> <hectavoxel> im gonna strangle him
23:11 < bridge> <pioooooo> someone plz tell me how does the client know SvTeam
23:11 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329573740887150633/53cf8772f499df13.png?ex=678ad58a&is=6789840a&hm=4a630939ef7c02ded73809467d7c0a04a6890d257a77c628018872391353c968&

23:13 < bridge> <kebscs> i dont think it does, it just sends warnings when client does smth wrong
23:14 < bridge> <kebscs> for forced solo server just sets solo for client
23:14 < bridge> <pioooooo> it does know mandatory though
23:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> src/game/server/ddracechat:140
23:16 < bridge> <pioooooo> not what i mean i think
23:16 < bridge> <pioooooo> context #9542
23:16 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9542
23:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> ooh
23:16 < bridge> <pioooooo> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9542/files#diff-280befa9f251466e540dbf7829e2e3688512e0727ccfc3cfd7fc8cb87ce57542R749
23:18 < bridge> <pioooooo> here `Config()->m_SvTeam == SV_TEAM_MANDATORY` is true for team-required maps
23:18 < bridge> <pioooooo> but I cannot find where it is assigned
23:19 < bridge> <pioooooo> for solo servers it is not `SV_TEAM_FORCED_SOLO ` but instead default value `SV_TEAM_ALLOWED `
23:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> it's a server setting sent by the map basically
23:20 < bridge> <pioooooo> so the client also read the map settings?
23:20 < bridge> <pioooooo> let me check..
23:25 < bridge> <kebscs> yes thats why theres server settings button in map editor
23:25 < bridge> <kebscs> sv_solo_server for solo map
23:28 < bridge> <alw5> i just thought of this idea
23:29 < bridge> <alw5> then i forgot it
23:29 < bridge> <alw5> i am so smart
23:29 < bridge> <alw5> i was thinking i can devlop it
23:29 < bridge> <alw5> but i dont even know what it is
23:29 < bridge> <alw5> i was thinking i can develop it
23:29 < bridge> <pioooooo> :nouis:
23:29 < bridge> <alw5> this was gonna change ddnet
23:29 < bridge> <alw5> but i guess not today
23:30 < bridge> <pioooooo> i guess this is the case
23:30 < bridge> <pioooooo> why do we need SV_TEAM_FORCED_SOLO tho
23:30 < bridge> <alw5> ohh i just remembered
23:30 < bridge> <alw5> a command to read your saves
23:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7314
23:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
23:30 < bridge> <melo∆û> this utilizes SV_TEAM_FORCED_SOLO for example
23:30 < bridge> <alw5> on the map you are
23:30 < bridge> <alw5> idk where it would be tho
23:31 < bridge> <alw5> i want the ddnet-saves.txt to be readable in the game without opening the file
23:31 < bridge> <alw5> idk where ingame tho
23:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> f3
23:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kekw:
23:32 < bridge> <pioooooo> I mean why not just use m_SvSoloServer
23:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> f6 to open ddnet-saves.txt
23:33 < bridge> <alw5> truee
23:33 < bridge> <alw5> i was thinking a command
23:33 < bridge> <alw5> but that doesnt work
23:33 < bridge> <alw5> because its on the server
23:33 < bridge> <alw5> aint it
23:33 < bridge> <alw5> or something
23:33 < bridge> <alw5> no clientsided commands
23:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> well the only problem with that is that some moderators need to utilize the f keys, since these are the only keys that work in the serverbrowser
23:34 < bridge> <alw5> fuck the moderators
23:34 < bridge> <alw5> i want to open the ddnetsaves
23:34 < bridge> <alw5> where would i even put the code for this i have never developed in the ddnet codebase before
23:35 < bridge> <alw5> ive built before just never actually wrote anything
23:35 < bridge> <pioooooo> send shortcut to desktop
23:35 < bridge> <alw5> i have my desktop icons off
23:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> properly opening a file for all systems (windows, linux, mac) isn't that easy btw :kek: - you need to handle a lot of edge cases, add proper rendering etc.
23:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
23:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> my own client that i developed just had a single "open ddnet-saves" button in the DDNet tab which was neat
23:36 < bridge> <alw5> yeah
23:36 < bridge> <alw5> thats what i was thinking
23:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> properly opening a file for all systems (windows, linux, mac) isn't that easy btw :kek: - you need to handle a lot of edge cases, add proper text rendering with a scroll region etc.
23:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
23:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> my own client that i developed just had a single "open ddnet-saves" button in the DDNet tab which was neat
23:36 < bridge> <alw5> for my client
23:36 < bridge> <alw5> you can only use windows
23:36 < bridge> <alw5> unix not supported
23:36 < bridge> <alw5> posix only
23:36 < bridge> <kollpotato> query language for saves when
23:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> select from saves where map = "lonear"
23:37 < bridge> <alw5> Sql?
23:37 < bridge> <kollpotato> yeas
23:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> its called ctrl+f in any text editor and it's great.
23:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> no way
23:38 < bridge> <alw5> what text editor tho..
23:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> vim obviously
23:38 < bridge> <teero777> hmm??
23:38 < bridge> <kollpotato> the real text editor
23:38 < bridge> <teero777> It's / in any sane editor
23:38 < bridge> <kebscs> settings->general->settings file
23:38 < bridge> <kebscs> opens a file
23:38 < bridge> <kebscs> can do same for saves
23:38 < bridge> <alw5> yeah
23:38 < bridge> <alw5> would be nice
23:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> okay sorry. `:Telescope live_grep`
23:39 < bridge> <kollpotato> im so sleepy i read saves as slaves
23:39 < bridge> <kebscs> im guessing its cross platform since its already in ddnet
23:39 < bridge> <alw5> i was thinking something like a command in chat and it tells you what saves you have for the map
23:39 < bridge> <alw5> and you can load from that
23:41 < bridge> <alw5> ima try make it
23:41 < bridge> <teero777> better
23:41 < bridge> <alw5> should be simple.. right?
23:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> no
23:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> you will end up regretting it
23:42 < bridge> <alw5> nah
23:42 < bridge> <alw5> i found where it is
23:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> nice
23:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> gl
23:42 < bridge> <alw5> i got this
23:42 < bridge> <kollpotato> with nerdy ass programming language
23:43 < bridge> <melo∆û> dont forget to do your ddnet-rs contributions for 2025 people!

23:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> still a lot of stuff open! :owo:
23:45 < bridge> <alw5> where is the saves file defined
23:45 < bridge> <alw5> i assumed it would be SAVES_FILE or something
23:45 < bridge> <teero777> I will open #69
23:45 < bridge> <alw5> it is not
23:45 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/69
23:45 < bridge> <pioooooo> you can search in codespace
23:46 < bridge> <pioooooo> search the path
23:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> sorry - yoinked that

23:46 < bridge> <alw5> in visual studio?
23:46 < bridge> <alw5> ok
23:46 < bridge> <pioooooo> \ddnet\src\game\client\components\chat.cpp(579):#define SAVES_FILE "ddnet-saves.txt"
23:46 < bridge> <alw5> thanks
23:46 < bridge> <teero777> okay im making 351 prs
23:46 < bridge> <pioooooo> if you use visual studio should be ctrl+shift+f
23:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> this happened because jupsti erased the git history like 378239 times by forcepushing :kekw:
23:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> good choice
23:47 < bridge> <alw5> should i include the chat.h in menus_settings.cpp or is that bad
23:50 < bridge> <pioooooo> seems it's already included
23:50 < bridge> <pioooooo> :gigachad:
23:53 < bridge> <alw5> i did it
23:53 < bridge> <alw5> but not in a good way
23:54 < bridge> <alw5> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1329584509443637258/devenv_S4oow6AiO1.png?ex=678adf91&is=67898e11&hm=55c7aa732f00d123dc8809064a97c1ced51dccdd19ce9e14515c90f02fb3a85a&
23:55 < bridge> <alw5> if i just move `#define SAVES_FILE "ddnet-saves.txt"` to chat.h it should be fine right?
23:57 < bridge> <alw5> pr coming soon guys dont worry
