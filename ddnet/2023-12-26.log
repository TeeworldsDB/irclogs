06:04 < bridge> <baby frog> k so
06:04 < bridge> <baby frog> ive made a little bit of progress with this bug
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> ```if(g_Config.m_ClDummyControl)
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog>         {
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog>             CNetObj_PlayerInput *pDummyInput = &m_pClient->m_DummyInput;
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog>             pDummyInput->m_Jump = g_Config.m_ClDummyJump;
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog>             pDummyInput->m_Fire = g_Config.m_ClDummyFire;
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog>             pDummyInput->m_Hook = g_Config.m_ClDummyHook;
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog>         }```
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> theres something bad with this. i think this is whats happening:
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> 
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> when dummy control is enabled, it sets dummy m_Fire to 0 DIRECTLY. which i think is bad, because already with g_Config.m_ClDummyFire set to 0 it's already making a change to your dummy fire behavior.
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> 
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> so, i think this is what happens: if you have a bind like this: 
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> ```bind x +toggle cl_dummy_hammer 1 0```
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> and you PRESS that button but dont release it, it increases dummy m_Fire to 1...
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> THEN, the dummy control code sets it back to 0, simulating a release,
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> 
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> THEN, if you then RELEASE the dummy hammer button, it increases it AGAIN, to 1, which makes the dummy hammer again, and then of course the dummy control code sets it back to 0,
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> 
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> so, effectively, you have hammered twice, the first hammer being pressing down on the button and then again when releasing the button
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> so i think its a lil stupid
06:09 < bridge> <baby frog> to set pDummyInput->m_Fire directly to the config value
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog> ```if(g_Config.m_ClDummyControl)
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog>         {
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog>             CNetObj_PlayerInput *pDummyInput = &m_pClient->m_DummyInput;
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog>             pDummyInput->m_Jump = g_Config.m_ClDummyJump;
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog>             pDummyInput->m_Fire = g_Config.m_ClDummyFire;
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog>             pDummyInput->m_Hook = g_Config.m_ClDummyHook;
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog>         }```
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog> theres something bad with this. i think this is whats happening:
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog> 
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog> when dummy control is enabled, it sets dummy m_Fire to 0 DIRECTLY. which i think is bad, because already with g_Config.m_ClDummyFire set to 0 it's already making a change to your dummy fire behavior.
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog> 
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog> so, i think this is what happens: if you have a bind like this: 
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog> ```bind x +toggle cl_dummy_hammer 1 0```
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog> and you PRESS that button but dont release it, it increases dummy m_Fire to 1...

06:11 < bridge> <baby frog> 
06:11 < bridge> <baby frog> so, effectively, you have hammered twice, the first hammer being pressing down on the button and then again when releasing the button. however on the release of course the dummy does not hammer towards you, just in whatever direction its looking
06:14 < bridge> <baby frog> this is found on line ~300 of     ddnet/src/game/client/components/controls.cpp btw
06:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> isn't Server->Tick() gonna overflow if i run the server for a week ? what is going on ??? how large can it be ?
07:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> let me run the server till it hits +2147483647 to see what will happen üôÇ
08:21 < bridge> <teero777> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/d583b6d9bb953972d6c0fb8700d555c0cca6f0f0/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L2832C4-L2832C4
08:21 < bridge> <teero777> a MAX_TICK is defined so it doesnt happen :)
08:23 < bridge> <teero777> it will hit the MAX_TICK limit in about `10439.156616666667` hours
10:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and after that it force to load map to began the tick() from 0 again ?
10:50 < bridge> <teero777> seems like ti

12:40 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i show scores instead of time in my server ?
12:51 < ChillerDragon> when does the fakin llm hype arrive at git merge drivers
12:51 < ChillerDragon> cant be that 2023 git gets confused on a renamed method and throws a conflict
12:52 < ChillerDragon> @mamad_melanin remove flag time in gamecontroller and in player snap send the score
12:52 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/a9c316055f5d2579f6166152ec20c4241e0da456/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L600
12:52 < ChillerDragon> remove this
12:53 < ChillerDragon> replace this with your score logic https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/a9c316055f5d2579f6166152ec20c4241e0da456/src/game/server/player.cpp#L329-L350
12:53 < ChillerDragon> @mamad_melanin may i ask what you are working on? c: i am curious
12:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i wanna make a block mod just like you ‚ù§Ô∏è üòÑ
12:56 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> not exactly tho
12:56 < ChillerDragon> ah nice
12:57 < ChillerDragon> what should be different? :)
12:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i wanna make a system that the players could upgrade they weapon with they scores
12:59 < ChillerDragon> also bruv why does adding const to a method conflict that i did not even touch. Git is nice and all but could be so much better
12:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> upgrade theyr jetpack and grenade explosion
12:59 < ChillerDragon> @mamad_melanin i see
12:59 < ChillerDragon> you could also fork off ddnet++
12:59 < ChillerDragon> then you already have a shop system
13:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i couldn't get it compiled
13:00 < ChillerDragon> ah sadge
13:00 < ChillerDragon> well im here if you wanna give it another try if not also feel free to reinvent the wheel :D ddnet++ might have many bugs anyways
13:02 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i am new in programing, i just wanna change stuff around in ddnet src to learn a ltl ‚ù§Ô∏è
13:04 < ChillerDragon> yea makes sense. have fun c:
13:26 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ChillerDragon how to make vanilla teams in ddnet codebase any hints?
13:27 < bridge> <teero777> code
13:27 < bridge> <teero777> i think there are some flags you can set
13:28 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hmm
13:28 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I didn't find much in flags let me take another look though ;)
13:29 < bridge> <teero777> hmm
13:29 < bridge> <teero777> nvm
13:30 < ChillerDragon> @Mr.Gh0s7 wat u codin?
13:31 < ChillerDragon> ddfng?
13:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah
13:31 < ChillerDragon> do u use modern ddnet code base?
13:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah
13:31 < ChillerDragon> did you create a own game controller?
13:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :pepeH:
13:31 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I just edited the existing one
13:31 < ChillerDragon> u dont have to 
13:31 < ChillerDragon> eitherway go in your gamecontroller
13:31 < ChillerDragon> and set the flagteams
13:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> in gameinfoflags?
13:32 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ZillyInsta/ddnet-insta/blob/ba2bd1b15af7e396514272eb87cea08ce30b4403/src/game/server/gamemodes/ctf.cpp#L16
13:32 < ChillerDragon> dis
13:32 < ChillerDragon> might be in gamecontroller.cpp or ddrace.cpp for you
13:32 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ok thanks
13:32 < ChillerDragon> c:
13:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Thanks that did it :)
13:33 < ChillerDragon> ok i spent 1 hour solving git conflicts and feel like this will be all i do for 0.7 progress until the end of the year -.-
13:33 < ChillerDragon> fakin git
13:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Now I have to code the actual teams :)
13:34 < ChillerDragon> there isnt much to code iirc
13:34 < ChillerDragon> i think for me it just worked xd
13:34 < ChillerDragon> btw wat u workin on @Mr.Gh0s7
13:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ddfng
13:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ddnet_fng
13:34 < ChillerDragon> i already started with that
13:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> instead of dfng (differnt fng)
13:34 < bridge> <no_more1000_7> Hi guys, can you say, how make commands in chat?
13:35 < bridge> <no_more1000_7> on my server
13:35 < ChillerDragon> @no_more1000_7 ddracechat.h ddracechat.cpp
13:35 < bridge> <no_more1000_7> ty
13:35 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O
13:35 < ChillerDragon> @Mr.Gh0s7 any chance i could motivate you to join my project instead of building 10 different ddnet fng mods
13:35 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD It's not for me
13:35 < ChillerDragon> or you just wanna dabble
13:36 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Someone asked me about dfng thinking it was ddnet_fng so I offered to help them port fng to ddnet codebase without any further modifications
13:36 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> that sounds cool
13:36 < ChillerDragon> I am workin on this https://github.com/ZillyInsta/ddnet-insta which is merge conflict driven codebase i am planning to keep updating that with to modern ddnet for quite some time
13:37 < ChillerDragon> it currently supports gctf, ictf and zcatch and fng is work in progress
13:38 < ChillerDragon> it feels to me like every few years a new ddnet fork for pvp mods is built by some dude solo and then dies after a year again
13:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ikr :kek:
13:38 < ChillerDragon> i would love to have one big which is ready to use for everyone
13:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> f3
13:39 < bridge> <teero777> what?
13:39 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1189185833702543390/image.png?ex=659d3e9c&is=658ac99c&hm=60958551ba933abfc5f8d113ef19f91585ce7491d61b7bc5ae974091c13089b3&

13:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Even if you decide not to contribute to my project because collab is exhausting I recommend to base your project on mine instead of ddnet
13:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You get a bunch of useful stuff for free
13:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> 0 public contributors üôÇ
13:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Such as shuffle teams and so on
13:46 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I just ask if he wants to base it on ddnet-insta :)
13:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh and the blood sweat and tears I put into 0.6/0.7 support timelimits warmups gametimers and pause
13:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That wasn‚Äôt fun to do
13:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> To get started do sv\_gametype fng and put your code into fng.cpp
13:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ;)
13:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I am actively looking for contributers but getting something merged will be annoying since I have some ideas on how the codebase should look like
13:56 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw does the fng use the standard fng tiles?
14:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I did not add tiles yet
14:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> fng is currently just a shell
14:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I mean adding tiles and fng would be basically done :D
14:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hmm the way I've done it in dfng the spike tiles are elsewhere
14:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1189191237316644945/ddnet_fng.png?ex=659d43a5&is=658acea5&hm=b4daf994570374234246c6a31ad2c7a81860b3e622dccd80e69eb3ed9a542f24&
14:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> but that breaks the existing maps
14:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It will probably take some time until I find time to add tiles but then I intend to think about which indecies to use. Preferably some open standard or whatever is used the most
14:02 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ig there could be a fng and fng++ gamemode where the spikes are normal and the spikes are like the img I just sent
14:02 < bridge> <cyberfighter> mmm gummy spikes
14:02 < bridge> <cyberfighter> which flavour you taking
14:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So fng is basically empty in my codebase you just already have a instagib environment with kills scores rounds etc
14:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Then you can decide wether you want to write quick and dirty code or bud heads with me and write code that I will merge and maintain for you possibly for decades lol
14:04 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I would go with the second tbh
14:07 < ChillerDragon> okay then i have to warn you i want to find a non git conflicting way to add tiles to a ddnet codebase
14:08 < ChillerDragon> so we might have to wait for some prs in upstream. discuss with kaffeine and heinrich before anything progresses
14:08 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah np
14:08 < ChillerDragon> we can already draft the indecies tho
14:08 < ChillerDragon> maybe we should move elsewhere and not spam ddnet #developer
14:09 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ZillyInsta/ddnet-insta/issues/79
14:09 < ChillerDragon> ^
14:10 < ChillerDragon> indices such a hard word xd
14:11 < ChillerDragon> > The plural of index is indexes or indices.
14:37 < ChillerDragon> omg now i get segfaults with different backtraces everytime
14:37 < ChillerDragon> maintaining #5949 is such a pain -.- i really need this to be merged soon for my mental health
14:43 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> like in fng's
14:44 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> like in fng
14:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i can't find any useful method for that in CCaracter class
14:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i keep track of indirect kills ? example: "someone hook another tee and then kill him with spike"
14:55 < ChillerDragon> you have to code that your self
14:55 < ChillerDragon> keep track of who hooked who and on death check if thats set
14:56 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i can use gamecore.h i thing but the server will be easily hackable
14:57 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> right ?
14:57 < ChillerDragon> yes gamecore
14:57 < ChillerDragon> no not easily hackable
14:58 < ChillerDragon> tw protocol is secure by design the client only sends inputs
14:58 < ChillerDragon> gamecore is shared code for prediction reasons but the client never sends state the server uses for actual physics 
14:58 < ChillerDragon> pChar->Core()->m_HookedPlayer i store this boi in character.cpp
14:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> oh yes
14:59 < ChillerDragon> for every tee i store who it was last touched by and update that on damage and if hookedplayer is set
15:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> let me try reimplement it, sounds fun
15:02 < ChillerDragon> enjoy segfaults when it was a regular selfkill axaxaxax
15:02 < ChillerDragon> also make sure your server does not explode if a tee gets blocked and the killer already left when the victim suicides
15:03 < ChillerDragon> also make sure to unset the lasttoucher after some delay
15:03 < ChillerDragon> otherwise getting hooked by someone and then selfkilling 2hours later counts as kill :D
15:03 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just wanna give credit to one that freeze the tee first, make sense
15:03 < ChillerDragon> ah you credit on freeze not on kill 
15:04 < ChillerDragon> i see
15:04 < ChillerDragon> still the killer could leave before the victim hits the freeze thats a classic crashbug
15:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just check every pointer :DDD
15:04 < ChillerDragon> i personally dislike the credit on freeze because that counts ddracing with a friend as murdering each other
15:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i want to give point in every small things like, freeze someone, unfreeze someone, kill, ...
15:06 < ChillerDragon> ah cool
15:06 < ChillerDragon> are you planning to host btw? planning to open source?
15:06 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and punish the people for unfreezing they friends with laser. it's so annoying
15:06 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i wanna host it, but there is no point to make it open source, even me can't read my code
15:09 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> after gathering some skill, i make a clean mod and then yes, opensource
15:09 < ChillerDragon> cool
15:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i changed my avatar :feelsamazingman:

18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki ever used https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ?
18:04 < bridge> <avolicious> I am not sure if people are interested in answering it in here, but there you go.
18:04 < bridge> <avolicious> 
18:04 < bridge> <avolicious> In gRPC you are able to create a long running bidirectional ( bidi ) stream with `stub->AsyncEventStream(&context_, &this->cq_, reinterpret_cast<void*>(gRPC::Type::CONNECT));`
18:05 < bridge> <avolicious> 
18:05 < bridge> <avolicious> This works great until there is a network problem & the stream stops sending or receiving data. There is a built-in grpc-core reconnect & keepalive feature, but it doesnt restart the stream.
18:05 < bridge> <avolicious> 
18:05 < bridge> <avolicious> How would you solve the problem?
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> how can u ask that
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> ofc
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> its the go to for logging
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> even outside async
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> the predecessor is "log"
18:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> but tracing is better
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it's not zero-costable?
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. i dont see a feature to disable it if i dont need it
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> no it has some cost but not much
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u want zero or near zero cost logging
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need specialized crates
18:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i doubt its a source of bottleneck tho xd
18:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think it may have some debug macros
18:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> that only get compiled in debug mode
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but why should i compile it in, if i only need it as dev üòÑ
18:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
18:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> dev only dep?
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but i still have to use their macros all the time
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> bro idk
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> either u use a crate or not
18:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:18 < bridge> <reitw> @avolicious damn kodekloud to learn k8s is amazingly good, do you have any certification btw ?
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but it could easily do a no-opt macro
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and only enable the real macro with a feature on
18:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but it could easily do a no-op macro
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can do it urself
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> u make the dep optional
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> and put it behind a feature on UR crate
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> and u can do
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> cargo r --feature with-logger
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u named the feature with-logger
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
18:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but then i have to do it xddd
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> u have to do it
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> it doesnt make sense for tracing itself
18:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> to do a feature which disables itself
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> this is done on the one using it
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> tracing would do that on a costly dependency it has
18:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> but not itself XD
18:21 < bridge> <avolicious> Next year I will do some, because new job üòÑ
18:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what function is called every time a tee dies or suicide or get spiked or say /kill
18:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i know this one ```cpp
18:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> pPlayer->KillCharacter(WEAPON_SELF);
18:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
18:59 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> witch i think is for kill protection ones, how about other ones ?
19:01 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i having hard time finding functions in general, any suggestions ?
19:02 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just search the whole source code with some name in my minds like "kill"
19:04 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just search the whole source code with some names in my mind like "kill"
19:10 < bridge> <kaffeine0> `CCharacter::Die()`? It is called by `CPlayer::KillCharacter()`.
19:10 < bridge> <kaffeine0> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/c906c43e38d67ba7be0f988fe329d554d37e1052/src/game/server/player.cpp#L579
19:23 < bridge> <learath2> I like to go from observable stuff. If there is a server message, look for that. If there is a sound look for that e.g.
19:23 < bridge> <learath2> But with experience you kinda learn where everything is
19:31 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i learned so nice with this method in the past 5 days, but i need to see the function calls elsewhere in the src every time i wanna write it again, my memory is killing me
19:34 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Do you use an IDE? You found `pPlayer->KillCharacter`, so you could go to the `KillCharacter()` method, see `Die()`  there, find the usage (I mean IDE action) and realize that this is what you want.
19:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i use vscode just for editing and using MSYS2 to compile the src
19:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but my vscode doesn't highlight everything is the src, i just can mostly use it for going to classes(not the members) and header files :D, i couldn't configure it
19:41 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if i wanna see implementation of the member function or something i just search it in the whole src
19:42 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> if i wanna see implementation of the member function or something i just search it in the whole src tree
19:42 < bridge> <milkeeycat> how about u configure ur code editor to make ur life easier?
19:44 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just ask it here :justatest:
19:44 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i use ed btw
19:45 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is it easy to find what you want in it ?
19:49 < bridge> <kaffeine0> > i having hard time finding functions in general, any suggestions ?
19:49 < bridge> <kaffeine0> Ok, then "configure the project" is `#0`. Also, I'd use MSVC as the compiler (if I'd be using Windows).
19:53 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yes, it very high end, modern code editor
19:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> I planing to change to linux and using vim, but yes i need to configure this soon

19:56 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and to ddnet as well!!!
20:13 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the only shortcuts i used so far is: crtl + shift + f   and  ctrl + f
20:13 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> only
20:32 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i debug my server when it's running
20:35 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> segmentation fault :feelsbadman:
20:35 < bridge> <kekomonter> Try to use IDE's like vscode and jetbrains products (CLion for C/C++)
21:06 < bridge> <learath2> @murpi can you take a look at this? You are a dummy magician, you might know if it breaks sth
22:08 < ChillerDragon> ryo contributed to rust?
22:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that really a question
22:09 < ChillerDragon> yes
22:09 < ChillerDragon> he writes rust code but did he contribute to the rust project it self?
22:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ryo doesnt write rust code. he breaths rust code
22:10 < ChillerDragon> yeye link or didnt happen
22:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki link your contribution
22:10 < ChillerDragon> xd
22:11 < ChillerDragon> @avolicious arent cool kids using quic for robust connections?
22:11 < bridge> <avolicious> But this are two different topics?
22:12 < ChillerDragon> idk i neither tried quic nor gRPC
22:12 < ChillerDragon> was just wondering if you could wrap one in the other or some shit
22:12 < bridge> <avolicious> gRPC is for Remote Procedure Calls, QUIC is a protocol built on top of UDP
22:12 < bridge> <avolicious> Well, theoretically you could
22:12 < bridge> <avolicious> You need to rewrite gRPC then, because its heavily built upon HTTP2
22:13 < ChillerDragon> i see
22:13 < ChillerDragon> sounds bad
22:13 < ChillerDragon> @reitw when did kodekloud get mentioned?
22:21 < bridge> <reitw> why that question
23:43 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You mentioned it as if it was mentioned before. I did not see the previous message. I am questioning my reading skills or bridge functionality
23:44 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I do not understand the context of this message
23:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> Chillerdragon https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113616
23:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Epic
23:47 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Didn‚Äôt know
