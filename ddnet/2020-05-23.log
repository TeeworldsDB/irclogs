00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hi [R]
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `/enablecheats` is a long name, maybe `/practice`?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can we make it so that one person can't accidentally trigger it for the whole team?
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps a majority vote (by people typing /practice)
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 /practice sounds very unclear to me, I wouldn't know what it means
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 should we also have the same for lock and invite?
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> invite doesn't change gameplay, no need to vote
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> lock is more tricky, died a lot of times because people falling into the void and everyone lock/unlocking at the sametime
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe /unlock would be nice
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> there is /lock
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> /lock 0
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> to unlock explicitly
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> toh
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> nobody knows about that
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, now that I think about it I guess I agree
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk what we should do about enablecheats, maybe something like kill protection?
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because it's essentially killing the run
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> /lock /unlock triple times more user friendly IMO. Does kill protection affects teams in case its locked and somebody died? If no, it would be nice to have
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay nope, and I don't think that's possible since it would mean stopping the server until the team decided
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay i guess the idea was that with lock/unlock you can't have a single bind for both uses
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @BannZay I added it now
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (in the same pr)
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> thx, deen, it should make life of new players easier. I just has this problem at the begining
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 too late, now I renamed it to practice mode, because cheating is never ok (or something like that)
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like "practice"
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 i added the voting btw
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I just saw it in the diff
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> @deen , about kill protection for team, could we keep died players in spectactor mode till team decides/timer ends? If it technically possible
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's a thing that should probably be implemented for normal mode, too â€“ tees that get killed after finish should die and go to spectator mode
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (currently they don't die from death tiles, but from out-of-world kills, resulting in botched finishes because some tees exit the map too quickly causing the team to die)
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds fine, I made an issue since i won't work on it
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks ðŸ™‚
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That was a quick implementation of voting, would have taken me atleast 2-3 hours ðŸ˜„
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thanks deen, I think it looks good from a feature point of view now
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think `m_WishesPractice` needs to be reset to false when changing teams
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also one more thing I can think about is someone leaving the team. E.g. we have 7 people 3 wishes practice, if 2 people leave now a majority wants practice but it still won't pass
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it will pass once one of them types /practice again
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds better than automatic passing, even
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 true
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Btw, why do I get the "Do you know someone who uses a bot?" message when joining my dummy
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> never got it before
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's in full servers where the id mappings are not the same between dummy and main, I think
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I don't see any commits that'd break that
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i thought so too but the server wasn't full, only had 40 players
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why would id mappings be different ever? we do support 64 players
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> >16 would trigger it
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *can trigger it
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, you mean because the server doens't know yet if i have ddnet client
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i see
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heh, the early version thing would help
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my thoughts exactly ðŸ˜„
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> indeed
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is quite an extensive change though, I constantly feel like I'm missing something while going through it
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the idea was simple ðŸ˜¦
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With the way we use the version all over the place, it couldn't ever have a small footprint
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I still save the version in only one place at least, nothing can get out of sync
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sometimes I wonder maybe we should start dropping a bit of this compatibility
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like the old extended serverinfo protocol, are there even any surviving clients using that?
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> probably ddnet.tw/status is using it
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or `VERSION_DDNET_WHISPER = 217` do we ever see a version older then this anyway?
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even 707 is probably quite rare to ever be spotted in the wild
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The crashmeplx stuff
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > I think `m_WishesPractice` needs to be reset to false when changing teams
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 Done
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gave you a review
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> would be cool if holding jump allowed you to autojump without using dj
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For that one Konsti might actually put a hit out on me
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> lol why
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <<BÂµmM>> what do u mean
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Btw, how about disabling the message of who killed team in case you're in solo team?
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu how to trigger that message?
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because i don't see it when playing with 1 player
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @deen Sorry, seems that I yet again mistook that some things works same way on DDNet & KoG servers >.>
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> looks liek KoG changed something in this case, np
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ye, on KoG when you join team, pass startline and kill you get `*** Everyone in your locked team was killed because you killed.`
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @qshar fix it ^ xD
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> @Soreu can you write me in PM the problem, I'll try to fix
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> was so lazy that just pinged you there xd
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> we have a different source, so ye - there might be some big difference
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <qshar> ye, I see it
