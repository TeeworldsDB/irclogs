00:04 < bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> at least on this server: 185.107.94.201:8313
00:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> u must be in the data center
00:30 < bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> how cold is it?

01:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Nouaa> hello i can create vote that execute chat command like /spec or oher custom cmd directly in autoexec?
01:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> A vote can't do /spec
01:11 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Votes can run server commands and server settings as listed here, not chat commands: https://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/
11:52 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Raidon> I want to make a client and would it be a problem if I type it on the ddnet client?
11:57 < bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> No problem
12:26 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Raidon> ty
15:22 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> When are we making teaching python to kids a war crime?
15:23 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I prefer kids learning python+numpy to kids learning matlab
16:00 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~self include~~

16:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> make it two files ðŸ˜‰
16:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> already had `weapon.h` and `weapons.h`, don't really want a `weapon_types.h`
16:03 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i'll change it if it breaks. it seems to work just fine
16:07 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Night_L> Hi, the font is fixed but the number in entity tiles are much sharper in latest client. But I don't like it. Is there setting to revert this?

16:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I feel like this is asking for trouble ðŸ˜› @TsFreddie
16:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. what if you want this inside of your function, but haven't included the file beforehand
16:14 < bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then you suddenly have a local enum declaration in your function
16:18 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> true
16:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> what if I do this :kek:
16:29 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/840596341171814400/unknown.png
16:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> whats bad about python :justatest:
16:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> who said that
16:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> found it
16:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I prefer kids not learning programming at all.
16:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> more jobs for us ez
16:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> altho right now thats not a problem
16:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
16:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Night_L> Python's good, but anyone has a clue of reverting the sharp number in entity tiles? I like the blur one in old clients
16:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Night_L> feel uncomfortable when moving in high speed. those numbers flick and hurt my eyes :<
16:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @Jupstar âœª might know, but i doubt it is configurable.
16:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> You can turn off numbers entirely tho
16:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> maybe toggle it when you needed it
16:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> people who put dots at end of phrases in chats :justatest:
16:37 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> .
16:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> :justatest:
16:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> python best
16:38 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Night_L> k, that's a solution, but I am hoping to see a setting or something perm to fix this. Old clients are good except slow server loading
16:39 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Night_L> I am sick of the loading but can not get used to the latest :<   too old to change
16:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @Jupstar âœª btw i think the size setting of text entities is broken, at least in 15.4
16:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @Night_L i think you can turn the number smaller, they look less sharp when it is small
16:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> you need to restart the game to have the size applied, just tried it
16:42 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Night_L> ok, I am checking this out. I have no idea what I can config bf4
16:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Night_L> the default setting is max size
16:44 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Night_L> but still smaller (and sharper) comparing to legacy client
16:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Night_L> emm, I guess they are the same size. just sharper. the comparison:
16:45 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Night_L> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/840600394261463111/unknown.png
16:46 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Night_L> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/840600547836690462/unknown.png
16:47 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Night_L> the upper is the latest, the lower is the legacy. I would say the legacy is pretty blurred but looks cozier to me :<
16:48 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Night_L> the setting is exactly the same since they are using the same config file
17:32 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> True, programming and related activities are bad for development. Maybe we should make programming 18+ like alcohol
17:33 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> My mom did hired a tutor to teach me Pascal when I was 11 tho
17:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Kinda hated how my brain works rn.
17:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> not sure if it is related lol
17:34 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> ðŸ˜›
17:35 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Also I can't look at Pascal now. The syntax makes me cringe.
17:36 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> And all my old pascal code has 1 space indents, I have no idea why
17:40 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://github.com/TsFreddie/minesweeper-pas/blob/master/minesweeper.pas
17:41 < bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I cleaned this one up a bit and put it on GitHub last year, feel free to ruin your eyes
23:01 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> any rust enjoyers, this is a good read https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog/blob/master/posts/common-rust-lifetime-misconceptions.md
23:02 < bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> I didn't really made it, but what's broken about it?
