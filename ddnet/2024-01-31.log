06:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> a) error
06:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> b) 1

06:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @melo∆û i got you bro https://zillyhuhn.com/crack/bam4
07:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat lmao nice https://github.com/MilkeeyCat/deez_bridge
08:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
08:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: im proud of that name
09:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> So far i spent most of the time to find a working irc docker image
09:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> eww why docker @milkeeycat 
09:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean to run a server for testing? or to run your client lib in a container? 
09:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i aint installing real irc server on my machine
09:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why not?
09:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> coz that shit is gonna install smth in /etc
09:25 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i can just run docker compose up and it will work
09:25 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> watfak no?
09:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> docker and docker compose will put stuff in /etc
09:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> docker is the worst
09:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just run https://github.com/jrosdahl/miniircd
09:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> at least use podman :p
09:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can also test stuff on quakenet
09:26 < bridge> <jxsl13> :banhammer:
09:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it already can send messages üòÑ
09:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats poggies
09:27 < bridge> <milkeeycat> so probably i can bridge my discord sever and #ddnet-off-topic
09:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> soon new bridge for #developer <:poggers2:1008007455936094328>
09:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> btw
09:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i was confused about how irc works
09:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> so basically u join a server
09:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> quakenet for example
09:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> and u can make own channel
09:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
09:28 < bridge> <milkeeycat> like `/join #foo`
09:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
09:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> does it get removed when u leave?
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> define removed xd
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> whats the different between removed and empty?
09:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can also create your self a channel on chat.zillyhuhn.com here https://github.com/discord-irc/irc-websockets/blob/91135aaa4e2062dbfd1e85cb0113b1f3558feb27/src/bridge_connections.ts
09:29 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ok, another question does #ddnet-off-topic always have anyone in it?
09:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the client of chat.zillyhuhn.com is mostly in there and my bouncer
09:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but its same vps so on reboot its empty
09:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat idk much about irc tbh. But i think on quakenet the first joiner of a channel can take some ownership. And when he rejoins he can request that from Q bot again
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> might be that if the channel gets fully empty for a while that someone else can claim ownership again idk
09:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not sure if the irc spec even has such things defined. I could image that depends on your network
09:44 < bridge> <TsFreddie> is irc cool again
09:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i just wanted to make something in go
09:47 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea im workin on the backend rn
09:47 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i connect my bot in 10 tries ;-;
09:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> why go
09:48 < bridge> <TsFreddie> isn't this a rust household
09:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i like go
09:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> go daddy

12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> hi from eu
12:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> time to upgrade 1 week old gentoo
12:41 < bridge> <Ewan> hi
12:42 < bridge> <Ewan> the guy with the egpu still didn‚Äôt respond
13:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 TIL if u dont update for long its recommended to pass --backtrack=1000 or smth high to portage
13:15 < bridge> <learath2> Yep, it's a good idea
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah there is also --keep-going
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 is it related?
13:16 < bridge> <learath2> Not exactly, but it can help when you have some dependency update loop
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> should i add backtrack=10 to my daily upgrade script? xcd
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> the one i run when i wake up
13:18 < bridge> <learath2> No point to it if you are running it daily
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning routine:
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> - coffee
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> - boot up gentoo
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> - upgrade
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> - gym
13:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> went to sleep at 7 and woke up 15 mins ago today
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> feels bad
13:19 < bridge> <learath2> You only really need to bump up backtrack if something breaks
13:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok
13:20 < bridge> <learath2> Wher breakfast?
13:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> after gym
13:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> well i take some protein with my coffee
13:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> but its better to not eat
13:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> before gym
13:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> so u dont puke or smth
13:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> also its odd but i never feel like having breakfast before xd
13:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> i prefer to eat more at dinner
13:43 < bridge> <learath2> Understandable. Working out with a full stomach is very meh

15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> deflate: 415078 - 415013, gz: 415096 - 415031, zlib: 415084 - 415031, lz4: 1124876, brotli: 165840, zstd: 228700 - 191730
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> brotli wins against everything in my use case, even when i set compression to best
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how does it manage to be so good?
15:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i should add lzma too üòÑ
15:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wowo
15:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> someone mentioned it in a tech talk i went to o.O
15:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> didnt expect it to be actually good xd
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> deflate: 415078 - 415013, gz: 415096 - 415031, zlib: 415084 - 415031, lz4: 1124876, brotli: 165840, zstd: 228700 - 191730, lzma: 179541 - 178466
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it even wins against lzma
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lmao, i didnt expect that
15:41 < bridge> <sedonya> Which function adds quotes before and after nickname if there are spaces in nickname? (When search nickname in chat by clicking ``tab``)
15:43 < bridge> <devinci24> lmao I was looking at this yesterday. May you tell me speed wise if it's even slower than lzma? Or is it actually decently fast (compared to gz or zlib)
15:44 < bridge> <furo321> I believe brotli uses a pretty big dictionary of a lot of common words/terms, which I believe can help quite a lot if you're benchmarking with small files. I think you can create custom dictionaries with zstd as well, but it doesn't have one by default.
15:45 < bridge> <furo321> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7535/files>
15:45 < bridge> <sedonya> ty <3
15:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's as fast as deflate algorithms, so basically the fastest around
15:46 < bridge> <devinci24> wtf. actually insane
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> interesting that this improves it so much, bcs my data is fully binary, no text ^^
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but maybe repeating patterns match very well tho
15:50 < bridge> <furo321> Oh, binary data? In that case, I don't think it helps at all.
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i could probably test a custom dictionary at some point, but dunno if i really want to have one
15:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> defeats general purpose
15:51 < bridge> <avolicious> We use it for cold-storage backups

15:52 < bridge> <avolicious> We use it (brotli) for cold-storage backups
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for tw demos i used lzma2 at max for now, i should try and see if brotli is better for that too üòÑ
15:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the uncompressed size is 206437961 btw. so the data is mostly empty, else the compression ratio wouldnt be so insanely high üòÑ

These figures contrast with those of Germany (-0.3%), France (0%), Sweden (0.1%) and Austria (0.2%). What was observed in the final quarter of the year is part of a trend that has been observed since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

The Spanish economy is now 9.8% larger than in the fourth quarter of 2019 (the last one before the pandemic); Portugal's GDP is 10.8% higher, Italy's is 7.7% above and Greece's (no data yet for the fourth quarter) is 8.6% higher than then.

19:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is that interesting to us?
19:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure tbh
19:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> it uses macos 14
19:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> we can deprecate old macos <14
19:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> which is the non m1
19:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> and then use c++17 features (yes, macos <14 claims c++17 support but doesnt implement everything)
19:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that seems unrelated to the runner and more related to the minimum mac version we want to support, no

19:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> macos is an insult to your precious life time
19:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> it is

19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki u should never be a fan of anyone or anything
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> secret life tip
19:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Justar ftw
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki let's start:
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Rust sucks
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
19:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Jupstar ftw
19:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> who r you, random
19:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I'm a ghost!
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üëª
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well the unicode for it sucks xD
19:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ü•ºüé©
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but ur hat is important
19:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah plus my cloth is from a labcoat ;)
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 u here
19:46 < bridge> <robyt3> yes
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do you also have the feeling that strtoints 
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/984457a48e112d27e51623a40c2971fa2fe5053a/src/game/gamecore.h#L83
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is buggy?
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's missing a & 0xff after the +128 calculation
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs the other way around it does that
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/984457a48e112d27e51623a40c2971fa2fe5053a/src/game/gamecore.h#L96-L99
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for me it fails on this input:
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> "Teleport fxÔøΩ"
19:47 < bridge> <ikeed> is community a new word for hoster?
19:48 < bridge> <robyt3> Is that supposed to be valid? It contains a replacement character for me
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> according to rust it is
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üòÇ
19:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but still, isnt it weird that we don't "clamp" the int?
19:48 < bridge> <robyt3> I'm not very sure about those functions, we don't have any tests for them right now
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it can "write" into the other bytes
19:49 < bridge> <robyt3> It uses `aBuf` which is `char` so I guess it doesn't need to clamp or AND?
19:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it gets upcasted to int
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and then +128 can go out of range of unsigned char
19:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so in a worst case it "writes" into the other bytes
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or i don't understand smth important here
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh signed char vs unsigned char probably?
19:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well then it's probably correct
19:52 < bridge> <robyt3> Definitely confusing enough that we needed to silence a related compiler warning
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is there one?
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah yeah
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the ifdef block xd
19:52 < bridge> <robyt3> `#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Warray-bounds"`
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that's above what i meant
19:52 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `char` is signed on most platforms
19:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah it's simply c not defining char as signed or unsigned
19:53 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yup
19:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> who in this world even decided that it's good that it's not defined
19:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's just the C way to do things, I guess
19:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i already hate that i have to deal with strtoints xddd
19:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that function is indeed weird üò¶
19:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we inherited it, I think
19:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> defs, it's used inside the map format
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @robyt3 do you know why there are maps with invalid utf8?
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like how did this even happen in first place?
19:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did they develop on ARM? XD
19:57 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't think the functions checks for valid UTF-8, so it might be one of the remaining way to get invalid UTF-8 into the client
19:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
19:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Initially UTF-8 wasn't used consistently when the filename comes from the OS, so ANSI filenames containing umlauts are considered as invalid UTF-8
19:58 < bridge> <robyt3> At least from the maps with invalid UTF-8 that Patiga found it looks like that
19:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yea, because we didn't have correct handling for non-ascii filenames on windows at first
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can patigas map tool print in json?
19:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga can i serialize to json?
20:01 < bridge> <patiga> most things yea
20:01 < bridge> <patiga> not the entire thing to one json object though
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with which tool?
20:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there are so many
20:01 < bridge> <patiga> `twmap-edit --mapdir INPUT_PATH OUTPUT_PATH`
20:02 < bridge> <patiga> thats the "mapdir" format
20:02 < bridge> <patiga> most things are json files
20:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah interesting, it makes it structured
20:10 < bridge> <patiga> its especially useful to diff maps
20:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga next time you sleep, dream of zlib license.
20:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That would have saved me some headache xd
20:25 < bridge> <patiga> :heartw:
20:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> im a fan of the best current available  language
20:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that sounds pragmatic
20:40 < bridge> <jxsl13> has anyone here worked with postgres' inet/cidr datatypes before?
20:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> haven't
20:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> if anyone has, my question: is it possible to merge overlapping ip ranges to always  have a minimal set of ranges?
20:41 < bridge> <jxsl13> maybe postgres is the wrong tool
20:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I find the question underspecified
20:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can test whether one cidr is a subset of another in postgres using `>>=`
20:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if so, you can drop the one that is a subset
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well if i'm not wrong a \0 char is encoded as 128 (bcs of the +128)
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but:
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/984457a48e112d27e51623a40c2971fa2fe5053a/src/game/gamecore.h#L89
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just strips it as zero
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but zero is not the same as \0 here, because of the +- 128
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think that's why i get so many invalid utf8s in my case
21:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. patigas tool strips the zeros before applying the +-128 offset
21:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah yea, that bit is inconsistent
21:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you have to ignore the last byte
21:02 < bridge> <learath2> Is there anyone here that knows their way around C++ templates?
21:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what is a way around c++ templates?
21:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's your question?
21:02 < bridge> <learath2> I kinda ran out of tricks üòÑ
21:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i used them heavily in the past, but i got extremly bad in cpp :lol:
21:03 < bridge> <chairn> what you trying to do ?
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/406f45ad4df6038b91f3f4f666b3adfe0e19906f/map/src/format.rs#L612
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I also simply strip the last byte
21:05 < bridge> <learath2> ```c++
21:05 < bridge> <learath2> template <typename T, typename PR = void, typename = typename std::enable_if_v<std::is_invocable<T> || std::is_invocable<T, PR>>>
21:05 < bridge> <learath2> struct invocable {
21:05 < bridge> <learath2>   template<typename = typename std::enable_if_v<std::is_invocable<T>>>
21:05 < bridge> <learath2>   using result_t = std::invoke_result_t<T>;
21:05 < bridge> <learath2> 
21:05 < bridge> <learath2>   template<typename = typename std::enable_if_v<std::is_invocable<T, PR>>>
21:05 < bridge> <learath2>   using result_t = std::invoke_result_t<T, PR>;
21:05 < bridge> <learath2> };
21:05 < bridge> <learath2> ```
21:05 < bridge> <learath2> This is invalid C++, but it should kinda illustrate what I'm trying to do
21:06 < bridge> <chairn> || with = is defined ?
21:06 < bridge> <learath2> I'm trying to extract the return type from either an `std::invocable<T>` or an `std::invocable<T, PR>` for some PR
21:06 < bridge> <chairn> ah misread it
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wow typename = typename?
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i've never seen that i think xd
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that basically a contraint on typename or what
21:07 < bridge> <learath2> It's just how I like to do SFINAE, an anonymous type template argument
21:07 < bridge> <learath2> with a default type
21:08 < bridge> <learath2> oh those are supposed to be `enable_if_t`s sorry
21:09 < bridge> <learath2> I messed around with C++20 concepts too but I couldn't really get it to pan out with those either. I'm starting to think maybe I want something that's just not possible to begin with
21:14 < bridge> <chairn> what you trying to do ? A struct to invoke some function statically ?
21:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> postgres does not seem to have anything for my use case. what I wanted is arbitrary ranges to be merged into a combined range. I have ip lists that may contain duplicates which could be deduplicated and combined into a (somewhat) smallest set of ranges
21:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> postgres does not seem to have anything for my use case. what I wanted is arbitrary ranges to be merged into a combined range. I have ip lists that may contain duplicates which should be deduplicated and combined into a (somewhat) smallest set of ranges
21:15 < bridge> <learath2> kinda  yeah
21:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> postgres does not seem to have anything for my use case. what I wanted is arbitrary ranges to be merged into a combined range. I have ip lists that may contain duplicates which should be deduplicated and combined into a (somewhat) smallest set of ip ranges
21:16 < bridge> <learath2> it's really hard for me to tell you what I'm doing because I really don't know myself, I'm just figuring out what pieces I have at hand to make a promise/future system
21:18 < bridge> <learath2> I know I need to handle both `std::invocable<T>` and `std::invocable<T, PR>`s, so that if the result of a futures type matches the next futures input they can be chained
21:19 < bridge> <learath2> So a generic way to extract either ones return type is what I was digging around
21:19 < bridge> <chairn> seems beyond my knowledge, sorry üôÇ
21:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 have u seen the movie akira
21:20 < bridge> <learath2> I guess I'll just google around randomly for cool looking template trickery until I find something inspiring. It's hard to even google for this stuff
21:20 < bridge> <learath2> nope
21:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do it
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> then u will question how in the 88 they did such superb animations
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> also its a movie that leaves u thinking wtf did i just watch
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
21:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> very cyberpunk
21:36 < bridge> <StormAh~> basicly question for everyone, how does update.json looks like? does someone have an example?

21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
21:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @fokkonaut yep it's already fixed, but needs a manual update this time
21:51 < bridge> <learath2> not yet :/
21:51 < bridge> <learath2> 18.0.3 is needed to fix it
21:51 < bridge> <learath2> current master has it fixed
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think deen released a patch for it
21:51 < bridge> <learath2> oh, did deen replace 18.0.2?
21:51 < bridge> <learath2> If he did, then all is fine
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> here
21:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think 18.0.2 is only your patch xD
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wowo @bencie. evil
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> stealing newbies the prs
21:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
21:55 < bridge> <bencie.> Im a newbie too!
21:55 < bridge> <bencie.> üò¨
21:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> damn, i swear he was about to do it >:(
21:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> i hyped im up for it aswell >:(
21:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> i hyped em up for it aswell >:(
22:00 < bridge> <baby frog> if I am asking this question, it means i am getting desperate: Hi, i have a question. i've been working for a few days on this, but not making much progress - is there any way to pause the game tick, and then be able to resume? The closest i have right now is calling the TickPaused() for all entities when i want to do so, but the gameticks are still going up in this case. it doesn't need to be an in-depth answer, just some clues or hints would be
22:01 < bridge> <robyt3> There is a pause state for the entire game (used with `pause_game` command) but I'm not sure how well it's tested
22:02 < bridge> <learath2> Unless I missed something, 18.0.2 does not include #7871 which actually fixed the issue
22:02 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7871
22:03 < bridge> <learath2> #7868 turned out not to be enough
22:03 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7868
22:03 < bridge> <bencie.> don't worry, now he's forced to push his boundries and he'll be the best dev here!
22:03 < bridge> <baby frog> that's interesting, thank you! üôÇ
22:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> tbf he didnt even fork it yet, he might have forgotten about it :kek:
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 but this commit suggests otherwise
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 3594eb4 Fix updater issue. Close #7867 - Learath2
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it might be your initial commit tho
22:07 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/7867
22:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but that also fixes it
22:10 < bridge> <learath2> It's not that complicated though, I thought I fixed it, wasn't fixed
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah lol, what was the additional fix?
22:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am highly confused
22:13 < bridge> <robyt3> #7871
22:13 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7871
22:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dont understand that either, but maybe i also dont have to understand it üòÇ
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did we download the server or what
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:14 < bridge> <robyt3> You mean the fix? Looks like classic copy&paste error
22:15 < bridge> <robyt3> if(client_update) download_server()
22:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when was the updater even changed at all üòÑ
22:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i thought it's untouched since years
22:17 < bridge> <robyt3> The first bug was caused by reordering the includes it seems, because we don't follow strict IWYU
22:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yep
22:17 < bridge> <learath2> It was changed along with curl-multi, to fix the undefined behaviour introduced in the wider http rework made way back when
22:17 < bridge> <robyt3> The other bug was introduced in curl-multi AFAICT
22:18 < bridge> <robyt3> So it's not required to add to the fix to 18.0
22:18 < bridge> <learath2> ?
22:18 < bridge> <learath2> 18.0 does have curl-multi, no?
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
22:18 < bridge> <robyt3> https://github.com/Learath2/ddnet/commit/32e968335b08cb959fd3d4c494135ce93b7ad046
22:18 < bridge> <robyt3> This added the copy&paste error
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 else we'd have gotten endless reports for broken skins xd
22:19 < bridge> <learath2> This was part of the curl multi pr, how could it have been added but curl multi not added?
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe u tested the updater locally, with master branch?
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when 18.0.3 drops we'll see if it's broken xd
22:19 < bridge> <learath2> I mean it's a fact that the updater for 18.0 was broken
22:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but bcs of the includes
22:20 < bridge> <robyt3> Which one? The other bug was unrelated to curl-multi
22:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not bcs the client was replaced by the server üòÑ
22:20 < bridge> <robyt3> Most likely because the system.h includes were changed multiple times
22:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it's kinda funny thought. ppl randomly start server now xd
22:20 < bridge> <robyt3> And system.h included the necessary detect.h for the updater
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we had ODR issues before because detect.h was missed to be included
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's simply that c macros suck like we use them
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> too unsecure
22:21 < bridge> <learath2> OH, so someone else broke the updater not me
22:21 < bridge> <learath2> That's perfect
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> robyte refactor üò¨
22:22 < bridge> <learath2> I see where my confusion came from. The reports we got for the broken textures, I thought they were from the RC
22:22 < bridge> <learath2> they were from the nightly
22:23 < bridge> <robyt3> As always :greenthing: , 50% of the problems I fix are caused by me
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> blame the language
22:24 < bridge> <robyt3> This would not have happened if we applied this more strictly: https://include-what-you-use.org/
22:25 < bridge> <learath2> I was so close to finding a solution, but then C++ doesn't support `std::function<void(void)>` back to the drawing board
22:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the problem is that c macros probably don't trigger a "must include"
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since we handle the undefined path
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this wouldn't have happened if we'd use constexpr
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or had an #error in first place
22:33 < bridge> <robyt3> With C++20 there are also modules: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/modules
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh yeah
22:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hate header files
22:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> does that mean we are finally getting #6797 :o
22:34 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6797
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> not until deen can build ddnet with it
22:34 < bridge> <melo∆û> :pepeW: gg wp wait till 2025
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> probably yes
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the next ubuntu drops
22:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> god damn it XD
22:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> April 2025 is EOF for ubuntu 20
22:37 < bridge> <robyt3> Steam stopped supporting Windows 7 this year so we can probably stop supporting that as well
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chairn still uses it
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that kek
22:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd guess many people are still running win7
22:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> open issue to remove chairn then
22:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> idk
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we can certainly drop win7, even if ppl use it
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's end of life
22:37 < bridge> <robyt3> Anyone using Windows 7 can still upgrade to Windows 10 without issues
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we dont need to give more support than windows xD
22:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> end of life was 2020 wasnt it? XD
22:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Windows 7 shouldn't really be connected to the internet anymore unless you are really sure what you are doing
22:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I doubt it. talk to one of them
22:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Or you pay for extended support
22:38 < bridge> <reitw> well tbh it's eol, supporting people who can't make the move to install an operating system that still has updates is bad
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but why should we talk to them?
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> is that our duty?
22:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the software is considered dead. thats it
22:39 < bridge> <robyt3> I'd say Windows 10 is not harder on the hardware then Windows 7 so that's not the limit
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's simply bcs win10 has all these UWP settings nobody wanted xddd
22:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or whatever that UI is called
22:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> i rather have a little more bloat on my system, than a non supported OS that didnt receive any security updates in the past YEAR's
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1202367938158403624/image.png?ex=65cd3367&is=65babe67&hm=8b770132156d5c534a0642cb8ed6d428c310c0cced59aed57ca4f355188cb09e&
22:40 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah lol
22:41 < bridge> <reitw> + even with some motivation you can still remove that bloat
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it even says in the requirements
22:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> funny
22:41 < bridge> <melo∆û> thats cool ngl
22:42 < bridge> <robyt3> I don't know if it's even fair to say we "support" Windows Vista and 7 right now. Nothing is tested by us those Windows versions, it's just the lowest versions that are formally supported.
22:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is that so? would be surprised
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's probably even the opposite
22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> win7 aero is a killer
22:44 < bridge> <reitw> requirements for windows 10 are the same as win7
22:44 < bridge> <robyt3> According to the articles I find for "windows 7 system requirements compared to windows 10 requirements" they seem pretty much identical
22:44 < bridge> <robyt3> Because Windows 10 is just better software than Windows 7
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @heinrich5991 it's nice that u want every person to be happy, but keep in mind that you don't make our life,devs, happier with that.
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> supporting a dead system is a trade.
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if those ppl using win7 want to stick to the past, they can use an old ddnet client
22:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> i'm not sure it's such a good idea to try and support a system that has been declared dead for years and publicly labeled as unsafe - it's just holding us back in a lot of ways isn't it?
22:45 < bridge> <reitw> then fokkonaut will come with sevenup :KEKSad: (was a jk like 0.7 support)
22:45 < bridge> <robyt3> Windows 11 is a cursed version again though so I'll stay on Windows 10 as long as possible :pepeH:
22:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's the same that people said about win10 btw
22:46 < bridge> <reitw> win11 runs perfectly
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> every second windows sucks
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's the rule
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hate win11 taskbar too xdd
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so anti productive
22:46 < bridge> <reitw> why that, it's good
22:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> what do you mean, windows 8 was great! who doesnt want a desktop android phone
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> extra hovers/clicks
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> always bad
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> grouping = not seeing the label of the window
22:47 < bridge> <reitw> ah you mean the show more button
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean the always groupped feature
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that u cant disable without advanced registry tricks xD
22:47 < bridge> <reitw> only thing I hate with win11 is the "show more options" when you right click
22:47 < bridge> <robyt3> Windows 10 has definitely matured very well. If Windows 11 get's out what I consider its public beta until 2025 (Windows 10 EOL) then I'd likely upgrade, but in its current state I wouldn't
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> omg yeah
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that sucks even more
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> true
22:48 < bridge> <melo∆û> i gotta say, the jump from windows 10 to windows 11 was quite easy when i've done it, with my new PC on the way i'll most likely VM into windows 11 again, not windows 10
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> win11 requires dx12 a.k.a. vulkan support
22:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> based
22:49 < bridge> <reitw> tbh windows in general I keep it cuz of anticheats
22:49 < bridge> <reitw> sad
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i keep it to test ddnet stuff
22:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
22:49 < bridge> <melo∆û> vanguard? XD
22:50 < bridge> <learath2> My computer doesn't even support w11 üòÑ
22:50 < bridge> <reitw> Battleye
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> replace
22:50 < bridge> <learath2> not everyone extremely rich like you
22:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> meh, you can tweak it, ventoy is a great tool to do so (basically allow's installing windows 11 without TPM 2.0 and secure boot)
22:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> replace with your poorness
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i don't think that anyone in western society can't afford a new pc
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they cheap af
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they maybe dont want
22:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> me who just bought one for 2.5K‚Ç¨ lookin at your message :gigachad:
22:51 < bridge> <robyt3> And you can tweak your Windows install media so it automatically completes the installation by answering every spyware question with no and creating a local account instead of microsoft
22:51 < bridge> <reitw> valorant sux so
22:51 < bridge> <learath2> but then no vanguard üòÑ
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but then they'll get less software support. that's how it is
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
22:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> vanguard works fine, it just tweaks registry entry's afair reading
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> rich boi
22:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> it worked fine when i was doing it like that
22:52 < bridge> <learath2> I can afford a new pc, just not the one I want, why would I spend money on a sub par computer just to please you?
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> why please me
22:52 < bridge> <learath2> you are the one obsessed with making everyone get a new pc
22:52 < bridge> <melo∆û> league of legends uses vanguard aswell now
22:52 < bridge> <reitw> so that u can run cp like that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_toA8lErAHg
22:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so they don't fall behind
22:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> thats one of the reason's im gonna need to GPU breakthrough
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the future will come
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with or without them
22:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> cant even play league on linux anymore ;(
22:53 < bridge> <learath2> I'd rather not spend 2.5k to run windows11 an OS that I don't like
22:54 < bridge> <reitw> rip, I'm happy not to play those games, I hate them. Most of the games I play uses battleye (shit ac btw) like Escape From Tarkov
22:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> spend 2.5K to run teeworlds on linux with 12K fps
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what only 12k?
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> we have to talk
22:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> √§h
22:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> yes
22:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> as soon as my pc is here
22:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> you gonna help me set it up so it runs on 30K
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it should be atleast 16k
22:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else i'm really sad
22:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> i enjoy them with friends, which made me sad to not be able to play them anymore because league thought a kernel based anti cheat is the way to go
22:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> i enjoy them with friends, which made me sad to not be able to play them anymore because riot games thought a kernel based anti cheat is the way to go
22:55 < bridge> <reitw> how tf do u have 16k, I have only 2-3k
22:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> windows issue
22:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> i swear
22:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller has the current record with 17k
22:55 < bridge> <melo∆û> when i was running ddnet on windows, i had 900 fps max, 4K on linux
22:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> on 4090 and intel 13900k
22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
22:56 < bridge> <melo∆û> hmm, i might be able to beat it
22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> even on a gtx 760 i had like 5k fps
22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno wtf win is doing
22:56 < bridge> <reitw> damn maybe with the grow of eBPF, prob anticheats could make the move to linux awell
22:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it sucks xd
22:56 < bridge> <reitw> damn maybe with the grow of eBPF, prob anticheats could make the move to linux aswell
22:56 < bridge> <reitw> as eBPF is kinda available also on windows
22:56 < bridge> <reitw> eBPF is the key for everything :giga_chad:
22:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> meh, im just gonna GPU breakthrough to a windows VM, so i can game in peace, while not needing to dual boot
22:57 < bridge> <reitw> I mean having an eBPF based anticheat they could easily port it to linux aswell, so they allow linux users too
22:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for some reason i never played a game yet that wasnt compatible on linux
22:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> riot games absolutely wont move to linux, they rather support macOS with a playerbase of 0.1% than linux
22:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Typical ddnet influencer
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> lol works for me
22:58 < bridge> <teero777> Is there a difference between passthrough and "breakthrough"? Never heard that term
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> skill issue
22:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> newest league update included vanguard
22:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chiller is legend
22:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> so it wont run on linux
22:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> not a ddnet influencer, github influencer, that dude uses github like its reddit and instagram
22:58 < bridge> <teero777> tried bottles?
22:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> this guy read's library documentation's in his spare time
22:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> wine/bottles/proton
22:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> the problem lies within the way vanguard works
22:59 < bridge> <teero777> it's fun to see what other ppls projects look like :owo:
22:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> true!
22:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what can u even cheat with lol?
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> are the bots there already so advanced?
23:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> its all about preventing .dll and memory injections
23:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> idk
23:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I didn't find his credit card info there :+
23:00 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I didn't find his credit card info there üò¶
23:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> not...yet
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> like any anti cheat ever worked
23:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
23:00 < bridge> <teero777> xD
23:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> exactly :P
23:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> thats why i dont understand the fuss about it
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> bathtub almost full
23:01 < bridge> <reitw> @blaiszephyr <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKYOspIJiWE> sad cuz apparently on linux it has 3-5+fps
23:02 < bridge> <reitw> but wouldn't anticheat move their ass with the grow of consoles like the steam deck?
23:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> aight, gonna buy escape from tarkov on new pc
23:02 < bridge> <reitw> lmaoo, actually eft is the biggest game made with unity
23:03 < bridge> <reitw> well rip battleye afterall, I think they're doing kernel-level ac aswell
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> isn't unity already a reason to not play it
23:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
23:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk6aKV2rY7E
23:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
23:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> great dude
23:03 < bridge> <reitw> well no, EFT is amazing, devs did smth on an engine that is not even made for lmao
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i hate c# just as much as java
23:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> did you know teeworlds was supposed to be a game engine before it actually changed to be its own game?
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i must hate unity
23:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> soz
23:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:
23:04 < bridge> <reitw> yes ik, it was also a project presented at Ubisoft
23:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> oh my god yes i almost forgot that
23:04 < bridge> <reitw> but forgot what exactly happened
23:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> imagine teeworlds beeing a ubisoft game
23:04 < bridge> <reitw> :KEKSad:
23:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> shit would've been dead already
23:05 < bridge> <reitw> ice skin in a pack
23:05 < bridge> <reitw> xD
23:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> XD
23:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> get the santa_twinbop for just 4'99$ !!!!!!!!
23:09 < bridge> <melo∆û> alright, off to sleep i go, goodnight peeps, may rust be with you
23:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is it holding us back in many ways?
23:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> Well on each Update of Our dependencies and External libs, we are considering older Distributions aswell as older Windows Versionn, it seems counter effective to me
23:18 < bridge> <melo∆û> But then, i dont know a Lot about all that, maybe you want to be accessible to the Most amount of people, which i understand
23:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Every backward compatibility holds us back
23:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that seems pretty vague to me
23:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> basically something you could say about everything, nothing specific
23:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Using software must be just as much fun as coding it :brownbear:
23:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> You Guys have fun coding? Weirdos
23:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Depends on the software
23:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I have extremely fun making the dd-pg engine.
23:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I've zero fun adding vanilla and database support xd
23:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> yeah i suppose i agree with that, i cant really Put into words what i wanna say - i think the Former discussion about Windows 7 Support is Something that Made Me say that
23:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I drag these features out to infinity xdd
23:23 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> what dd-pg is gonna have tw physics/network compatibility why? wasn't the purpose to make something better?
23:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Only physics
23:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Database I mean trying to add support an interface so ddnet physics can be implemented
23:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ( and their SQL)
23:24 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hmm
23:25 < bridge> <chairn> rip me
23:25 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> why not use only the physics that were good/fast?
23:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Map loading will stay compatible in the first version too
23:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well there is actually no need to support any kind of physics
23:26 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah ig it makes sense to be able to load old maps and save them in a new format or smt
23:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I want to implement vanilla to test the interface a bit
23:26 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah makes sense ;)
23:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But u can basically create a complete different game as long as it implements the interface
23:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's basically the idea, yes
23:28 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :) ok seems I didn't missunderstood much then
23:30 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> do you also have in mind accounts or are you not there yet?
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I still have my original account plan for ddnet. But I'm very demotivated to implement all SQL changes
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think in the first version I'll not prioritize it , else I'll never get finished.
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Since it has quic support it at least has the ground to do it
23:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But one would also need to change all SQL and scripts for website
23:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And that sucks xd
23:35 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> hmm now I got confused again xD
23:35 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> you'd want to stay compatible with old ddnet in any way?
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Database and map
23:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Else no
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But to be fair. I'm not gonna implement ddnet
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'll try to convince @zwelf2 to switch to zlib license üòè
23:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
23:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD
23:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> His ddnet impl is far ahead
23:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> what does the database refer to?
23:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mysql or whatever we use
23:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :O is it foss or will it be later or is it closed?
23:37 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's agpl
23:38 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD I meant for what reason. for stats?
23:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> On gitlab
23:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> For ranks
23:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If u not interested basing your mod on top of ddnet ignore the db part
23:40 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah xD
23:40 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> >:) i'll do just that since I can
23:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah BTW,I lied. Map comparability is not a must have. It will only additionally have a converter. Your mod can implement whatever you want to a certain extend. At least that's the plan
23:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Compatibility
23:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah that what I meant too
23:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> one way compatibility from ddnet to dd-pg
23:41 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> else it'd be limiting imo
23:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In future yes. The first format could be two way
23:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's a superset
23:43 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD gitlab ui is either bad or I just seem to able to comprehend it (can't seem to find the repo)
23:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ddnet-rs
23:44 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> this <https://gitlab.com/ddnet-rs> ig?
23:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
23:44 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> :) maybe I need to watch a vid about how the gitlab ui works
23:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it seems cool (haven't look at the code yet (if I speak why I am in big trouble)) but ig it's more compatibility oriented which isn't my style
23:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yep. For ddnet it makes sense tho. Ddnet could ofc start a second season and break some physics
23:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> For vanilla based mods compatibility is probably not as interesting
23:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah that's why it's cool
23:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah that's why it's not my style
