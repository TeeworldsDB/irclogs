07:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @soulyvevo: amazing! Will you send pr or should I?
07:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I agree. It should write in public chat which admin moved who to where. Otherwise it can seem like a bug also for individuell moves
09:37 < bridge> <soulyvevo> i went to sleep lol
09:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sleepouly
09:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> milkeey

09:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> feature or bug?
10:11 < ws-client> <**ChillerDragon**> helo
10:13 < bridge> <milkeeycat> hallo

10:54 < ChillerDragon> bro it leaked my password=?!?!??!
10:54 < ChillerDragon> wtf xd

10:59 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao chiller
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
11:00 < ws-client> security incident!
11:00 < ws-client> axaxax i hacked u chiller
11:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmfao
11:00 < ChillerDragon> who are you
11:01 < ChillerDragon> get out of my account!
11:19 < ws-client> <**ChillerDragon**> do the bold names look better on dc?
11:22 < bridge> <kollpotato> perhaps make the angle brackets bold too
11:22 < bridge> <vahemaaa> yes
11:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ye? oke
11:25 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** owo
11:27 < bridge> <kollpotato> epic
11:28 < bridge> <kollpotato> now add an ability to login with a ddnet account
11:28 < ChillerDragon> what is a ddnet account
11:29 < bridge> <kollpotato> uh
11:30 < bridge> <vahemaaa> chillerdragon kral when you merge branch ddnet to chillerbot, doesnt some codes conflict, do you check them?
11:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** when editing the code i think about possibly conflicts to reduce the amount of conflicts in the future
11:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** but yes sometimes i get some and then i have to manually fix them ._.
11:41 < bridge> <vahemaaa> i understand thanks

14:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** found a win32 bit win xp ddnet 3 enjoyer xd
16:48 < bridge> <pilonpl> does the server even know which tee is active?
18:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> chiller why are you bot
18:35 < bridge> <kollpotato> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1396531084702777374/image.png?ex=687e6c6c&is=687d1aec&hm=e9f00413651af94643c16eadbf7c4ff1ef2d917a82e47cc53d26a7b05549d32d&
18:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> because he loves bans :banhammer:
18:55 < bridge> <melon> @pioooooo why do you prefer c-style casts over a static_cast?
18:55 < bridge> <melon> 
18:55 < bridge> <melon> static_casts are typesafe and much easier to read and understand than c_style casts imo
18:55 < bridge> <melon> they're generally unclear in their intention aswell
19:17 < bridge> <robyt3> I assume it's only about the `auto` and they want `auto *pPlayerInput = static_cast<CNetObj_PlayerInput *>(pInput);` instead
19:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I wouldn't mine static casts if it wouldn't be annoying to type them.. e.g. if clang-tidy would simply auto rewrite them, or the IDE does it automatically or smth
19:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> I wouldn't mind static casts if it wouldn't be annoying to type them.. e.g. if clang-tidy would simply auto rewrite them, or the IDE does it automatically or smth
19:19 < bridge> <robyt3> C-style cast should generally be avoided because they perform several different things implicitly, some of which you should almost never do, like `const_cast`
19:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Simply disallow them by compiler flag
19:20 < bridge> <robyt3> `static_cast<int>(...)` I don't really like this though
19:30 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @kollpotato no proof
19:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** @pilonpl the server does not know it. If you want to know it make sure to like share and subscribe my issue about it https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9515
19:31 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** for your broadcast issue you could just send it to both tees should be fine
19:32 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** better than the possible race condition of trying to time the active tee even if it is known because switching can be instant but sending a network message is not
19:32 < bridge> <pilonpl> yeah
19:32 < bridge> <pilonpl> so we do know which tees are from the same client?
19:33 < bridge> <pilonpl> also i wonder if there is ever a case in which you want to only send the message to one tee
19:33 < bridge> <pilonpl> but i guess not
19:34 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Lol chiller is bold now
19:37 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** yea i even leaked my irc password while deploying bold feature
19:38 < bridge> <pilonpl> i think it looks better
19:44 < bridge> <melon> Don't worry I deleted it
19:44 < bridge> <melon> I'll however, still hack you
19:44 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** ye someone requested it here i forgot who ._.
19:50 < bridge> <pilonpl> or maybe we rely on the ip address?
19:53 < bridge> <melon> The IP can give it away, but there is no way to know that. It could very well just be 2 friends playing from the same network
19:53 < bridge> <pilonpl> yeah that's why it's not a good solution
19:54 < bridge> <melon> The only actual reliable thing is the naming at this point
19:54 < bridge> <melon> 
19:54 < bridge> <melon> - Name(1)
19:54 < bridge> <melon> - [D] Name
19:54 < bridge> <melon> - Name.
19:56 < bridge> <pioooooo> Yeah I only meant the `auto` like what robyte said
19:57 < bridge> <melon> Aaah, idk I personally like being explicit
19:57 < bridge> <melon> Having to read the entire line to know the type
19:57 < bridge> <pioooooo> I just prefer less duplicate types
19:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> maybe this thing actually?
19:58 < bridge> <pilonpl> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1396551751926153408/image.png?ex=687e7fac&is=687d2e2c&hm=ade6451e7943f0faafe5dcfd07b098af5f5c8e3058fb1c191b9bec7eb88a8679&
19:58 < bridge> <melon> I do like auto for super complex types, I use it fairly regular myself but it's just to make my life easier
19:58 < bridge> <pioooooo> Just preferences
19:58 < bridge> <melon> Ye
19:58 < bridge> <melon> Uuid reads so wrong
20:15 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** just delete broadcast_id and add broadcast_ip ez
20:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: do you not want to debug rust code by any chance? xd
20:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** no
20:17 < ws-client> **<ChillerDragon>** go merge c code
20:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i need to fix rust code first
20:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> or maybe do it on the client side? idk might be impossible too
20:19 < bridge> <pilonpl> and not backwards compatible i guess
21:29 < bridge> <pilonpl> Wow
21:29 < bridge> <pilonpl> So the fix was actually really simple
21:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> And client sided
21:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> But it won't work for older clients
21:30 < bridge> <pilonpl> Is that an issue?
21:48 < bridge> <kebscs> you cant fix it for older clients bcs server doesnt know about dummy
21:52 < bridge> <Ewan> disappointed but unsurprised to read that macOS SSH has supported SRV records for DNS-based non-default port mapping, but OpenSSH still to this day does not
21:52 < bridge> <Ewan> disappointed but unsurprised to read that macOS SSH has supported SRV records for DNS-based non-default port mapping since at least 2008, but OpenSSH still to this day does not
21:53 < bridge> <learath2> I applied to like 10 jobs today, lets see how many even give me a reply ðŸ˜„
