03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Smetanolub> i wanted to ask u for adding new thing to cliennt
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then click the green "New issue" button in the top right on this page next time: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki where did you get the discord mac libraries? I downloaded it from the link you wrote in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-libs/pull/16/files but it seems to be Windows only
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, actually there is a dylib, ok
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But I guess I need to build it myself for arm support
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah ye its provided by discord
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if there is for arm
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/discussions/3229
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, maybe I should measure how much slower we are with rosetta
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> to see if it's worth switching to native arm without discord sdk
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I hate companies
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the sdk contains some source code, is that the full source code of the sdk maybe?
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if so, we could build it ourselves, but i didn'T check
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I've got osxcross to build for arm64 ðŸ™‚
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, apparently not
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 any idea what the best approach would be for the unified binary on macOS? How can I use cmake to build for two architectures? Afterwards I can just put it together with lipo
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We only had this kind of setup with bam before, there it was pretty easy to just add additional targets
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe it would be cleanest to have two build directories and then run a script afterwards to put together the dmg from them?
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://discord.com/open-source
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Discord is committed to the principles of open source development: that we all succeed when we work together as engineers and share our solutions. Here are some of our open source contributions.
19:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and they ban third-party clients
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/OSX_ARCHITECTURES.html#prop_tgt:OSX_ARCHITECTURES
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> seems like cmake has native support for generating universal binaries
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure if you want to wrangle with cmake. I can't do it, I don't have a mac
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because that one is a threat to their monopoly ðŸ˜„
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wats a  universal binaries
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is the point of owning a business if you can't completely dominate the market?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> contains code for different cpu architectures
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There was a fat elf proposal but it never made it iirc, so I'm only aware of machO doing fat binaries
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ’€
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hahaha
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> >  I checked this repo for a 30min, and it does not make any sense to me.
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Only god himself knows how that website completely works
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aka deen
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sorry for the spaghetti code
