01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did it always let go of keys when you stop chatting?
02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <! é√∏1√∏ ûƒ±∆ùg> @Learath2 Not if u used f1
07:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Also works without F1 by simply holding and starting to chat
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 It's only on DDNet servers
07:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> deen once said its intended after a fix by me
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> @fokkonaut send the message and it will let go of any key held down
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ik
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah i misunderstood the message
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it was early in the morning xD

13:07 <+ChillerDragon> xd
14:29 <+ChillerDragon> yo bois i just finished the alpha of my sloppy map diff tool. If one needs a ascii diff preview of two map files and doesnt mind running super slow bash scripts i have the tool :D
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Wait, all in bash? or is it using some tw map lib?
14:52 <+ChillerDragon> no not all in bash :D its just a parser for a exisiting git diff
14:52 <+ChillerDragon> so you have to create a mapdir directory using edit_map from Patigas rust twmap tools
14:55 <+ChillerDragon> i made it to audit map pullrequests. So if Forris comes around with another ddnet map "bugfix" you can see where on the map he added some new teleporters :D
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Can those rust tools convert maps to text and back?
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> That would be cool
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> could even merge maps
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> could even git merge maps
15:06 <+ChillerDragon> yes
15:06 <+ChillerDragon> @timakro https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap
15:07 <+ChillerDragon> i would convert my github maps repo to json format but i cant git push because 1 layer exceeds githubs max file size
15:39 <+ChillerDragon> thats how a smol sample map looks like https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1612795123.png
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Nice!
15:49 <+ChillerDragon> yea Patiga's tool is awesome it works so good and fast to convert maps to a directory of json files. It can be used to detect map bugs and spot unwanted changes. Finally more control over those myterious binary blobs.
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> When slapped into a git dir you can get these diffs from vanilla edit_map tool https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1612795663.png
15:50 <+ChillerDragon> and my script then parses the git diff and trys to draw a preview map. Which is mostly just a indecator where in the map changes where made since map sizes are usually bigger than your terminal window so it has to scale down and thus loses detail.
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BRONOOB> Sorry, I saw that the 60000up card was published, but I can't find it on the list.
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BRONOOB> Sorry, I saw that the 60000up map was published, but I can't find it on the list.
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Its on decline
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BRONOOB> More?
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> #‚ùåüéâ60000up declined, even fun maps need to have some effort put into them
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> a 60,000 block fall isn't going to be released
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BRONOOB> I think this is interesting. Shoot the grenade at certain angles to achieve the result faster. Okay.
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ya its interesting but its not for ddnet
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BRONOOB> It's hard to figure out what is needed. There are fun server cards that can be called "no sense" anymore.
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BRONOOB> It's hard to figure out what is needed. There are fun server maps that can be called "no sense" anymore.
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> they were released long ago
17:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> regardless, anyone can make a 60,000 block fall so we don't release things like that
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BRONOOB> Wouldn't say any. Understood you
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://foundation.rust-lang.org/posts/2021-02-08-hello-world/
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 ^
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon have you considered parsing the diff and making the diff into a teeworlds map?
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @timakro @ChillerDragon note that the tool currently incorrectly parses quads. @174 noticed in that i did a mistake in the docs and that is also in the tool currently, fix is on the way
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> *noticed, that
23:07 <+ChillerDragon> @Learath2 no havent thought about it but now that you mention it. It could be feed into libtw2 maprender and then have a image preview of changes.
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep that‚Äôs what I had in mind
