13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @deen  can you add a ddnet.tw activity graph to statistics? would really like to see hopw much it declined
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Activity ?
16:55 <+Bzhu> Ehm, no, I only just entered.
16:56 <+Bzhu> But I intend to ask questions only in about 1h, maybe more
18:52 <@heinrich5991> that "Activity ?" message was referring to an earlier message ^^
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Yeah, the corneum message indeed xd
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> because forum lost a lot of traffic and i just wonder how much. i remember 2 pages on "new posts" like 2 years ago, and now there arfe 3 topics at best
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum i don't keep logs that long
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I can't, sorry
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I think we only have 2 weeks of web logs
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Forum mostly moved to discord
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> DDNet.tw visitors appear pretty stable though, 1500-2000 / day, but that includes bots, client has 1700 - 2400 unique ips / day for comparison
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> And we're much more stable now, so not much to discuss or look up I guess
