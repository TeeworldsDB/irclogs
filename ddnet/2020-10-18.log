00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if it can output invalid buffers and draw calls yes
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just want to see what kind of output I can get out of it, not sure if it'll be helpful at all
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if its something different to invalid operations or smth yes
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wtf
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> was glew_static removed
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hi
00:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how do i disable antibot on lan
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> by not connecting bot
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In good news all our shaders are completely valid
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in bad news I spent an hour trying to preprocess them in every configuration and write a script to get them out of tw
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thank you for doing that
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 are ghost files easier to create from teehistorian than demos btw?
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen you could create limited ghost files in the same way as teehistorian2demo creates limited demos
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ghost files also contain velocity, and hook position in addition to current position
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Hm, too bad. So need the full server to recreate ghost too
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it was the intention to require the full server
01:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to save less info
01:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, surprisingly only 2 finishes on versions with broken solo
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> good thing I didn't nuke every solo/race run from today
01:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> did you see the teamrank by N9?
01:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @louis lol wdym
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> he wants kclient on lan server
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> the sv_ban_kclient option wasnt showing up in console
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> does he want many tees
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> @louis just download the newest botless version of kclient, its not detected by that check and u can still use the 64 tees
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no botless doesnt work either
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i might have an outdated kclient but there should be a way to disable anticheat on lan
01:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> u do have outdated then
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cus it should work
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> sv setting would be nice tho
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i guess
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so i can test my fng bots
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> :troll:
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ...
01:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ban nouis
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Meh, no way to really know which version a save originated on, so all solo and race saves from today have been deleted
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I think you asked earlier where DDNet stuff is built
02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where was it?
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddnet.tw?
02:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ddnet.tw
02:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > A bug affecting mostly solo and race servers was noticed earlier today. Only records abusing the bug have been deleted. Since there is no way to know which version a save was created on all saves created today on race and solo were deleted.
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 contradiction: only records abusing the bug have been deleted <-> all race and solo records were deleted
02:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> All race and solo saves were deleted
02:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Records are there unless they were played on a broken revision
02:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so remove "Only records abusing the bug have been deleted."?
02:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I didn't only delete saves, I also deleted ranks
02:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I deleted all saves, I didn't delete all ranks
02:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
02:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> aah
02:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see
02:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did I word that badly?
02:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I didn't see that you were talking about saves
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 did the teehistorian git revision for the server work?
02:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Any reason it shouldn't work?
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I extracted it from the json header of the teehistorian file
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because someone (I thought you) said they were broken
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oooh
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ooooooooh I didn't think of that
02:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah the SHA was fine
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but?
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> only the version was broken
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because of caching
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hum
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how does that work?
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we don't generate the version I think?
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I fixed it with #3123
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3123
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 We kinda sorta do now
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Tell me about the bug
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We parse version.h then we redefine `GAME_RELEASE_VERSION`
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> okay, that's backwards
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 😄
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ᶰ°Konͧsti a pull request made some commands only available inside map configs e.g. `sv_solo_server` but when merging we forgot that we use some of these in our resetfiles not in map configs
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I wanted to instead generate version.h entirely, but I got sidetracked validating the shader code with glslang
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> so maps that didnt have sv solo server in settings were able with dummy?
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ᶰ°Konͧsti yep
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 we should decide on either doing it from cmake or from source
02:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but most servers hadn't updated yet
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 we need to be able to override it on the command-line, so it should probably be in cmake
02:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd prefer source, so we can still compile ddnet with `g++ **.cpp **.c (pkg-config libs)`
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> xd
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but you can do command line as well
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we also need to generate source
02:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> i remember /map Bumba, vote solo server, do /map Bumba and then chose any solomap to finish with dummy
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is `configure_file(src/game/version.h vd.h)`
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a workaround for cmake 2.8 which we claim to support
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> When make server tunes able for zones
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Like disable hammer or collision
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you tried compiling it on cmake 2.8?
02:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it just copies version.h to vd.h and thus creates a dependence
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> honestly, I couldn't be assed to download ancient cmake 😛
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's not tested doesn't work anyway
02:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. I doubt it worked on cmake 2.8 before your change
02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be nice if you could clean up the version stuff
02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we only need a way to suffix our releases
02:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> > When make server tunes able for zones
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ᶰ°Konͧsti aren't all tunes available in tunezones?
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> no
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Hammer off isnt available for tune zones
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder what that breaks which made us disable some tunes
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Only whole map
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> its not disabled
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not a tune
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think
02:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Just not possible
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That would explain it
02:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ᶰ°Konͧsti yeah there is no hammer off tune 😄
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> but a server setting
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> and if u want it off for a specific zone only u still have to use spam tiles
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> u can set strenght to 0
02:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> But it would still unfreeze
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Collislion zone also doesnt exist i think
02:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm off, can't learn vocabulary like that, I'm constantly distracting myself with discord 😄
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> good night 🙂
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 what vocabulary?
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you know it 😉
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, gl
02:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Gn8 Heinreich
02:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ᶰ°Konͧsti can't make server settings behave like that sadly
02:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> cant just create a tune zone for it? xd
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One could maaybe code something like a "config zone" but it'd break a whole lot of things and waste a TON of memory
02:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe more tunes can be added
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> > Maybe more tunes can be added
02:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @Learath2 thats what i mean
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mind boggling
03:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Did you change tee collisions or deep fly somehow?
03:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> or hammer logic
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> About those weird crashes on Windows, i made this thing:
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> https://github.com/ccomrade/c1-launcher/blob/master/Code/Launcher/CrashLogger.cpp
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> It catches all unhandled fatal SEH exceptions within the process and logs stacktrace and few other things. No external tools or libraries are needed. It uses just basic WinAPI. The code is not so nice because it works with WinAPI and it also needs to be compatible with VS2005 compiler that has no C++11 support. To obtain nice stacktraces with source file names and line numbers, you need to provide symbol files (.pdb) next to your EXEs/DLLs.
10:14 <+ChillerDragon> omg new ddnet servers messes with my skin how can i opt out @heinrich5991 ?
10:15 <+ChillerDragon> wait is it forced?
10:15 <+ChillerDragon> should be ``events 1`` imo
10:16 <+ChillerDragon> guess its time to downgrade the server :/
10:16 <+ChillerDragon> oh sorry heinrich looks like @deen is to blame
10:16 <+ChillerDragon> sorry for the spam im lil pissed xd
10:24 <+ChillerDragon> oh btw @deen the demo that recorded the kill feed bug does not exist. Probably another bug that kills autorecording on timeout protection.
10:25 <+ChillerDragon> i rly dont understand the halloween code and how to turn it off neither events 1 nor events 0 helps
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: halloween only gets set to true when events 1 is set
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> i fixed it in a pr @deen
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> u were only showing halloween skins when halloween is not set
10:49 <+ChillerDragon> i guess uv seen it xd
10:50 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i can get a thsirt after all this yr :D
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> meh can u guys even tell a difference? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1603012286.png
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> Hey, i'm back
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wb
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> @ChillerDragon delete IRC when
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, left is vector, right is old
12:03 <+ChillerDragon> correct deen but still
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> a seemingly empty name on ger1 :8298
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ㅤ:
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> @redix what's your github again? You made the F-client for 0,7, right?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> Nope. It's from @fokkonaut
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> f-client by fallenKN :troll:
16:41 <+ChillerDragon> @onbgy
16:42 <+ChillerDragon> @trml here?
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no u
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen i think server commands that return a time should also use hours
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in accordance with the client
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/767406151977402378/unknown.png
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think only mapinfo is the one left out
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/767412144026157076/unknown.png
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> demos don't do it as well
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We have to be careful with the format for "finished in: ". It's parsed by the client
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'll fix the "Finish time:"
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should probably add a warning comment for the "finished in" string
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> will do
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why does the client need to parse that?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for demos and ghost names
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then we can hack the client
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and display it with hours
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> after parsing
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nono
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i think there's a finish time packet already, use that in the client
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and then wait a few months and you can change the format in server
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we will have to remember
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can add a static_assert that checks the system time and once some date passed fails the compilation with an error message that reminds you
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 😄
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (not a serious suggestion)
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Amazing idea
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> a.k.a. how to make package managers hate you
18:44 <+ChillerDragon> what do you guys think of some way to make it easier to maintain a custom ddnet client? Like a api. Functions to hook in a plugin system or even some lua thingy like ath has. Something where one can modify the ddnet client without touching the source so hard that there is a merge conflict every month.
18:45 <+ChillerDragon> i played some minecraft these days and its awesome how users can combine client mods as easy as drag and dropping them into a mods/ folder. Would be fun for ddnet imo.
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not really fun how bad minecraft performs tho
18:45 <+ChillerDragon> haha yes its the worst
18:46 <+ChillerDragon> i never looked into ath but maybe their system is not too bad 
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> a clean code base would be nicer, than spamming stuff with more and more plugin systems
18:46 <+ChillerDragon> do we have a system already?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
18:46 <+ChillerDragon> or is more and more a hyperbel of 1?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the plugin system would be required to maintained just as the code, so it would break stuff here and there too i guess.. the code isnt ready for this in a bigger style
18:48 <+ChillerDragon> hm
18:48 <+ChillerDragon> there is a way to provide a antibot lib already hm?
18:48 <+ChillerDragon> that is something similar isnt it
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well i dunno what u need but ofc its doable, as said it just needs cleanup
18:49 <+ChillerDragon> what is dirty atm?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> adding hooks everywhere is dirty
18:50 <+ChillerDragon> hm
18:50 <+ChillerDragon> so any ideas how to do it nice?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> allow more polymorphism with better structures code
18:50 <+ChillerDragon> yikes
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> allow more polymorphism with better structure code
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> allow more polymorphism with better structured code
18:50 <+ChillerDragon> arent there nice hook loops already for all the components
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh? you cannot overload them can you?
18:51 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L320
18:52 <+ChillerDragon> just add an api component
18:52 <+ChillerDragon> or something like that
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u just want to add a component?
18:52 <+ChillerDragon> im nub im just spitting out ideas
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how does lead to merge conflicts
18:52 <+ChillerDragon> what do you mean?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> add your component somewhere.. finished
18:52 <+ChillerDragon> oh no i did never add a component everytime i changed something i did it directly in place
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then u have all access to the component interface
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Polymorphism is costly with how shitty compilers are at devirtualization
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://steamcommunity.com/app/412220/discussions/0/5118863332777631303/
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> all 3 people have 1 in common, they are all russian
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually had an interesting project for a while. I stole the idea from unreal engine. You tag the function with a macro and the preprocessor generates pre and post hooks for it
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I've reported a similar issue few days ago
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 sounds interesting xd
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://discordapp.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/766319349232435200
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @murpi best is you ask @deen to silence that warning again, it might be too aggressive
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> :PeepoShrug:
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi would be great to see a log when it happens next. Also there is #3080
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3080
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It does look very worrying for a quite recoverable error :D
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> how do print log's though?
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe they just blocked by ddnet.tw?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> how do get log's though?
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or vice versa
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @murpi you can either have your console on, or you can add `logfile client.log` to your config
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> where do you find the said log?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think deen said it appears in the config directory, but I have absolutely no idea tbh with you
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Polymorphism is costly with how shitty compilers are at devirtualization
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is llvm shit at that?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> for me it says it's in C: but it's not
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> hm okey
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki llvm is currently the best, though idk if the improvements landed in stable yet
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i kinda like a lot the idea of llvm
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but polymorphism is clean and still fast, its just an additional pointer loaded
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gcc has made progress too but theirs is just too agressive for now to be enabled
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> from vtable
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ yeah but it is a cost to be kept in mind and imho avoided if possible
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> RTTI isn't too pretty either
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is it wise to compile cmake stuff with clang instead of gcc?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++ :monkalaugh:
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I do both before pushing nowadays.
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rly want to use clang only
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> better error reporting
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> gcc is still a bit faster probs, but they got closer
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm much more excited about lld
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (the executable)
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If lld finally becomes stable we can finally ditch the old binutils
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > LLD is a linker from the LLVM project that is a drop-in replacement for system linkers and runs much faster than them.
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use rust tools + llvm utils
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ez
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> LLD is quite slow yet, maybe in theory its faster xD
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats the first sentence at their web tho
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://lld.llvm.org/
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > LLD is very fast. When you link a large program on a multicore machine, you can expect that LLD runs more than twice as fast as the GNU gold linker. Your mileage may vary, though.
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ maybe at multicore is better
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ✪ you sure? I remember the chromium team reporting it was much better
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, i used it a few times, and linking was slower
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw it says gold linker
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> apparently a thing used for rly big programs
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead of ld
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Gnu gold is also nice
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > You can embed LLD in your program to eliminate dependencies on external linkers
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Link-time optimization (LTO) is supported by default.
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ ur lto
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also lld, clang, llvm have such pretty codebases
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/767436471334207548/unknown.png
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is their test
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you ever read gcc's source, its actually painful
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like you want to die amounts of painful
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ r u sure ld is faster?
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/767436675516334130/unknown.png
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when i used it was defs slower
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when did u use it
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It might have been back when you tried it. It's got a lot of improvements over the last 3-4 years
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2010?
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but i dont compile huge programs like a compiler
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no like 2-3 months ago
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :tee_thinking:
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and im at clang 12 xd
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You sure you didnt misconfigure it or sth? :D
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> don't think so
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> only thing i could imagine is as said, the size of the project
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i only see claims being lld faster
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never saw any benchmarks with smaller projects tho, maybe there is some overhead thats much more obvious when its slower
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Smaller*
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki just tell me a project where u tested both and i test too 😄
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can i test it with ddnet
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> you can
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how to change the linker xd
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> -fuse-ld=lld
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt there a envar
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ` -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=lld` directly into cmake?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not really aware of the llvm cmake stuff
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just add to cpp flags
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet e88a7dee0
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hm
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but how do i time link time specifically
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just do it in CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> CXX=clang++ CC=clang CXXFLAGS='-fuse-ld=gold' CFLAGS='-fuse-ld=gold' cmake .. -GNinja
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> CXX=clang++ CC=clang CXXFLAGS='-fuse-ld=gold' CFLAGS='-fuse-ld=gold' time ninja
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well also LDFLAGS
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh shit i used gold
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
19:29 <+ChillerDragon> weird i can not reproduce the ping crash on debian+gnome
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh its gold
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mconfused
19:29 <+ChillerDragon> anyone using arch+gnome here? or any distro w a uptodate gnome version?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> didnt have lld installed xd
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It would be nice if we could get a `-DDEBUG_ASAN` to enable Asan easily

19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why is it using this
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> argument unused during compilation: '-fuse-ld=lld' [-Wunused-command-line-argument]
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You probably need to clean up your build dir
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i do xd
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt recognice lld
19:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as an argument

23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki was there anything itneresting in logs?
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh idk
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont save the logs :/
