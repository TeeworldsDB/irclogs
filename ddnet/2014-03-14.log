22:12 < Yensu> Me again, from a while back
22:12 < Yensu> I was playing with some of the game entities and somehow turned off multiplayer permanently it seems, can't find a command to put in the config file for it
22:13 < Yensu> I've restarted my server, that did no good
22:14 < Yensu> Might have fixed it.. no Idea what I did though
22:22 < Yensu> fixed it, don't know what I did
