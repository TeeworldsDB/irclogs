14:43 <@deen> I've seen the solution of my bachelor thesis mentor and one of my students on the TUM Haskell contest site^^
14:43 < o_be_one> deen, no idea, i've played on US. But i'll see more this night i think
14:44 < o_be_one> lol i was surprised about some tees more friendly with me since the news (apearing on motd last news). CAN tees are very enthusiastic
14:45 <@deen> =)
14:47 < BeaR> ^^
14:52 < o_be_one> lol someone asked me if i was "Maple" >.<
14:53 < BeaR> deen: I love the unsafeCoerce solution hahah

16:23 <@deen> hi bor
16:23 < bor> hi
16:23 < cris272> eclip
16:23 < cris272> ops
16:25 < cris272> i forgot ctr+f
16:25 < cris272> deen, i think the eclipse map should be more difficult
16:25 < cris272> i mean the notation
16:26 <@deen> cris272: yes, server and stars?
16:26 < cris272> hum, just start, maybe 4 or 5 stars on moderate
16:26 <@deen> ok
16:27 < cris272> there is easy part and 3/4 hard parts
16:32 <@deen> alright
17:51 < Nimda> DDNet South Africa went back online!
18:05 < Maple> sup
18:06 <@deen> hi Maple 
18:06 <@deen> Maple: any luck with recruiting Canadian players yet?
18:06 < Maple> couldnt find any lol
18:07 < Maple> oddly some south american players played there
18:07 < Maple> basically no one in canada plays teeworlds
18:17 <@deen> ^^
18:17 <@deen> Maple: yeah, you have to get them to play
18:18 < laxadedi> lol
18:20 < Maple> theyre too occupied sniffing maple syrup
19:16 < Nimda> Day 'n' Night by Rapture & ħίɴɖU just released on Brutal at 2014-11-13 19:11
20:49 < o_be_one> Rapture loves Kid Kuddi :D
20:54 < eeeee> you have to make ddnet client more noob-friendly to get new players
20:55 < eeeee> e.g. make a tutorial map (ideally with some scripts) and filter by that map by default in the server browser
20:58 <@deen> eeeee: yes, that's a good idea
20:59 <@deen> and i've always wanted a tutorial map for people to start playing ddrace, but no one wants to map one
20:59 <@deen> the mappers find it boring to map something for Novice 1 star
21:01 < eeeee> yeah but as i said ideally it should also be more dynamic. like you have to spawn a dummy in freeze and tell the noob to help him, so that the core concept of helping others sticks
21:01 < o_be_one> good idea
21:03 < eeeee> tutorial would be step-by-step clearing of objectives like that
21:04 < eeeee> ui for that could be built with envelopes and a bit of hacking with race time so that it's still compatible with vanilla
21:04 < eeeee> but serverside you'd need some additional code for scripting :/

23:21 <@deen> xrothx: more reports about bad ping from Deutsche Telekom recently
23:22 <@deen> and hi
23:37 < xrothx> I heard
23:38 < xrothx> notting I can do about it
23:38 < xrothx> unless you tell me what I can do ^^
23:40 <@deen> Maybe we should get another server
23:40 <@deen> but getting good ddos protection is so hard
23:41 <@deen> I see these possibilities:
23:41 <@deen> http://www.g-portal.de/rootserver/intel-x-mas/
23:41 <@deen> http://gametekk.de/vserver-details
23:41 <@deen> https://gc-server.de/v2/Cloud/
23:41 <@deen> but they're all weird companies i wouldn't want to deal with
23:42 < xrothx> 1st has 149€ setup, so will be nop
23:42 <@deen> yeah, exactly my thought
23:43 <@deen> in case "nop" means "nope" and not "no problem"
23:43 < xrothx> np = no problem for me ^^
23:43 < xrothx> 2nd one seems good actually
23:43 < xrothx> only some high costs 21€ for 4cpu.. 
23:44 <@deen> yes, it seems good, it's hosted at g-portal, has good ddos protection
23:44 <@deen> but getting out of the contract is difficult, the company only exists for about 1 year and the guy running it is about 18 and doesn't know much about hosting
23:44 < xrothx> Okay
23:44 < xrothx> So will be difficult
23:45 <@deen> maybe i should just get a 5 € server at gametekk to test how it runs
23:46 < xrothx> Its how you like
23:46 < xrothx> nfo is good though 
23:47 < xrothx> And not many ddos attempts anymore 
23:47 < xrothx> due to the high protection
23:48 <@deen> yeah, that's exactly why i'm hesitant
23:48 <@deen> i can't really tell how many players are affected
23:49 < xrothx> Make an ingame welcome_msg to ask who wants another root? 
23:49 < xrothx> or -> ask who want to keep this server
23:49 <@deen> well, they don't know yet how the other server would run for them
23:51 < eeeee> does the server know the ping, or it's computed only in client?
23:51 <@deen> anyway, let's just keep it as it is now
23:51 < eeeee> straighforward way to evaluate a server would be logging all the pings
23:52 <@deen> eeeee: ping is the result of the time between a server's SNAP msg and the server receiving the client's INPUT msg
23:52 <@deen> so the server computes it, but client can fake it by pretending to have a more recent snap already
23:54 < eeeee> i see, so it seems you can just log rtts
23:54 <@deen> we could do that. then how do we evaluate it?
23:54 <@deen> if tomorrow more people from russia happen to play ping of the server would seem higher
23:55 < eeeee> ping being a bit higher is not a big deal in ddrace as in understand
23:55 < eeeee> the real trouble starts when you have high jitter
23:55 < xrothx> not for a bit higher
23:55 < xrothx> but 150+ can be problematic 
23:56 < eeeee> yeah so i'd suggest e.g. dumping mean, stddev, and some precentiles like 0.90 0.95 0.99 for each client each minute
23:57 < eeeee> together with client ips
23:57 <@deen> players don't even like having a bit higher ping
23:57 <@deen> 20 -> 40 is bad for many pros
23:58 <@deen> 40 -> 20 as well btw, any ping changes
23:58 < eeeee> hmm
23:58 <@deen> would be interesting to group pings by subnet
23:58 <@deen> so you can see when Deutsche Telekom or another ISP is affected
