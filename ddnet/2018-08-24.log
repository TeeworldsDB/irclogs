09:18 <@deen> https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=153504937925732&w=2
09:18 <@deen> But I guess with our cheap shared hosters we're out of luck anyway
09:19 <+Ryozuki> deen u saw that yesterday night server ignored front layer on a brutal map?
09:20 <+Ryozuki> well idk if it was only front layer
09:20 <@deen> well that's weird
09:20 <@deen> ip, port, time?
09:21 <+Ryozuki> 01:00
09:21 <+Ryozuki> mmm i dont remember port, we were on quintessenz
09:21 <+Ryozuki> GER
09:21 <@deen> not on ddnet?
09:21 <+Ryozuki> on ddnet
09:21 <@deen> ah, quintessenz is a map, not a server :D
09:21 <+Ryozuki> only hook freeze unhook and ht worked
09:21 <@deen> I see a few servers segfaulted
09:22 <+Ryozuki> u can scroll on discord #general and u will see people complaining about it
09:22 <@deen> Some guys were trying to exploit something?
09:23 <+Ryozuki> no one
09:23 <+Ryozuki> it just didnt work
09:23 <@deen> Shawn and Spyker ran that map on LOTS of servers
09:23 <+Ryozuki> spyker is the one who reported it first
09:23 <@deen> were you on the server?
09:23 <+Ryozuki> i joined after he reported it to quintessenz
09:24 <+Ryozuki> and checked it
09:24 <+Ryozuki> he was on a oldschool sv
09:24 <+Ryozuki> playing lichking
09:24 <+Ryozuki> i think
09:25 <+Ryozuki> omg
09:25 <+Ryozuki> i think it still doesnt work
09:25 <+Ryozuki> join barren
09:25 <@deen> can't
09:25 <+Ryozuki> hammer off doesnt work
09:25 <+Ryozuki> i think people cheating this map right now xD
09:25 <@deen> ouch, so it's the same locally?
09:25 <@deen> not some sporadic problem?
09:25 <+Ryozuki> what you mean by locally?
09:26 <+Ryozuki> maybe its the 11.4 update?
09:26 <@deen> yeah, that's my guess
09:26 <@deen> just looking through the changes to figure out which one
09:27 <+Ryozuki> ger :8318 seems fine
09:27 <+Ryozuki> ger :8312
09:27 <+Ryozuki> not
09:28 <+Ryozuki> (i only know on the first solo works, on the second hammer off doesnt)
09:29 <+Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/482451186448990238/unknown.png i mean this should put ur hammer off right?
09:29 <@deen> can't open that png

09:30 <@deen> i guess
09:30 <+Ryozuki> i think its just 1 server affected
09:31 <@deen> so I kill 8312
09:32 <+Ryozuki> it still isnt fixed
09:32 <+Ryozuki> http://prntscr.com/kmbm82 can see and touch my partner
09:33 <@deen> is there a message about the tile?
09:33 <@deen> or it has no effect at all?
09:33 <+Ryozuki> no message
09:34 <@deen> I can reproduce it locally
09:34 <@deen> so all servers broken, some may just not have restarted yet after tonight's update
09:34 <+Ryozuki> i guess
09:34 <+Ryozuki> 11.3 works fine?
09:34 <+Ryozuki> or 11.4.1
09:35 <+Ryozuki> do 11.4 has the stopper thing?
09:35 <+Ryozuki> maybe its that?
09:35 <+Ryozuki> you reverted it on 11.4.1
09:35 <+Ryozuki> but servers use 11.4
09:37 <@deen> got it
09:37 <+Ryozuki> :o what is it

09:39 <@deen> it was the only suspicious code touching tile handling
09:39 <@deen> don't know where it went wrong exactly and heinrich will not be online soon
09:39 <+Ryozuki> i see

09:52 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master dc08ac2 Dennis Felsing: Version 11.4.2
10:23 <@deen> maybe it's not such a good idea to reboot the servers around midnight. I'll mostly be offline then and can only react in the morning when something goes wrong
10:23 <@deen> I guess I'll change the time to 08:00 AM instead

20:15 <+Ryozuki> deen, after i delete ddnet-info.json and re-execute ddnet (11.4.2) it creates a ddnet-info.json.tmp which is never converted to a .json file and i dont see the ddnet servers
20:15 <+Ryozuki> if i rename the .tmp file to back to .json it works
