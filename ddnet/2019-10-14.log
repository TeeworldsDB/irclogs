01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> padding should not be an  issue on most implementations
01:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but what if someone compiles ddnet for some exotic ancient computer that requires weird alignment? ðŸ˜›
02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 4af4f0f44cd921556932d01e4d0e57963e715eda90af5e8aa1a9de475d2edbc5

02:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What happened here even ðŸ˜¦
02:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I io_write the top one, I get the bottom one when i io_read it ðŸ˜›
02:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was only writing the first 4 bytes ðŸ˜›
09:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 your blog could do with a <link> for the rss feed, then some feed readers can detect it automatically
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If anyone hasn't seen it: https://heinrich5991.github.io/blog/blog/one-tick-unfreeze
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen so do we know why ddnet7 disappeared? and is it coming back?
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it disappeared because foko deleted it
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Wait there isn't any back-up/ bin where you can pull it back from the death?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I mean why has he authorisation to delete such a big file?
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @HMH what was the issue with your queue implementation?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because I gave him the permissions, removed them now, will restore the repo later
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do we have any proof he did it? because he told me he didnt.
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> @Learath2 as far as I remember it worked fine but it forces you to wrap everything into some pointertype like `std::unique_ptr`.
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm, why is it so complex? ðŸ˜„
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> Also, for my rpc stuff I implemented something simpler: https://github.com/H-M-H/ddnet/blob/rpc/src/base/tl/queue.h
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wouldn't a lock and a queue be enough?
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> Probably because I wanted it to do too much at the time ðŸ˜›
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One more question, what is the point of having a mutex and a cv?
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @ChillerDragon yes github has an audit log
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @HMH Oh actually I have one more question about your last queue, to push you need to acquire the lock, but if the consumer is stuck waiting on a condition variable, the queue will never be non empty, how does that work?
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh the wait unlocks doesn't it
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> The mutex is used for syncronization of the cv, e.g. cv.wait(lck) changes state of the cv and then releases the lock.
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <HMH> So, what do you want to do with a threadsafe queue ?
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was doing some work on sql (im not anymore since you are doing it)
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Was just curious after that ðŸ™‚
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> TIL you can also do `m_CV.wait(Lock, [this]{return m_Queue.empty()});`
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hitting yourself when shooting through other tees?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wouldn't you just hit the other tee @jao?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> with hit others disabled obviously
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait, when hit others is disabled it should just go through the other tees, no?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What happens currently?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes but if it then hits yourself it has no effect
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> with the fix it works like it wouldnt go through a tee
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I thought it should go through
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> it does
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but, it shouldnt go through yourself
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wait i show u
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> if i shoot like that through a tee the shotgun has no effect on myself

16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> but if there is no tee the shotgun works
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> on myself
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh very interesting
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/5b4d7a465899caab08156db44036a96b460d89be#diff-fed628155279726949415666da39fd58
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> idk why it was removed
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao your change looks like it's the opposite of what greyfox added
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you sure it's correcT?
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> correct*
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> how is it the opposite?
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he returns when itâ€™s same and i ignore if itâ€™s not the same
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, sorry, skimmed too fast ðŸ˜›
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> dont merge yet

17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is that normal?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> feels like my irc messes up timestamps when running in screen or is this a fetaure? xd
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>

17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> worked fine on a different irc tho hm
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well i guess i can live with it. In case any1 has a easy fix for it yell it at me pls ðŸ™‚
