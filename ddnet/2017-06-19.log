00:00 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> yeah working on a VR game to get admitted to a lab here in turkey (they have 6 oculuses, 2 htc vives, PSVR, OSVR, dual r9 390x all around)
00:00 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> it's like a dreamworld ðŸ˜›
00:00 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> :o. What kind of game?
00:00 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> simulation ?
00:00 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> or just VR experience
00:00 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> the beauty of being in turkey is everyone here is straight garbage or don't care about their work
00:01 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> working on a sandbox kind of game
00:01 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> minecraft ðŸ˜®
00:01 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> in VR :oop:
00:02 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> have you any screenshots/previews?
00:02 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> me and a friend we push out prototypes in like 3-4 days while it takes the turkish guys in the same lab 4 months to get a working prototype of a bloody drum game
00:02 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Savander not on this pc
00:02 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> doesn't look to impressive yet without any models or textures ðŸ˜›
00:03 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜ƒ but works so
00:03 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> Unity have assets store
00:03 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i really like it.
00:03 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> i'm no good at graphics work
00:03 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I can focus on coding
00:03 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> instead of making textures/models
00:03 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> cause, i can't
00:03 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well my friend is a gfx guy so he got that covered
00:03 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh, that's nice
00:04 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> My friends, are generally programmers
00:04 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> (those which want to make games)
00:04 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> :<
00:05 < Learath2> i have lots of friends who want to make games
00:05 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> we don't fit hehe ðŸ˜›
00:05 < Learath2> none of which seem to want to put any work in it
00:05 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> they put
00:05 < Learath2> so i end up making a working prototype with all the code working and they just never deliver on any level design or modelling
00:05 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> then even did some prototypes, but we started maybe few months ago, to think and work on something
00:05 < Learath2> then i feel like choking my friends to death
00:06 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> If they don't want to, then maybe you should find someone else
00:06 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> who really wants to make games
00:06 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> not just saying
00:06 < Learath2> i have like 5 people nagging me saying they want to make games
00:07 < Learath2> i don't start on anything until they deliver a GDD and some work
00:07 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> haha, right
00:07 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> i made one GDD
00:07 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> with friends
00:07 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> a week ago
00:08 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> but it is in polish, so you wouldn't understand./
00:08 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> I force them to make that stuffs.. projects, mechanics
00:08 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> before starting anything
00:08 < Learath2> someone uploaded the wrong episode of a series on this stupid site
00:08 < Learath2> now i have to find the episode somewhere else :/
00:08 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> hmm?
00:09 < Learath2> some guy just uploaded S04E13 and named it S04E12
00:10 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> what a devil!
00:10 < ddnet-discord> <Learath2> yes quite evil indeed
00:11 < Learath2> i'll go get some sleep, nice chatting with you Savander
00:11 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> good night ðŸ˜ƒ
00:12 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe you can listen to polish disco polo
00:12 < ddnet-discord> <Savander> before sleeep? ha! ðŸ˜›
