00:14 < breton> hi
00:15 <+breton> i ran into a weird issue with ddnet binary for linux
00:15 <+breton> i've just migrated to a new computer, and all buttons get double-pressed in ddnet
00:15 <+breton> for example when i press t to open chat, i already have t pre-entered. When i press backspace, 2 symbols get removed. Or when i press enter, the chat is closed and opened immediately
00:17 <+breton> same from the main menu - when i join the server by hitting "Enter", i see the loading screen for a moment and then "Enter" gets pressed again, which hits the "Cancel" button
00:17 <+breton> how do i fix it?
00:17 <+breton> i run Debian with KDE
00:17 <+breton> *Debian stable
00:21 <+breton> but first i will try with an empty user
00:35 <+breton> oooh yes, i've found it. Fcitx, which is installed in Debian by default, caused the problem. I purged it and the problem got fixed.
