01:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> @bano  bano
01:17 <+ddnet-discord> <bano> yo
01:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> @bano https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/880 its a fork of ddnet
01:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> so its not in master yet
01:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> What happened to trashmap?
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> hey,
12:41 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> is there a way to control the client zoom server side?
12:47 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> no
12:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ok thanks
12:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> think we only allow zoom in certain gamemodes @Laboon
12:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> It's not like, we can  control how much people player see?
12:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Yes that is possible I guess
12:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> but atm im working on a spectator mode and it would be cool if i could contorl the zoom
12:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well it is possible to just snap in a radius or inside an arena to prevent looking outside
12:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I guess you cant :/
12:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> but nope you cant control zoom
12:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ok ,_,
12:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> would be a cool feature for developers I guess xD
12:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, ddnet should be standalone game!
12:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> eventually with teeworlds servers, which will tell you
12:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> For example on ddnet tournaments you could choose the option "spectate best 2" and with the zoom you can control that the spectator always sees both teams
12:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "if you want to play, download ddnet client"
12:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> yes i dont like that the normal teeworlds version is on steam either
13:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we could break vanilla compat any day we want
13:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why you don't like?
13:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> becaues new players won't stick to the game
13:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @Learath2  it would give you a lot of more possibilities ðŸ˜„
13:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> teeworlds is cool i guess, but it sucks that most new players only get to see death match or ctf
13:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> which gets boring pretty fast imo
13:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> meh, i started play this game
13:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> when there wasn't any mods
13:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> yeah they leave before they ever uncheck the vanilla filter
13:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I started playing on block servers and tournament servers ðŸ˜„
13:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> @Savander  me too but there would be more players if they would know that teeworlds isnt just "dm and ctf" ðŸ˜„
13:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I know
13:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> But i can't really agree!
13:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Teeworlds itself should be more interesting
13:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜ƒ
13:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I mean, standard gametypes should be more interesting
13:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like in others games
13:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you see standard gametypes, then WOWHOWHOW
13:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i found mods
13:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> YEA
13:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> yes thats cool i guess hahahaha
13:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> but it sucks that teeworlds isnt really continued being updated anymore
13:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> when was the last official teeworlds update?
13:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> think 0.7 is back on schedule ðŸ˜„
13:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> really?
13:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> they're releasing 0.7? ðŸ˜®
13:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Any news ?
13:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Show me lol ðŸ˜® im interested
13:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> oy said he found someone to do the art a couple of months ago in irc
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Ah oy
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> oooh
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> thats cool i guess
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> But official teedevs don't want to continue
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> would it be possible to maybe work togethre?
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so i bet, teeworlds never will be updated
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> oy is one of the official devs
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> at least, not official version
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> the project is oy's now
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> so that the normal 0.7 client includes the ddnet features as well?
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I know that @Learath2
13:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> read what he said on forum
13:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> and he controls the website aswell
13:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> so it'll be as official as it ever was when oy releases a 0.7
13:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if that ever happens that is
13:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> idk wether it would be good or not
13:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i know from the jump from 0.5 to 0.6 i didnt know where to play lol
13:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> 0.5 servers went down but there werent that many 0.6 servers in the beginning
13:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Oy on forum said, that Teeworlds0.7 will be never released
13:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> and the player count on 0.5 servers dropped as well
13:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> took us a while to get ddrace ported to 0.6
13:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Savander when?
13:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> which sucked because there was no tournament mod for 0.6 >:
13:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> if you are talking about that old post, it doesn't matter since a couple of months ago he came on irc and said he could go on
13:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=120356#p120356
13:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> couple months ago
13:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Okay, he can. Why he don't want help of other devs?
13:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like heinrich, you
13:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> deen ?
13:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> they hate you because of ddnet or what
13:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> he *
13:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i dont get the hate for ddnet
13:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> he doesn't have the time for it and he doesn't want to admit it
13:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> when the server of the tournament mod went online for a few hours some people wrote "oh wow on ddnet no thanks" and left
13:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i dont get this, if they want to play the mod they should. why would they disconnect just because they dont want to support ddnet?
13:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I have a pullrequest on teeworlds/teeworlds that was open for 4 years now
13:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I know, for me there should be more mainteiners
13:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> which won't happen
13:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> so there will most prolly be no new tw release
13:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yea, so let's make ddnet standalone
13:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> no point in breaking vanilla compatibility now
13:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and fuck backward compatibility
13:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> If we ever get sth that we can't do because of back compat we can talk about it then
13:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> backward compatibility i scool as it is
13:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> it still brings a few players to ddnet i guess
13:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> and if we break vanilla compat any mod that isn't updated will no longer work
13:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> so no fng no zcatch either
13:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> and most features can still be enabled exclusively on ddnet clients from the serverside
13:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> and no mods that doesn't implement our new protocol either
13:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You still need to think about vanilla players
13:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> on serverside it makes it a little more complicated you're right but not that much imo
13:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I mean, it's talking shit now but, even if you would add something great to ddnet, but if it can't be compatible with vanilla, you can't
13:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we can, it just looks bad on vanilla clients
13:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> And, why we woudl break mods ?
13:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> ddnet clients wouldn't be able to speak vanilla protocol either
13:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> im not talking about  making new game,
13:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so protocol, like now woudl stay
13:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> no?
13:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so fng, and other gamemodes would work
13:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> well what do you think vanilla compat is?
13:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You don't understand me
13:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> @Learath2  you could still do 2 different protocols, one for ddnet and one for vanilla
13:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> im talking about ddnet servers.
13:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you want the servers not to accept vanilla clients?
13:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> that way you could make ddnet server standalone but you could still play on normal servers with your client
13:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You do not maintain fng, vanilla etc.
13:15 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You maintain ddnet servers, so you would have more possibilities
13:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I dont get it
13:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> xD
13:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You are too pro i guess
13:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Laboon sure but why, it's not that much work to keep vanilla compat now that we have extended protocol
13:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we can even have new snap object types
13:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> hmmm
13:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> idk wouldnt it make the development of features like the antiping more easy?
13:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> wouldn't matter for antiping
13:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> antiping basically assumes some stuff to make predictions look better
13:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> hmm okay
13:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> one question i have is, couldn't the ddnet client play the game more "on its own?"
13:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> anyway, about tw0.7
13:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> for example when you have a lagg spike 90% of the time the hook doesnt get registered
13:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> How it would be hard, to make ddnet compatile with that version?
13:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I mean, it's even possible to push people to that version ?
13:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> You mean if it ever releases?
13:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea
13:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> It'd be painful to move ddnet to 0.7 given we'd get billions of merge conflicts ðŸ˜„
13:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> (y)
13:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I guess we'd just pretend we are a 0.7 client/server at that point
13:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ddnet is first bastion of teeworlds
13:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so D:
13:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I don't remember how different the protocol is but shouldn't be too hard to have a layer that converts the messages for 0.7 clients and servers
13:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> generally, i think that
13:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> even if it ever released
13:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's a bit too late
13:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> @Laboon you could make that prediction, but then if the packet gets dropped you'd buzz around
13:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> too much mods, based on tw0.6
13:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Oh ok that makes sense
13:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I think normal prediction assumes smooth movement, don't really remember what antiping does
13:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i bbet, predict people
13:24 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> grenade trajectory
13:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on ddrace is useful, when you have big ping and have to drag
13:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> someone
13:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> cause client can predict it
13:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> dragging with a high ping is cancer lol
13:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> use antiping,  noooot that bad
13:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> naa
13:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's predictable
13:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> not really, what if the person you are dragging moves?
13:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then it shakes
13:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but i mean, dragging through the freeze
13:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> oh yep that one works nicely
13:26 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> antiping is great for fng
13:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> antiping works perfectly on dummy drags
13:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> antiping works perfectly on dummy drag masp
13:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> antiping works perfectly on dummy drag maps
13:27 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> the shaking while frozen was annoying but they fixed that in fng2
13:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we wanted to fix shaking while frozen, noone wanted it
13:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i think the problem with my internet is that i have lagg spikes
13:27 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> lol why would anyone oppose that change
13:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> that is rather difficult to fix i guess
13:27 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> shaking while frozen is the most annoying part of the old openfng servers
13:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> noby, you can see if you are moving right/left
13:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> if you jumping
13:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i like the shaking when frozen
13:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> with that i know when there is a laggspike
13:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> see there are people who like it ðŸ˜„
13:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @Learath2, try to play with dummy
13:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we had perfect freeze prediction in ddwar and people didn't like that one either
13:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and be sure
13:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that your dummy is pressing right
13:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> now you can see, because it try to move if you are on the dummy
13:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> btw, you can make it optional? ðŸ˜„
13:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> like, true by default, but if someone like that shaky tee
13:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then disable !
13:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> can't have options for everything ðŸ˜„
13:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> why not
13:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> noone would know what to configure then
13:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> full configurable game
13:30 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> it is a config option in fng2
13:30 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> smooth freeze mode
13:30 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> enabled by default + prevents shaking while frozen
13:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Are you assuming that ddnet has a lot of options! ?
13:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Did you ever saw cs:go settings?
13:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can do like everything
13:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
13:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> best i could think of is do a "advanced seetings " button
13:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> we have such a button, it's the console
13:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
13:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> right!
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> LEARN people how to change something
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> D
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> well
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> xD
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> then, they will learn others!
13:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :>
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> there are a few useful threads on ddnet.tw
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i like the bind thread for example ðŸ˜„
13:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> : D
14:59 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> @Laboon server can set who the client is spectating
14:59 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> so you can force people to watch someone specific
15:00 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> (didn't read all of the chat, not sure if this was clarified)
15:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> Is there a way to make the client spectate a specific coordination?
15:00 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> no
15:00 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> only follow a player
15:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> I'm sure I did it with the 0.6 src a few months ago
15:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> not the ddnet source
15:00 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> or maybe there is? we didn't change much from 0.6 in spectating
15:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> m_viewpos just changes which chars are synched
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ill look into the 0.6 src
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> I don't think you can fix the spec position
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> just make them watch the person?
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> tee*
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> it should be good enough, no?
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> naaa
15:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> if everything else fails haha
15:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> could maybe rig something up by putting fake players in the middle of the arena and forcing follow on those
15:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ill take a look how i did it in the 0.6 source and tell you how if i did it
15:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> or not D
15:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ðŸ˜„
15:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> because im sure it worked hahaha
15:03 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> try setting m_Position and m_UsePosition?
15:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> you mean in camera.cpp?
15:04 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> no
15:05 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> i don't know where, just guessing
15:05 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> or m_X and m_Y in SpectatorInfo
15:05 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> this didn't work
15:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> I don't find m_Position in a server file . _.
15:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> I guess I did it
15:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> m_SpectatorID = 1;
15:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> m_ViewPos = vec2(0,0);
15:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> I guess the spectatorID needs to be above -1
15:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> use the grep magick
15:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> grep magick?
15:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :V
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> cat *.h | grep -nri "m_Position"
15:17 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> i guess?
15:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> ctrl f did it for me but thanks haha ðŸ˜„
15:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> does your control f searches recursively over all folders?
15:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> in visual studio you can check "search current project"
15:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> and it will search through all files in the project
15:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ik
15:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> but console is lot faster
15:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> and visualy easier
15:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> (i used vs)
15:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> i guess youre right here hahaha
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> but im on windows 10 does cat work here? xD
15:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> yep
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> why is this message red
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> seriously? ðŸ˜® tried in the cmd but i just got the message that "cat" is an unrecognized command
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://sourceforge.net/projects/getgnuwin32/
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Laboon> thanks!
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> red = not sent
15:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> discord is slow for some reason
15:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> my last command is somewhat wrong `grep -nr "m_aClients" *.cpp` is better
16:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> When i build ddnet-master to Release (but not debug), i get  a bug where, if you alt-tab out when in the editor, the mouse current position glitches out and x or y becomes NaN
16:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> this doenst happen if i run the client downloaded from ddnet.tw, so i guess its something happening at my end
17:10 <@deen> or undefined behaviour @Dr. Jekyll
17:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> Hm?
17:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> https://imgur.com/UgKWKgf
17:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> The upshot of this is the mouse pointer is unusable in editor and needs to be quit
