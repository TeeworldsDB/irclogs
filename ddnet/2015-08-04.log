16:22 <@deen> I added some easier issues: https://github.com/def-/ddnet/issues
18:22 < uchar> hi
18:22 < uchar> tool diff is made?
19:01 <@EastByte> uchar: hellow
19:02 <@EastByte> we don't have a diffing tool yet
19:02 < uchar> i can do something?
19:02 < uchar> and HI EastByte  ;)
19:03 <@EastByte> maybe we should ask Chairn first to check what he is doing
19:03 <@EastByte> uchar: nice to see you want to participate on ddnet =)
19:04 < uchar> thx EastByte :)
19:05  * EastByte is afk eating pizza
19:06 < uchar> EastByte, that fstd don't read you... xD
19:06 < uchar> SNR detected
19:06 < uchar> :P
19:11 < fstd> uchar: since you aren't realizing the difference, he recently talked before announcing that he's going to be afk
19:11 < fstd> that's a matter of politeness
19:11 < fstd> in your case, you were silent for hours before suddenly announcing you're afk
19:11 < uchar> xDD
19:12 < fstd> also protip: if you don't want me to notice, avoid hilighting me :)
19:12 < uchar> i like that you read it.. its your name, disable highlight on your client :B
19:13  * fstd scratches head
19:13  * uchar can't say nothing
19:13 < fstd> i'm not complaining about being hilighted
19:14 < uchar> it was just a humorous comment
19:16 < fstd> the best humor is the one that makes sense though :P
19:28 < Nimda> Propagate by Element Finland just released on Solo at 2015-08-04 19:21
23:54 < o_be_one> hey :)
23:54 < o_be_one> is there a way to get players ip just by telling them to refresh server list even if they use DDNet ?
