00:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> @furo321: fellow 0.7 porter! Keep up the epic prs
00:01 < bridge> <furo321> You deleted your comment? I saw it, and then it was gone when I refreshed :D
00:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Dude I forgot that I was the one who added it to 0.7 while I wrote the comment
00:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> And suddenly realized how cringe my comment was praising this feature
00:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It totally hit me when I clicked on the pr you linked.
00:27 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
00:27 < bridge> <Ewan> humble chiller dragon moment
00:31 < bridge> <chillerdragon> More like Alzheimer chiller moment. Imagine forgetting which features you added.
01:21 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> at this point its going to be harder to add new features without making spaghetti code
01:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure what you're talking about. we added features that are useful independent of 0.7
01:24 < bridge> <_voxeldoesart> I mean with so many 0.7 reliant updates I feel like it's going to be a harder focus to balance that instead of cleaning up what we already have.
01:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you point me to such a "0.7 reliant update"?
01:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think we have any

10:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> like a new server that cant do master server connections axaxax
10:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> i bought a 2tb m2 pcie4 ssd
10:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pog
10:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how much
10:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh and the trollest thing is that the server shows up in my clients browser just fine
10:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but it spams my logs
10:20 < bridge> <ryozuki> 100
10:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 185.223.31.160 this is me
10:33 < ChillerDragon> should this work?
10:33 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1700818428.png
10:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> maybe its because master1 failed it fell back to this
10:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> running a client on that vps shows an empty server browser ._.
10:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> same here this works fine ``curl https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json``
10:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> installed the new m2
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> replaced the one i had windows on
11:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> i decided to ditch that for now
11:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nowadays i only use windows to test bugs of other windows users üò¨

11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for like 100ms xdd
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> well better than a non m2 ssd
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> and a hdd
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> its pcie4 too
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u got 2 m2 slots?
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok 2tb of those is a normal ssd
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got 2 m2 slots
11:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> and 1 normal ssd
11:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then copying between these two might be slow

11:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> they both pcie4
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno how expensive your mb is xd
11:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think it costed me 200
11:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they both are connected to a pcie4 lane yes

11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> noooo
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i should switch places of the m2 then
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have the 500gb on the pcie4
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> and the 2tb on the pcie3 then
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think
11:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> how can i know? xd
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> the bother is that the pcie4 m2 slot is under the gpu
11:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> zzz
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess u could benchmark xdd
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
11:09 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i'd suggest if you do that only benchmark reading
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> meh its ok
11:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> they are fast enough
11:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean, normally u wont notice anyway xDD

11:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this is important for you tho xD
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i see xd
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also had a pcie adapter
11:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> for another m2

11:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks is there pcie5 m2 ssds?
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i bet so, but probs cost way too much
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbh pcie5 came so early
11:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it was lke pcie4 was skipped xD

11:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah

11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok ext4

16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
16:02 < bridge> <patiga> was too lazy for that so far :d
16:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but between tees is weird too üòÑ
16:03 < bridge> <patiga> but Pog is
16:04 < bridge> <patiga> that apart from tees initially being at 0, 0 all the time, the entire render pipeline worked first try üéâ (after the shader syntax fixes)
16:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
16:05 < bridge> <patiga> honestly I would've bet against that  xd
16:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when u have skins working, u gotta release a version üòÑ
16:07 < bridge> <patiga> sure :)
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'm interested into your solution now with skin texture arrays etc üòÑ
16:08 < bridge> <patiga> eeeh
16:08 < bridge> <patiga> I'm going with the ddnet approach now
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah lol
16:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
16:08 < bridge> <patiga> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twgpu/-/tree/tee-rendering?ref_type=heads
16:09 < bridge> <patiga> this is the last commit with the weird gpu-based approach
16:09 < bridge> <patiga> you can try it out in the demo-viewer thingy
16:10 < bridge> <patiga> but yea it isn't all that far, I think I got until hook and then stopped at the ninja hadouken effect
16:10 < bridge> <patiga> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twgpu/-/tree/new-approach?ref_type=heads
16:11 < bridge> <patiga> this is the current wip
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah nice
16:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for effects i'd really like to introduce multi texturing support
16:11 < bridge> <patiga> twgpu/src/sprites is the new component
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> there are often only few particles, then others (with other textures) and since render order matters, this causes lot of draw calls
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> same for quad layers actually
16:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> players are not really a problem, since u usually dont have more than like 64p or let's say 256p in a worst case
16:13 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but particles sum up very fast üòÑ
16:13 < bridge> <patiga> whats wrong with the quad layer?
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah quad layers are maybe not that bad.
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess i just want to test out, if batching makes it a bit better
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as said in our call, streaming quads is mostly as fast as ddnet's approach
16:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so this kinda sucks
16:14 < bridge> <patiga> hm :/
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for particles i'd say it's worse tho.
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ninja particles, gun trails etc.
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they are often mixed, since they are on a per player basis, batching all together would be nice
16:17 < bridge> <patiga> hm, batching most of those doesn't sound dramatic in terms of visual changes
16:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it is a visual change üòÑ
16:17 < bridge> <patiga> yea ^^
16:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i guess most of the time u'd not notice indeed
16:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks friday rust question when
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno.
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> when will i not waste my time thinking about design choices in rust xdd
16:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i still often struggle when i want idiomatic vs perf etc.
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> well thats on u
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> both are safe
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u dont use unsafe
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
16:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> "Now i am become Rust, Destroyer of Unsafe code"
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> brb making rusty coffee
16:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> lately i learn a lot more about llvm apis
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> specially on how to make a shared library programatically
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> from mlir
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> without clang
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> the only thing i dont know how to do programatically is to call a linker api
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is no docs
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> for now i call the linker as a process
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah yeah, thanks for reminder that you have a cool job
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> like a command
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok i wont tell more
16:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> my point is, iwanted  to make a blog post
16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xD
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> i said this but tbh i cant shutup xd
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh
16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's ok xD
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> im in the llvm discord
16:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill ask there
16:35 < bridge> <cyberfighter> if you use blockworlds as entities the unused tiles button becomes black, but if you click no and yes again it becomes red
16:35 < bridge> <cyberfighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1177633589081415770/image.png?ex=657337bf&is=6560c2bf&hm=e3ed0222f3c87de2ff84ebf66482deef15bfa04e7e07194aa5d30d52521bff2c&

16:35 < bridge> <cyberfighter> Bug??? maye??????
16:35 < bridge> <cyberfighter> Bug??? maybe??????
16:36 < bridge> <cyberfighter> also kind of surprised fddrace isnt an option in the entities
16:40 < bridge> <kekomonter> All custom entites(non-ddr) don't have this button
16:52 < bridge> <furo321> Yeah, it's a bug. "Allow Unused" is only possible for DDNet entities. I'll fix it.
17:09 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> you know what first came to mind my when I saw yours and Chillers msg xD
17:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wor
17:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot
17:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and who is "yours" xd
17:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> it's a reply to this
17:11 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> > [3:30 PM]Jupstar ‚ú™: not reproducable on my AI
17:13 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I was taking a nap so my mind was clouded but after seeing those msgs I slept a lil better :)

17:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks rust friday done
17:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: try the masterping tool
18:04 < bridge> <patiga> ah I just interpolated from newer to older snaps accidentally, wrong direction
18:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> i decided
18:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> expect a blog post about llvm and mlir soon
18:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
18:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> > title = "Intro to LLVM and MLIR with Rust and Melior"
18:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> > description = "Learning MLIR with too many dialects."
18:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust pun intended
18:27 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 you forgot the readme again
18:27 < ChillerDragon> ``cargo run ipv4 https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json`` this?
18:28 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1700846969.png
18:28 < ChillerDragon> yea i got no ipv6
18:29 < ChillerDragon> wait i do
18:29 < ChillerDragon> hm
18:29 < ChillerDragon> maybe thats the issue?
18:29 < ChillerDragon> ill try turning off ipv6
18:30 < ChillerDragon> hm didnt help
19:29 < bridge> <learath2> I planned my entire rework of the curl multi pr around `curl_multi_get_handles`, turns out it was added in 8.4.0 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
19:29 < bridge> <learath2> I will become unreasonable if I have to rewrite this one more time
19:35 < bridge> <Ewan> why can‚Äôt you use 8.4.0
19:35 < bridge> <learath2> Way too new
19:35 < bridge> <learath2> I'll just go back to the ugly unordered_map whatever
19:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> uh, 8.4.0 is actually only 13 days old (released 2023-11-11)
19:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> how did you even know about this API?
19:37 < bridge> <learath2> I wanted to get rid of the map of running requests, took a look at the api docs, there it was
19:37 < bridge> <learath2> Should have trusted that past me wasn't stupid
19:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the more i use all these awesome well tested rust crates, that are way too ez to use, the more i hate how much ddnet reinvents the wheel xd
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> ok
19:42 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
19:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki was right
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> all the time
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> since eternity
19:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> for eternity
19:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
19:49 < bridge> <Ewan> patrick, does god love us
19:50 < bridge> <learath2> It's a shame that std doesn't have a way to go from a pointer to an item in a `std::list` to an iterator at that item. It should be possible in O(1) in all implementations of it I can imagine
20:37 < bridge> <chairn> quantum doesn't help in this case afaik
20:39 < bridge> <chairn> solitary online on teeworlds üòÑ
20:40 < bridge> <chairn> has any of you ever written a soft float library?
20:41 < bridge> <chairn> my attempt is working but for some case, im always off by 1 in the mantissa...
20:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, I have not
20:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds fun though
20:49 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you give us the relevant snippets? üôÇ
20:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> heinrich any idea wat else i could try? :c
20:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you check whether you have IPv6 connectivity anywhere?
20:50 < bridge> <chillerdragon> i turned it off
20:51 < bridge> <chillerdragon> should work if its off right?
20:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ah okay nice `sv_register ipv6` fixed the server log spam
20:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ipv4\*
20:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> seems like my ipv6 is bugged but i dont need players to connect via ipv6 right now anyways i think
20:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> okay only question left is how do i fix the client browser
20:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> that explains why the server was logging errors and still showing up. ipv4 worked and ipv6 didnt.
20:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's the issue with the client browser?
20:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> i dont see any servers :(
20:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you access https://master1.ddnet.org/ddnet/15/servers.json in the browser?
20:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> i can access it via curl from the vps just fine
20:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> thats the weird thing
20:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> it also says task done
20:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> i feel like i have a filter on or something
20:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> can you send a screenshot?
20:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1700855896.png
20:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its a fresh vps install so ddnet should have any filters active other than searching for "Noivce" right?
20:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that seems like it's not an issue with the official ddnet client
20:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> please specify that
20:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nah its more a issue with my vps
20:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i specified that
20:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> somehow the master connection is bugged client and server side on this vps
21:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does  it make any sense to you that even if ipv6 is majorly bugged the browser wont work?
21:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if something bad happens on the network layer, it should say "error", not "done", I think
21:02 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea right?
21:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it also hits my api just fine
21:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and my api server could also speak ipv6
21:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> does the master server promote ipv6 somehow?
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
21:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> can i force the client to use ipv4?
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you could disable IPv6 on your machin
21:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> e
21:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thats what i tried earlier
21:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> let me try again
21:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6``
21:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this usually does the trick for me when i have ipv6 issues on some machine
21:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> not this time :( 
21:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the ip is gone in ``ip a``
21:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but the log still shows stun/6 i assume thats ipv6
21:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think you're facing an issue that is related to IPv6 at all
21:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean on the server side i got rid of error messages with ``sv_register ipv4``
21:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1700856475.png
21:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> stun4 OK stun6 err
21:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok fair i guess its off right now xd
21:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok turned it back on same result
21:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok nvm all those logs are useless
21:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i get the exact same logs on my machine if i turn off ipv6 and the browser still works
21:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea dont know im out of ideas
21:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> time to add random db_msgs
21:29 < bridge> <learath2> @heinrich5991 Is there anything better the register thread could be doing instead of running the http requests blocking?
21:49 < bridge> <chairn> erf, it's on my work computer üò¶
21:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oke @heinrich5991 i managed to print a bunch of server names in the log so the data seems to arrive. Seems to be an issue in my client or config. Weirdly can not reproduce it on any other server so i still would like to blame some bugged ipv6 or firewall xd
21:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but seems like this one is on me now
22:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not really. I guess it could not run 4 different threads
22:17 < bridge> <learath2> I need to somehow add a way to block on requests just for that usage
22:18 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
22:18 < bridge> <learath2> The previous iterations used an extra mutex and a condition variable but idk how I liked that
22:18 < bridge> <learath2> I'd rather have a semaphore but we don't have anonymous semaphores on macOS, nor do we have C++20 for the standard ones
22:19 < bridge> <learath2> Or ideally I'd have a futex there but that's also either lots of work for something that'll be used once (or behind C++20 where you can efficiently wait on atomics)
22:20 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think spinning on it is a good idea as http requests are rather slow, I could sleep on it, idk
22:22 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mean the "blocking run" is basically only used as a way to run some code on completion @learath2
22:24 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, if what is run on completion isn't slow maybe I should just run it in the curl thread and call it a day
22:25 < bridge> <learath2> eh nvm, it needs to acquire a lock, that's a bad idea
22:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> aaaaaaaaaaaa
22:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can reproduce
22:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> with ddnet
22:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> on my local machine
22:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> fuck yeah!
22:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its not my client nor the vps omg xd
22:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> give us the details!
22:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im opening the issue dw
22:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what a detour omg
22:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ipv6 xd
22:29 < bridge> <learath2> Idk how this keeps happening, everytime I finish this up I hate what I've created üòÑ
22:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which commit are you on?
22:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait you cant reproduce?
22:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg ur right xd
22:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait xd
22:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dude im tured
22:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> tired
22:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I haven't tried to reproduce
22:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dont bother
22:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> gimme a sec
22:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this is just standard "a user has opened an issue" questions ^^
22:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> especially regarding stuff that had fixes recently
22:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i see
22:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i merge quite frequently so i just assumed im recent enough to open an issue. Seems like the bug was fixed somewhen in the last days nice
22:44 < bridge> <learath2> Tbf, imo you should never open issues on our issue tracker when you are using your own fork
22:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> agree
22:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just tend to discover the bugs in the software i actually run and then i check wethere i have to fix it or not by running ddnet once
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nothing as amusing as chillerdragon
22:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im close to mental breakdown xd
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> pls no
22:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this debugging session was no fun
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do a reset
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this debug session never happened
22:46 < bridge> <cyberfighter> certified chillerdragon moment
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this debug session never happened
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this debug session never happened
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> this debug session never happened
22:46 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> did it help?
22:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
22:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> thank
