09:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> think I've seen it before. not sure in which context
09:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://edgarluque.com/blog/daily-gentoo/
09:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > this time I decided it wasn't that worth it encrypting my whole disk, so I went a simpler way.
09:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sounds like a bad idea
09:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the only benefit of that is less complexity. if that complexity is harder in gentoo than in arch linux, then I'd advocate against using gentoo
10:16 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its not harder its the same
10:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its just that  i  didnt want to bother at a time
10:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and well its not my laptop its my home pc
10:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk i just thought it wasnt worth it
10:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also i think there is slightly less disk perfomance
10:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and one of the reasons i wanted gentoo too was to achieve maximum perf
10:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> https://blog.apnic.net/2021/06/17/how-a-small-free-ip-tool-survived/
10:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> one of my grips with c++ is that = can mean many different things in many contexts, and overloard right?
10:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> in rust u always know what it means
10:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> one of my grips with c++ is that = can mean many different things in many contexts, and overloads right?
10:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 u sure they arent called?
10:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it compiles 😉
10:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well i guess that  makes sense then xD
10:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 what do i need to get asan ubsan etc? just clang? valgrind?
10:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ubsan clang I think
10:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not sure about asan etc.
10:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ubsan: pass `-fsanitize=undefined`

10:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if it doesnt say anything and just ddnet logs it means all is ok?

10:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> doesnt show up on ldd

10:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> seems like the text width isnt calculated nicely
10:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for the bg
10:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki what mail server do you use? is it easy to set up?
10:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i used to use postfix + dovecot, with mysql but nowadays i would use sqlite
10:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but i dont self host since i had issues
10:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with the wiki emails for chinese people
10:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I wanna self host because I only send mails to myself
10:59 < bridge_> <learath2> Selfhosting mail is fun to set up, but sadly big corpo mail hosters just filter all 3rd parties now
10:59 < bridge_> <learath2> Cartel behaviour
10:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> postfix + dovecot aint bad but if u never setup a email server maybe is a bit
10:59 < bridge_> <learath2> And they will never tell you why they filtered your mail, so you can’t even fix it
11:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm just sending mails to myself
11:00 < bridge_> <ryozuki> postfix for smtp, dovecot for imap
11:00 < bridge_> <learath2> Can’t go wrong with postfix dovecot combo
11:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u use unix users its easier
11:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> if u want virtual users u need more setup
11:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> opendkim if u want dkim
11:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I want to not receive emails from the oustide
11:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but send emails to the outside
11:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> postfix then
11:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-postfix-as-a-send-only-smtp-server-on-ubuntu-22-04
11:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> thanks 🙂
11:02 < bridge_> <learath2> Still need the dovecot for imap,  but yeah you can have postfix sendonly
11:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 beware cloudflare doesnt protect MAIL dns records
11:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i forgot the name of them
11:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> heinrich5991.de isn't behind cloudflare
11:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ok
11:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just sayin
11:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> MX
11:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> btw, I think
11:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
11:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> postfix on its own will not run a server for receiving mail from the outside? no matter how I misconfigure it?
11:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think the key is
11:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> inet_interfaces = loopback-only
11:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hmmm
11:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that sounds like restricting what I send
11:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that sounds like also restricting what I send
11:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> inet_interfaces (default: all)
11:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
11:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     The local network interface addresses that this mail system receives mail on.
11:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it doesnt say that here
11:08 < bridge_> <learath2> It only restricts where you send from
11:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#inet_interfaces
11:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you both say conflicitng things 😄
11:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i say what the doc says
11:09 < bridge_> <learath2> That setting will make the smtp server only bind to loopback. So it’ll effectively disable inbound mail from outside, but it’ll also stop outbound mail from outside
11:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so it'll open another socket for sending mail to the outside?
11:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think he means u cant connect to the smtp server with ur mail client and send a email?
11:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but not sure
11:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> there is also this https://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtp_bind_address
11:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk all tuts point to setting that
11:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> loopback
11:12 < bridge_> <learath2> Yes, this is what I’m saying. Atleast that’s how I remember it
11:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> seems to work. thanks @ryozuki @learath2

11:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3954
11:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> we need to think about if we want to merge those
11:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @learath2 what  u say
11:21 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i would merge them, but idk xd
11:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well i reviewed 2 prs now
11:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> gg
11:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> been long since i did ddnet stuff xd

11:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 22mins 💀
12:29 < bridge_> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks have you used lavapipe before?
12:29 < bridge_> <learath2> I say I'm scared
12:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
12:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Even on windows
12:31 < bridge_> <learath2> Do you know if I can somehow spoof `VkPhysicalDeviceType` it returns?
12:32 < bridge_> <learath2> This game refuses to use a device with type `VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU`
12:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yes it only uses it as last resort
12:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or by manually select in graphics settings
12:33 < bridge_> <learath2> I'm forcing it properly, the game just refuses to use it
12:33 < bridge_> <learath2> `[MainThread     ]             vulkan.cpp:2442   ERR| The only available GPU is of type VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU. Early exiting`
12:33 < bridge_> <learath2> I guess I'll need to compile my own copy of lavapipe or mesa :/
12:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If you even talking about ddnet xd
12:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Lol rip
12:35 < bridge_> <learath2> Linux gaming is still not there ngl, this optimus setup is PAIN
12:36 < bridge_> <learath2> I wonder if I can sneak in with frida and spoof the device type
12:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Optimus is simply trash xd
12:37 < bridge_> <learath2> Oh, I definitely did not know this simple fact. I'll get a better laptop next time
12:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I hope u don't need more than 20fps in your game
12:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Lavapipe isn't really fast
12:40 < bridge_> <learath2> I just need to check if it runs
12:47 < bridge_> <learath2> LOL, it does kinda run with DXVK -> Lavapipe
13:07 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> Hi 👋
13:07 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> 
13:07 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> Are you sick & tired of seeing your crypto just go sideways and never pump?
13:07 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> 
13:07 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> Day after day, you look at the same crypto charts and see little to no change?
13:07 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> 
13:07 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> You keep waiting and waiting for the next bull run, but it doesn’t happen…
13:07 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> 
13:08 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> Where’s the excitement of your crypto portfolio pumping to all-time highs?
13:08 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> 
13:08 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> You look at your charts and wonder, is this all there is?
13:08 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> 
13:08 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> You even consider selling your crypto, but then you remember the dude who bought a pizza with 10,000 Bitcoin - and you don’t want to be that guy…
13:08 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> 
13:08 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> Well, what if we told you there’s a way to INSTANTLY grow your crypto portfolio by 50%?
13:08 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman> (and yes, we said INSTANTLY!)
13:08 < bridge_> <Dale Y Pearlman>

13:17 < bridge_> <learath2> Mh, idk this is far more trouble than it's worth. I can't get ddnet running on the dgpu either
13:17 < bridge_> <learath2> I can see how someone might just think linux gaming is bad because it doesn't work on their laptop
13:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well i blame laptops being overly propietary
13:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> just dont get smth with optimus
13:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Is also the question how old your laptop is. BCS normally a Intel GPU also offers vk
14:09 < bridge_> <Iza> ChillerDragon: where can I download your client?
14:22 < bridge_> <learath2> Ok, I got it working, now I no longer have time to play, but still 😄
14:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
14:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> today i used raw ptrs on rust
14:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> sad day
14:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 🤓
14:23 < bridge_> <learath2> Haswell seems to have incomplete vk support, just couldn't get the game to run with it
14:24 < bridge_> <learath2> and both it and my dgpu only have Vk1.2 but DXVK needs Vk1.3, so I couldn't use the dx version of the game either
14:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what for?
14:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> to pass values to the MLIR JIT,
14:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> function call
14:25 < bridge_> <learath2> nvm apparently I only got ddnet working
14:26 < bridge_> <learath2> I'm about to start crying
14:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cant u return the laptop
14:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u will be in pains
14:26 < bridge_> <learath2> It's an old laptop of mine, perfectly strong enough to casually game on
14:27 < bridge_> <learath2> It's 10 years old but not like I'm trying to play god of war, I just wanted to play a bit of Hades
14:28 < bridge_> <learath2> Though at the very least I'm happy to report ddnet works fine on either gpu 😄
14:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
14:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cant it run opengl tho
14:31 < bridge_> <learath2> For ddnet all of our backends run fine on either gpu
14:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> jupstar pro
14:37 < bridge_> <learath2> This whole experience is very meh, how do you even do this on non optimus laptops? do you just run the dgpu all the time for everything?
14:38 < bridge_> <learath2> The whole graphics stack is SOOO convoluted, especially when you introduce wine in the middle, I still have no idea where what goes
14:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> get a linux friendly laptop
14:41 < bridge_> <learath2> Like for some reason the nvidia vk layer that forces their gpu does a GLX command, but why? What does GLX have to do with VK?
14:42 < bridge_> <learath2> It's a T440p, I think it's pretty well supported

15:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> quality software
15:40 < bridge_> <Voxel> when codecov 100%
15:47 < bridge_> <learath2> no u
15:48 < bridge_> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks do you have any idea why MESA has `MESA_VK_DEVICE_SELECT`? I was under the impression that mesa wasn't even supposed to be in the path when using a physical device
15:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe it just changes the order the devices are enumerated
15:51 < bridge_> <learath2> But is mesa even in the path to do something like that? I thought we only used mesa when doing software rendering
15:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I guess for Mesa drivers only. Because yeah normally it's job of the Vulkan loader
15:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But Mesa is basically a default implementation for all drivers.. which u customize to your need or accelerate to what is supported hardware wise
15:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> That's also why all these VK drivers pop up lately
15:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> They don't have to implement a lot to have a working VK driver .. it's just not very optimized ^^
15:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> "Vulkan Runtime
15:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The Vulkan runtime and utility code in Mesa provides a powerful shared core for building Vulkan drivers. It’s a collection of base structures (think base classes in OOO) which allow us to implement a bunch of the annoying hardware-agnostic bits in common code.
15:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> "
15:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://docs.mesa3d.org/vulkan/index.html
15:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Go ahead built yet another driver xd
15:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> mesa is a vulkan driver impl
15:56 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh
15:56 < bridge_> <learath2> It's quite hard to even understand what a "vulkan driver impl" is, it's not a kernel thing, is it an x driver?
15:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> like a opengl driver
15:57 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
15:57 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
15:57 < bridge_> <learath2> Hm, do all drivers go through MESA? I think nvidia and amd ship their own libGLs that have nothing to do with MESA, no?
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> OpenGL is bit different.. for Vulkan it's completely different anyway
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Vulkan doesn't need to know about x or Wayland etc
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Khronos gives surface extensions for these things
15:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Core Vulkan theoretically doesn't work on surfaces
15:59 < bridge_> <learath2> Focusing on VK, where does MESA come in then?
15:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Mesa is the llvm for GPU stuff xd
16:00 < bridge_> <learath2> That sounds wrong, llvm compiles stuff, mesa seems to provide implementations
16:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I guess u could say it's just a standard to unify the drivers
16:02 < bridge_> <learath2> It seems to me like mesa is directly the implementation for opengl/vk, but can also do hardware acceleration, for which it has drivers. Does that sound about right?
16:02 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I think on it's own it doesn't directly do hardware acceleration.. it's basically the interface for that
16:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But for Vulkan it's not need at all for Linux
16:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> BCS VK was designed to overcome these design flaws
16:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> There might be Mesa only VK extensions
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But that doesn't imply it's needed for most stuff
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> OpenGL is more tricky BCS on how it's built around surfaces and stuff like vsync
16:04 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Which isn't in opengls hand
16:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So to your question. It will probably only work for drivers built on Mesa
16:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Amdvlk will ignore it
16:06 < bridge_> <learath2> So MESA in the case of VK would be just another vulkan driver?
16:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The loader most probably too
16:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Well there are multiple mesa drivers
16:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Radv would be one
16:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Lavapipe another
16:07 < bridge_> <learath2> but it seems the nvidia one has nothing to do with mesa, so some vulkan drivers use mesa, others don't?
16:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
16:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> At least we don't know^^
16:08 < bridge_> <learath2> I see, quite confusing
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> What even confuses you 😄
16:09 < bridge_> <learath2> Everyone quite loosely calls things "drivers", I'm not sure where what plugs. The drivers I know plug into the kernel DRM
16:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Basically in Vulkan u never cominucate with anything that isn't Vulkan itself
16:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Only exception is the surface which gives u a Vulkan texture
16:10 < bridge_> <learath2> X seems to have drivers, Vulkan seems to have drivers, Mesa seems to have drivers
16:11 < bridge_> <learath2> Nvidia seems to call it's vulkan driver libGLX
16:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i am a rust driver
16:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> and soon car driver
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> X might be what ud can the surface extensions
16:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It has to give u space to draw on
16:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But it's not vks job to care about how it works . VK just expects it to work with Vulkan core
16:13 < bridge_> <learath2> Who provides the vulkan core?
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah if u want to know how the user space communicates with kernel
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Nvidia probably own kernel modules
16:13 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Anything. Else drm
16:14 < bridge_> <learath2> Even nvidia hooks into the drm nowadays
16:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Nobody directly
16:14 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> U can code your own
16:14 < bridge_> <learath2> So as far as vk is concerned, x and wayland doesn't exist
16:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yes. VK first of all is the API to communicate with the gpu
16:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> That the GPU has a surface is an extension
16:15 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Just like in real life xd

16:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the https://www.rust-lang.org/ homepage no longer says "no segfaults"
16:29 < bridge_> <chairn> both are physics change though...
16:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye im using rust
16:29 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its because i do lot of unsafe

16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> we need more logos
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I don't even know what makes Nvidia drivers always be trouble on Linux.. I guess some specific extensions desktop environment have to use
16:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Epic
16:32 < bridge_> <learath2> > Note that although both the GLVND and non-GLVND GLX client libraries share the same SONAME of libGL.so.1, only one of them at a time may be installed at a time. /usr/lib/libGL.so.367.57 is the non-GLVND GLX client library, and /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.0.0 is the GLVND GLX client library.
16:32 < bridge_> <learath2> > This library is also used as the Vulkan ICD.
16:32 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> That logo for video rendering xd
16:32 < bridge_> <learath2> This confused me so much today
16:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> OpenGL is mess anyway xd
16:33 < bridge_> <learath2> Something that is supposed to have nothing to do with opengl being inside an opengl library
16:33 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Not because opengl spec.. but everything around it
16:33 < bridge_> <learath2> I think I have one last unresolved question, you said surfaces are extensions, where can I read about them?
16:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Khr surface extension
16:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_surface.html
16:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It's named differently per od
16:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Os
16:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> The VK_KHR_surface extension is an instance extension. It introduces VkSurfaceKHR objects, which abstract native platform surface or window objects for use with Vulkan. It also provides a way to determine whether a queue family in a physical device supports presenting to particular surface.
16:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> 
16:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Separate extensions for each platform provide the mechanisms for creating VkSurfaceKHR objects, but once created they may be used in this and other platform-independent extensions, in particular the VK_KHR_swapchain extension.

16:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> c code
16:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> for u
16:36 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ryo the better Google
16:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im chatgpt5-rust
16:37 < bridge_> <learath2> I think I understand what the stack looks like for vulkan now, one day I'll spend some time figuring out what it looks like for gl
16:37 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It's not entirely different. Just that it's not really standarized
16:38 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> And that makes it a mess
16:38 < bridge_> <learath2> Well in that case it seems the X server is still in the way unless DRI is involved
16:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> In OpenGL u have glx being the loader.. or egl
16:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or Nvidia's thing
16:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> And all need to be implemented by e.g. sdl2
16:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Vulkan mostly doesn't need sdl at all
16:40 < bridge_> <Voxel> i dunno
16:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Or better: u need it less, because more stuff is standardized xd
16:41 < bridge_> <ryozuki> time for the 2nd coffee
16:41 < bridge_> <learath2> What does glvnd do?
16:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I think it's just vendor neutral loader
16:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So basically OpenGL stub(?)
16:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I'm not 100% sure but that's how I imagine it
16:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> So just that the shared object isn't   vendor at a specific location
16:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> At a vendor
16:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Anyway. This is simply a mess. I have no idea what the reasoning behind all this was.. it's probably like that before I and u were even born
16:44 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Lmao
16:45 < bridge_> <learath2> I know why there is a mess, it just developed over time rather than being designed properly
16:45 < bridge_> <learath2> All GL calls used to go through X for a while there before DRI was a thing
16:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But dri is dead isn't it
16:46 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I could swear I compile mesa without it nowadays xd
16:46 < bridge_> <learath2> Yep, it also died
16:47 < bridge_> <learath2> Actually the open source drivers might still be using it
16:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Let's see when Vulkan hits it's limit and we need yet another API xd
16:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> Learath2 and Jupstar are the same person
16:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> they're always confusing its and it's
16:48 < bridge_> <learath2> It'
16:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I could imagine one problem is maybe the static pipeline stuff
16:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its*

16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Recently[1], there was an exciting claim that a new type of material could conduct electricity perfectly at room temperature (this is what is meant by "superconductivity")[4]. This material was a version of lead-apatite [2], a type of mineral, that was altered with certain additions and made by combining two other materials, lanarkite and copper phosphide.
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > The researchers writing this report wanted to check if this claim was true. So, they made the same types of materials (lanarkite, copper phosphide, and the altered lead-apatite) and tested how they conducted electricity and reacted to magnets.
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > What they found was that lanarkite (Pb2SO5) didn't conduct electricity well at all, and copper phosphide Cu3P) conducted electricity similar to a semiconductor [3]. The altered lead-apatite, which was supposed to be the superconductor, behaved more like a semiconductor (a type of material that can sometimes conduct electricity, depending on conditions).
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Also, a key property of superconductors is that they repel magnets. But when the researchers put a magnet near their lead-apatite, there was no repulsion.
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
16:54 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Because of these tests, they're suggesting that the original claim about this room-temperature superconductor should be re-examined more carefully. It doesn't seem to behave like a superconductor in their tests.

16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I hear these news every other week
16:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the comments on hacker news says everyone needs to chill a little
16:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> while this is examined
16:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> basically the opposite of what ryo did :p
16:58 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i mean

16:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
16:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> precisely
16:58 < bridge_> <learath2> It seems AMDGPU does use DRI3, so many things, so many apis, so many interfaces aaaaa
17:00 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> But u usually use the gallium stuff

17:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> I hope we get maglevs
17:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Gallium is all in one I think xd

17:09 < bridge_> <learath2> https://blogs.igalia.com/itoral/2014/07/29/a-brief-introduction-to-the-linux-graphics-stack/ found a decent looking writeup, I think I'll just read someone elses research as researching these on your own is :pepeW:
17:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Maybe I should start being mesa dev
17:11 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Then you have trusted source
17:11 < bridge_> <chairn> well, not really surprising 😄
17:12 < bridge_> <learath2> Become mesa dev, convince them to drop support for everything but the last gen, then completely remake the entire stack so it's clean
17:12 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Good idea. Probably works just as well as here in ddnet xd
17:15 < bridge_> <learath2> Just too many things in the stack, they should reduce it all to one library exposing one function `drawTriangle`
17:17 < bridge_> <learath2> I'll also allow the DRM to exist
17:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The libraries are over complicated BCS they always have to present the idea of the render pipeline
17:17 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> In theory u only need compute shaders and nothing else
17:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> arent the graphics pipeline, specialized more optimized compute shaders?
17:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cuz they are more limited
17:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yes
17:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Basically
17:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but the limitation allows them to be faster
17:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> If hardware doesn't hit its limits soon I could imagine this is also just a matter of time
17:18 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Until u have actual full control over the full pipeline
17:19 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Yep.. but u could say that about anything in programming
17:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> A pure 2d pipeline with constraints directly for ddnet tile rendering would probs make it faster xd
17:20 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> We need that xd
17:25 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ehm, hi :D recently ive been doing something useless with demos and i came to chunk_header part. it says there're 3 types. i think i found something about snapshot and snapshot delta. but what to do when its message type :p

17:47 < bridge_> <learath2> Um, afaik they are just netmsgs, up to you what you do with them
17:48 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i mean how do i get info from that thing
17:48 < bridge_> <learath2> Fine for me
17:48 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i mean how to get info from that thing
17:55 < bridge_> <learath2> It's just a `CNetChunk` you'll need to parse it as such
17:55 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> ok, thanks  =]
17:55 < bridge_> <learath2> Oh wait no, it's not, it's the data in one directly
17:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> with weird padding at the end
17:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> after int compression or so
17:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it was realllly weird
17:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't remember
17:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what are you doing @milkeeycat? :0
17:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what are you doing @milkeeycat? 🙂
17:57 < bridge_> <learath2> So you can directly implement `CUnpacker`. After that you can check `UnpackMessageId` to see how we figure out the message id
17:58 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> maybe one day it will be web demo viewer but for now i just try to find out how demo files work
17:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah nice 🙂
18:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> can I see what you're programming, somewhere?
18:00 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> for now its just few structs :p

18:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> uh, rust 😄
18:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> cool 🙂
18:01 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> i dont rly know rust but writing it in js rn will be even worse :\
18:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what's bad about JS? ^^
18:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I heard you can use TS to add types 🙂
18:03 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> then i would need to find some library to work with binary or write something my own
18:03 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> but with deku i can just add few attributes and it works
18:04 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> surely, there's also a library for JS ^^
18:04 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> do you know the name fo it?
18:04 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but it's fine if you want to choose rust
18:04 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> do you know the name of it?
18:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no. I wouldn't have known deku either, though
18:05 < bridge_> <milkeeycat> sooner or later if i dont stop it i will have to rewrite in js
18:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> random result: https://github.com/jDataView/jDataView
18:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not sure if good

22:09 < bridge_> <Assa> My ubuntu server isn't able to connect to the outside world or to my router anymore (while the router still gave it an ip adress). SSH is working, but i can't ping 8.8.8.8. I can't think of anything anymore causing this, any ideas?
22:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what says `ip a`
22:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> or ip link
22:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dont leak ip tho
22:11 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> what about ip route
22:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well ip a wont show public
22:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think
22:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
22:11 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> everything pointed correctly?
22:12 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> or point it to the obvious:have you tried turning it off and on again? systemctl restart networking/service networking restart
22:13 < bridge_> <Assa> network is state UP
22:13 < bridge_> <Assa> I can't leak my ip this way, only local IPs
22:13 < bridge_> <Assa> (except maybe ipv6)
22:13 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> can you communicate with local devices?
22:13 < bridge_> <Assa> yes, i am on it with ssh
22:14 < bridge_> <Assa> (but I can't ping my router)
22:14 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> could be a problem with either default gateway or DNS res
22:14 < bridge_> <Assa> ping 8.8.8.8 shouldn't use DNS
22:15 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> oh right..
22:16 < bridge_> <Assa> default gateway is router, you can check it with `ip route`
22:16 < bridge_> <Assa> ```
22:16 < bridge_> <Assa> ip route                                                                                                                                                                                                                         default via 192.168.2.1 dev enp86s0 proto dhcp metric 20100      
22:16 < bridge_> <Assa> ```
22:17 < bridge_> <Assa> I restartet the router, the NetworkManager, the system itself, I really have no idea anymore
22:18 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> safely assuming that other connected devices function properly? maybe some kind of ip adress conflict?
22:18 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> very unlikely, but since you almost tried everything i would've, idk
22:18 < bridge_> <Assa> After backing it up I resetted even iptables
22:19 < bridge_> <Assa> Nope, it has a static ip address reserved for it
22:19 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> anything in syslog/messages? (/var/log/syslog - /var/log/messages
22:27 < bridge_> <Assa> nothing I could see easily, anything I should grep for?
22:27 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> the only thing i know out of the blue is enp86s0 for network interface events in syslog
22:27 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> "grep "enp86s0" /var/log/syslog
22:28 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> use your own network interface ofc (ip addr)
22:29 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> the only thing i know out of the blue is grep,ing your network interface in syslog
22:29 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> i should start wording things better before pressing enter
22:29 < bridge_> <Assa> it doesn't contain anything supsicious, only infos and some addr changes due to router restarts
22:30 < bridge_> <Assa> @ryozuki any ideas?
22:30 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> you can also grep for "dhcp" "route" "icmp" "firewall" and "network" just to make sure
22:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk
22:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> probs u messed up with dhcp
22:33 < bridge_> <Assa> networkd-dispatcher[826]: WARNING: systemd-networkd is not running, output will be incomplete. 
22:33 < bridge_> <Assa> Huh?
22:34 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 😄 "systemctl status systemd-networkd
22:34 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> 😄 "systemctl status/start/enable systemd-networkd
22:37 < bridge_> <Assa> okay I have an idea now what's wrong, wtf ...
22:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> keep us updated @essigautomat
22:45 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> !
22:45 < bridge_> <YADDB> Command not found!
22:45 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> :-:
22:46 < bridge_> <Assa> I had a few dead virtual networks and removed them now
22:46 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> why bot commands working outside bot-cmds 😮
22:46 < bridge_> <Assa> but I get the same error from docker and it didn't fix my issue
22:46 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> oh is it because of the git bot? - nvm then
22:47 < bridge_> <Assa> And now I am out of ideas again
22:47 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> your server is running in a docker?
22:48 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> your server is running in a docker? - if so you could check it with "docker network ls"
22:49 < bridge_> <Assa> the host machine has the issue, not the docker container
22:49 < bridge_> <Assa> so, the docker container has the issue too, but just by transitivity
22:50 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `ip route` please
22:51 < bridge_> <hus3h> could it be something with apparmor/selinux?
22:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> output of `ping 8.8.8.8` please, too, please @essigautomat
22:56 < bridge_> <Assa> 100% package loss, nothing to output
22:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `ip route` please
23:01 < bridge_> <Assa> I was already resetting ip rout rn:

23:01 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> try `ping 192.168.2.1`
23:02 < bridge_> <cyberFighter> is there a way to change the size of weapons on tees and change the spritesheet
23:03 < bridge_> <Assa> nope, nothing
23:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that sounds like your problem, you can't connect to your supposed router
23:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what's your local IP address?
23:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> did you obtain it from dhcp?
23:07 < bridge_> <Assa> how do I know if i got it from dhcp?
23:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> hmm. do you know what manages the network interface?
23:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> e.g. NetworkManager or systemd-networkd
23:07 < bridge_> <Assa> NetworkManager
23:08 < bridge_> <Assa> ```
23:08 < bridge_> <Assa> enp86s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
23:08 < bridge_> <Assa>     link/ether SOMEMAC brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
23:08 < bridge_> <Assa>     inet 192.168.2.162/24 brd 192.168.2.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enp86s0
23:08 < bridge_> <Assa> ```
23:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> do you have this NetworkManager symbol in the tray?
23:09 < bridge_> <Assa> I have the network-connected-symbol, if you mean that (happy not to run headless here)
23:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> can you edit the wired connection there by right-clicking?
23:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it might tell you something about whether dhcp is *supposed* to be active
23:11 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> isnt it safe to assume dhcp is working? "<BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP>
23:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> might be a statically assigned IP address, no?
23:12 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> could be.. noprefixroute
23:13 < bridge_> <hus3h> if I got that right, you can just resize each weapon with something like Gimp, scale in a way that keeps each weapon at the same center but smaller
23:13 < bridge_> <hus3h> I have 2 files from before that you can check
23:13 < bridge_> <hus3h> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1136044104514555995/game_06_compact.png

23:14 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> or just modify render.cpp
23:14 < bridge_> <blaiszephyr> if i understood his question with spritesheet correctly
23:21 < bridge_> <Assa> No Prefix Route: noprefixroute - Indicates that there is no specific route defined for this IP address; it will use the default gateway.
23:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I also have `noprefixroute` on my link
23:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> doesn't seem to be the problem
23:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> did you get anything from the NetworkManager settings?
23:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if not, could you try checking the NetworkManager logs?
23:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `journalctl -r NetworkManager`
23:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `journalctl -ru NetworkManager`
23:22 < bridge_> <Assa> NetworkManager[751]: <info>  [1690924335.6729] manager: NetworkManager state is now CONNECTED_GLOBAL
23:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm interested in messages related to dhcp
23:23 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> this didn't work or you didn't try?
23:24 < bridge_> <hus3h> if I got that right, you can just resize each weapon with something like Gimp, scale in a way that keeps each weapon at the same center but smaller
23:24 < bridge_> <hus3h> I have 2 files from before that you can check
23:24 < bridge_> <hus3h> (add the files to assets/game/ folder in your teeworlds/ddnet folder, then choose them in settings - assets - game)
23:30 < bridge_> <Assa> I got a warning there over 2 hours ago, restartet the service and everything seems fine
23:31 < bridge_> <Assa> got lease messages from dhcp4 and dhcp6
23:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `sudo iptables -L -n -v`

23:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > I'm doing this as a follow-on to my previous post on this topic, since this is a fast-changing story. To recap, preprints appeared last week making the remarkable claim of a well-above-room-temperature superconducting material at ambient pressure, dubbed LK-99. This is one of the most sought-after goals in all of materials science and condensed matter physics, something that until now has only been found in (numerous!) science fiction stories. T

23:40 < bridge_> <Assa> @heinrich5991 already did that
23:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the command lists the iptables, doesn't reset it
23:40 < bridge_> <Assa> yes, but the guide I used does
23:40 < bridge_> <Assa> -F flag
23:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and you don't want to list your empty iptables?
23:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @ryozuki the hype seems real indeed. can this give some concrete examples?

23:45 < bridge_> <Assa> that FORWARD line looks wwrong
23:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk rn
23:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> lets see how it goes xd
23:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ima go sleep now
23:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> good night 🙂
23:45 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u2
23:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but it also says 0 packets, so maybe it's not bad
23:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> can you tell me what the output of `curl -i http://1.1.1.1/` is?
23:47 < bridge_> <Assa> I am expecting a timeout
23:48 < bridge_> <Assa> so nothing
23:53 < bridge_> <reitw> @essigautomat what are you trying to fix
23:53 < bridge_> <reitw> forward table won't be reached if you just send or receive packets that won't be forwarded
23:53 < bridge_> <reitw> forward chain won't be reached if you just send or receive packets that won't be forwarded
23:55 < bridge_> <Assa> @reitw The internet on my server isn't working, while everything seems to be configured right and the network has internet and I can ssh into the machine
23:55 < bridge_> <reitw> so locally everything is fine but not outside
23:55 < bridge_> <reitw> did u try to ping ur router from ur server
23:56 < bridge_> <Assa> I can't tell where the issue is, everything looks like I should be able to connect to the internet with it, but I can't even ping 8.8.8.8
23:56 < bridge_> <Assa> yes I did
23:56 < bridge_> <reitw> do you have traceroute installed
23:56 < bridge_> <Assa> can't ping the router, but get an IP adress?
23:56 < bridge_> <reitw> ah
23:56 < bridge_> <reitw> what does ip a shows
23:56 < bridge_> <Assa> no, and I can't install it because I have no internet
23:56 < bridge_> <reitw> put the full output here
23:57 < bridge_> <reitw> ah u did above
23:57 < bridge_> <Assa> ip a shows my network being up, ip link shows my gateway, iptables is now empty/cleaned
23:58 < bridge_> <reitw> careful with iptables there's multiple tables
23:58 < bridge_> <reitw> but if you didn't touch anything should be empty
23:58 < bridge_> <Assa> no i had to reset it
23:58 < bridge_> <reitw> I meant
23:58 < bridge_> <reitw> raw, mangle, nat, etc..
23:59 < bridge_> <reitw> by default when you do `iptables -nL` you are looking at the filter table: `iptables -t filter -nL`
23:59 < bridge_> <reitw> each table has its use case, but I liked to use mangle table as it was "executed" before filter table, so packets were dropped before
