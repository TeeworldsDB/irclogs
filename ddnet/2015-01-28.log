19:08 < shahan> hello
19:08 < shahan> I have a question: does anybody knows if there is any version of teeworlds that is COMPLETELY mirated to SDL 2.0?
19:08 < Learath2> nothing complete shahan
19:08 < Learath2> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1246 swick got close but its not complete
19:09 <@EastByte> also there were some compatibility problems iirc
19:11 < shahan> actually, i've got macbook pro at work, and think about making a port to ios
19:11 < shahan> afaik SDL2 has native ios support
19:11 < shahan> so i guess teeworlds version with sdl 2 functions only should be easier to port to ios
19:13 < shahan> @Learath2, thx for the link, I'll look what i can do with it
19:13 <@EastByte> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/8403696
19:16 < shahan> @EastByte thank you again :)
19:16 < shahan> wow, deen works on sdl2 too

20:08 < CookieMichal> Hello
20:09 < CookieMichal> I have some problems when compiling ddnet :x Logs: http://paste.ee/p/ngiQa Can you please help me? :)
20:09 < CookieMichal> Is there some new stuff I should install? :x
20:14 <@deen> huh
20:15 <@deen> limits.h belongs to the standard c library, doesn't it?
20:15 < CookieMichal> no idea :p
20:15 <@deen> can you build vanilla TW 0.6?
20:16 <@deen> because vanilla includes the same limits.h
20:16 <@heinrich5991> deen: limit.h seems to be C
20:16 < CookieMichal> Haven't tested yet
20:16 <@deen> Maybe it's only C99?
20:18 <@deen> oh wait
20:18 <@deen> limits.h is not included in the old zlib version TW 0.6 usew
20:19 <@deen> uses*
20:19 < xRoThx> Hello
20:19 <@deen> and Visual Studio only has C89
20:19 < CookieMichal> 1>  AUTO  zlib                 not found, shouldn't it be different? :I
20:19 <@deen> while limits.h is C99
20:19 <@deen> that's bad
20:20 <@deen> i think the zlib message is ok
20:20 <@deen> it's just that you're the first to build new ddnet with visual studio?
20:20 < CookieMichal> yeah
20:21 < xRoThx> How are things going with ddnet? 
20:21 < CookieMichal> full logs, if that matters http://paste.ee/p/V8xhD
20:21 < xRoThx> I see there is again a GER2
20:21 <@deen> hm, this is bad
20:22 <@deen> wait, can't open stdio.h?
20:22 <@deen> stdio.h is C89 surely
20:22 < CookieMichal> :/
20:23 <@deen> anyone with visual studio can say if they have the same issue?
20:23 <@deen> CookieMichal: are you sure your visual studio installation is ok?
20:23 <@deen> CookieMichal: did you try compiling vanilla?
20:23 <@deen> (0.6.3)
20:23 < CookieMichal> not yet 
20:23 <@deen> try that please
20:23 < CookieMichal> okay
20:24 <@deen> i think it's your system
20:24 < CookieMichal> Win 10 [*]
20:24 <@deen> oh!
20:24 <@deen> but win10 should still have stdio.h and limits.h :P
20:24 <@deen> maybe the path to them is just wrong somehow
20:30 < eeeee> xRoThx: tl;dr kidz were buying 40gbit to ddos GER. attacks were for like only 5 minutes but GER hoster downed the server for 4 hours on occasion. we deployed GER2 to at least keep some presence in germany when that happens.
20:31 < xRoThx> Alright
20:32 < xRoThx> I heard they can't such big attacks.. Too bad, but there isn't really another option at this moment is there? 
20:34 <@deen> no idea
20:34 <@EastByte> at 40gbit/s ddos? be glad that nfoservers acts that kind and doesn't drop the vps completly
20:35 <@EastByte> even our ddos kids won't be able to keep such attacks up for a long time
20:35 <@EastByte> no need to worry
20:37 <@EastByte> btw. I caught Sushitee setting up an uptee environment on a nfoservers host: http://safe-t-server.com/
20:37 < xRoThx> Uhu?
20:37 <@EastByte> I think it wasn't online yesterday
20:37 < xRoThx> It wasn't 
20:38 < xRoThx> The project finally got some movement ^^
20:39 <@EastByte> http://uptee.eastbit.net/
20:39 <@EastByte> yea
20:39 < xRoThx> managed to set it up? 
20:39 < xRoThx> Or you got some help? 
20:40 <@EastByte> nah, a year ago I also was developing on uptee
20:41 < xRoThx> Alright
20:41 < xRoThx> Nice
20:41 < xRoThx> Its a nice project
20:41 < xRoThx> But is pretty difficult atm
20:41 <@EastByte> it's a big and complex project
20:41 < xRoThx> yes..
20:41 <@EastByte> and I think it has some performance flaws
20:42 < CookieMichal> deen: I think that there was something wrong with my include paths
20:42 < xRoThx> But Since I would only use it to sponsor some clans or players, offer testservers, and test it.. Doesn't really mather
20:42 < CookieMichal> deen: No idea why, but it builds now :)
20:43 < xRoThx> Should still find a coder that makes a custom & easy one :)
20:43 <@deen> CookieMichal: great!
20:57 < CookieMichal> My include variable was set to: INCLUDE=/src/engine/external/zlib/;/other/sdl/include/;/src/;
20:57 < CookieMichal> :>
22:15 < Learath2> deen: how can i identify a ddos ?
22:16 <@EastByte> check whether your provider informs you
22:16 <@EastByte> sniff some traffic (if possible) and analyse
22:16 <@EastByte> check traffic and cpu usage
