00:16 <+bridge> [00:06:16] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://status.tw/?p=charts
00:16 <+bridge> [00:06:23] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> vanilla devs dont get it
00:16 <+bridge> [00:06:29] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ddrace is THE wanted gametype
00:16 <+bridge> [00:06:46] [ddnet] <Learath2> I am at least 1e-35 of the dev team
00:16 <+bridge> [00:09:00] [ddnet] <Learath2> @RyO's
00:16 <+bridge> [00:09:22] [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki what would you want to do with a ui rewrite?
00:16 <+bridge> [00:09:37] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> less roundiness more flatness
00:16 <+bridge> [00:09:39] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mm
00:16 <+bridge> [00:09:42] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> some effects
00:16 <+bridge> [00:09:45] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ui 0.7 compatibility
00:16 <+bridge> [00:09:46] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> like any modern ui
00:16 <+bridge> [00:10:04] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not a designer but i can tell u tw ui is ugly
00:16 <+bridge> [00:10:16] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepeH:
00:16 <+bridge> [00:10:26] [ddnet] <Learath2> do people even like the 0.7 ui?
00:16 <+bridge> [00:10:32] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :no:
00:16 <+bridge> [00:10:37] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Big
00:16 <+bridge> [00:10:38] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the ui is rendered programatically right
00:16 <+bridge> [00:10:38] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :no:
00:16 <+bridge> [00:10:45] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why not make some 2k textures
00:16 <+bridge> [00:10:47] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
00:16 <+bridge> [00:10:51] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with modern programs
00:16 <+bridge> [00:10:53] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ programmatically
00:16 <+bridge> [00:10:54] [ddnet] <Learath2> they do have a couple pretty nice fixes to the ui code though, which we should take soon
00:16 <+bridge> [00:10:55] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> design programs
00:16 <+bridge> [00:11:13] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ik its hard due to res scaling
00:16 <+bridge> [00:11:17] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 2k textures sounds like teeworlds download will become 500MB instead of 10MB ðŸ˜›
00:16 <+bridge> [00:11:20] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
00:16 <+bridge> [00:12:06] [ddnet] <Learath2> why stop there? id software used 16k textures in rage
00:16 <+bridge> [00:12:36] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if they do it programatically or not but it has its shadows and depth
00:16 <+bridge> [00:12:37] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/559514935801937932/fff-212_gui-v2_train-schedule-mockup_02.png
00:16 <+bridge> [00:12:38] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> overall lot better
00:16 <+bridge> [00:12:53] [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought you wanted flat? ðŸ˜›
00:16 <+bridge> [00:12:56] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
00:16 <+bridge> [00:13:07] [ddnet] <Learath2> material design?
00:16 <+bridge> [00:13:09] [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im a mess
00:16 <+bridge> [00:13:13] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :yes:
00:16 <+bridge> [00:13:16] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> big
00:16 <+bridge> [00:13:17] [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :yes:
00:16 <+bridge> [00:14:07] [ddnet] <NeXus> +1 for material ui

09:36 <+c0d3d3v> Ryozuki off topic... but is this your base Ryozuki?
09:36 <+Ryozuki> c0d3d3v: wdym
09:37 <+Ryozuki> ah no
09:37 <+Ryozuki> its a pic from their awesome blog xD
09:37 <+c0d3d3v> xD ok ...
09:38 <+c0d3d3v> a lot of rails for so a tiny base :D 
09:39 <+Learath2> I wonder if airlines pay extra to get their websites as broken and shitty as possible
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @deen why not make the gores tab optional in the settings? Like a checkbox or something and maybe do the same for ddnet tab. Dunno if that is easy tho.
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and also make LAN and Favorites optional? ðŸ˜„
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hmm that isnt that bad indeed
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> that actually sounds good
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Not much people use lan or favorites. And if you say it is only possible to check 3boxes it isnt a Designing problem, because there are already 3 list (excluding global).
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Not much people use lan or favorites. And if you say it is only possible to check 3 of the boxes it isnt a Designing problem, because there are already 3 list (excluding global).
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> alot of people use favorites list especially if they have bad internet connection
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well it shouldnt matter if you make it optional @noby
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> how about adding skin tab where you can store multiple skins
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <eNJi> like ath identities tab, but only to store skins
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> :f3:
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> if u do that
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> i would come back on ddnet
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> i think
17:11 <+c0d3d3v> Gwendal Where are you if you're not on ddnet?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> another client than ddnet one
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> but i'm playing on ddnet servers xd
17:13 <+c0d3d3v> k
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @eNJi Just bind it
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have 1 key, that activates Numpad 0-9 and binds identities on it, if i click the key again, all are unbound again
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> how do i remove the tele numbers again to reduce lagg?
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> cl_text_entities 0
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yeees thx
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ^^
