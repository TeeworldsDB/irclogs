14:54 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> @Reteah
14:55 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> what about the first one Acik/Kapali?
14:57 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> open/close
14:58 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> what os are you using? if you are using linux can you run this in a terminal `ip a` it will print your machine's local ip eg 192.168.x.x
14:59 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> im using windows 7
14:59 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> Open/close
14:59 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> İ selected open
14:59 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> İ m using windows 7
15:00 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> open a terminal and type ipconfig
15:00 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> İ did it
15:01 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> what the output of IPv4 Address?
15:01 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> 198.168.1.33
15:01 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> 192.168.1.33
15:02 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> Did you press apply?
15:02 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> Yeah
15:02 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> More than 10 times
15:02 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> İ changed and try everything
15:02 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> xD just to be sure eh?
15:02 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> anyway I had a similar problem try on wan port setting 8303-8304
15:02 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> or 8302-8304 if that doesn't work idk
15:03 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> Just wan port
15:03 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> Or i change on lan port
15:03 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah you could try to use a different port
15:03 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> Okay
15:04 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> Not working
15:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Where does this picture come from?
15:05 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> From your router?
15:05 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> Ping.eu
15:05 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> Port-chk
15:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> It's possible your ISP doesnt allow to open ipv4 port
15:06 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> uh
15:06 < bridge_> <Learath2> Mh, unlikely
15:06 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i opend on windows security wal
15:06 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Pretty likely actually
15:06 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i opend on windows security wall
15:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Many ipv4 addresses are shared
15:07 < bridge_> <Learath2> More likely he can be behind a CGNAT if it’s turkey
15:07 < bridge_> <Learath2> Oh, that’s what you meant too
15:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> U can see if you have aipv6 option in your router that you can disable
15:07 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> where i see idk
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Idk either, I have it
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> And I required to disable it too
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> To get a proper ipv4
15:08 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i need disable aipv6
15:08 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> am i understand?
15:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Just ipv6 xd
15:08 < bridge_> <Learath2> Turkey doesn’t have ipv6
15:09 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> then
15:09 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i dont have any option
15:09 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i cant open
15:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> Ask your isp
15:09 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> what is isp
15:09 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> internet service provider
15:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> The ppl that give u internet
15:10 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> hmm
15:10 < bridge_> <Learath2> Wait, let’s make sure first
15:10 < bridge_> <Learath2> Your router configuration looks fine, your lan ip seems correct
15:10 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> yes
15:11 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> my windows security wall is okay
15:11 < bridge_> <Learath2> Is your ddnet server running?
15:11 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> yes
15:11 < bridge_> <Learath2> Can you dm me your public ip so I can try to connect?
15:11 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> ill try restart but still not have port
15:13 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> turkey have ipv6
15:13 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> since 2012
15:15 < bridge_> <Learath2> Hm, which isp even has ipv6? I only know of that one provider that uses cable tv coax lines that uses ipv6
15:15 < bridge_> <Learath2> Turknet or sth
15:15 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> superonline turkcell to
15:15 < bridge_> <Learath2> Ah, nice to see it getting more use
15:16 < bridge_> <Learath2> Anyway, if you dm your ip I can try connecting. Maybe it's the port checker site that's having an issue
15:17 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i sent my ip addres already
15:17 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> dm
15:18 < bridge_> <Learath2> And is the server running right now?
15:18 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> yes
15:18 < bridge_> <Learath2> Hm, is there a DMZ setting on your router?
15:18 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1067448359746539570/image.png
15:18 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> yes
15:18 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i changed open but still not working
15:19 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> ah lol you have it set on ipv6 mode I think
15:19 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> how i change mode
15:19 < bridge_> <Learath2> mh, teeworlds servers bind to both v4 and v6
15:20 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> am i need sent dmz menu
15:20 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> am i need sent dmz menu?
15:20 < bridge_> <Learath2> Yeah, it is a pretty simple menu usually but if you are not sure you did it correctly you can send it
15:21 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1067448996043427880/image.png
15:21 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> DMZ open/close
15:21 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> LAN admin 192.168.1.33
15:21 < bridge_> <Learath2> Yeah, that's correct
15:21 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> then what i need do
15:21 < bridge_> <Learath2> Ok, let's check if you are behind cgnat
15:21 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> what is cgnat
15:22 < bridge_> <Learath2> Is there a WAN section on your router?
15:22 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> yes
15:22 < bridge_> <Learath2> It means you share a public ipv4 address with many people
15:22 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> okayy
15:22 < bridge_> <Learath2> It should be showing you your ip address somewhere
15:23 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1067449543404310590/image.png
15:23 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> my WAN information
15:24 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> it deleted
15:24 < bridge_> <Learath2> I deleted it
15:24 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> send those info in DM
15:24 < bridge_> <Learath2> You had your public ip wrong
15:24 < bridge_> <Learath2> I connected to your server just fine
15:24 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> sorry
15:24 < bridge_> <Learath2> Use the ip at the very bottom
15:24 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> really
15:24 < bridge_> <Learath2> right above 255.255.255.255
15:25 < bridge_> <Learath2> I'm on the server right now
15:25 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> send those info in DM (not in mine but in general don't send it to public channels)
15:25 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> which ip i cannot find
15:27 < bridge_> <Learath2> Oh btw, disable DMZ
15:27 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> okay
15:27 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i have 1 more question
15:27 < bridge_> <Learath2> It's not exactly very safe to have all your ports exposed
15:27 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> peoples are see my server on ddnet
15:29 < bridge_> <Learath2> Mh, it doesn't look like it registered so I don't really see it
15:29 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> how i register
15:29 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> my server
15:30 < bridge_> <Learath2> Can you show me this screen? Are there any errors on it?
15:30 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> bad idea if you register people can DDoS you (shutdown your internet)
15:30 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1067451428626505728/image.png
15:31 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i dont thinl
15:31 < bridge_> <Learath2> You need to show earlier stuff, there should be something about "register"
15:31 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i dont think theres error
15:32 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1067451818306699315/image.png
15:33 < bridge_> <Learath2> Oh, actually we disabled registering by default
15:33 < bridge_> <Learath2> Do you know where the server config is? You just need to set `sv_register` to 1 in there
15:33 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> thanks i know
15:34 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> you are so good
15:34 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> have a good day
15:34 < bridge_> <Learath2> @heinrich5991 my server is registering just fine but I'm getting some errors on the console, why is that?
15:35 < bridge_> <Learath2> This seems a little excessive, no?
15:35 < bridge_> <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1067452536694505503/image.png
15:35 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> register it with ipv4
15:35 < bridge_> <Learath2> and it'll keep happening every couple minutes because I don't have v6
15:35 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> `sv_register ipv4` is what I changed to my server too for this reason
15:35 < bridge_> <Learath2> Maybe we should just disable v6 registering if we don't have a v6 addr? This computer doesn't even have a local v6 addr
15:36 < bridge_> <Learath2> It's not exactly a descriptive error either `libcurl error (7):` thanks
15:37 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> `sv_register ipv4` is what I changed it to my server too for this reason
15:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I guess we could squelch the error in this case
15:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but the IPv6 address might appear later
15:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> so maybe just ignore all errors that look like the last one?
15:47 < bridge_> <Learath2> Well stdout is async and register is async, so it might not be one after the other exactly sometimes
15:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah, I meant to talk about ignoring the errors within the register module
16:56 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> > squelch:  soft sucking sound made when pressure is applied to liquid or mud.
16:56 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> :justatest:
16:56 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> oh
16:56 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> > a circuit that suppresses the output of a radio receiver if the signal strength falls below a certain level.

18:19 < bridge_> <Simon'> https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.teewars.com*
18:19 < bridge_> <Simon'> this link directs to a list of all urls on the teewars web archive
18:20 < bridge_> <Simon'> the teewars 0.2.0 is working
18:20 < bridge_> <Simon'> didnt found any 0.1
18:20 < bridge_> <Simon'> is there a list of teewars versions on github?
18:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://downloads.teeworlds.com/
18:21 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> https://downloads.teeworlds.com/teewars/
18:23 < bridge_> <Simon'> ah
18:25 < bridge_> <Simon'> i dont really get what the fuck is the 1.0.0 version
18:27 < bridge_> <ReiTW> april  fool
18:28 < bridge_> <Simon'> ah well understandable
18:28 < bridge_> <Simon'> u can join ddnet servers with the 1.0.0 tho
18:28 < bridge_> <ReiTW> that's why it's in a "april" folder
18:29 < bridge_> <Simon'> how to start local server on 0.1.0?
18:31 < bridge_> <Simon'> the camouflage background is lit tho
18:40 < bridge_> <Simon'> why cannot i open maps from 0.1.0 in current ddnet version?
18:40 < bridge_> <Simon'> fil type is ddnet map file, same as in the current version
18:41 < bridge_> <Patiga> the content of the map files was different back them, but I only had a brief look at them once
18:42 < bridge_> <Simon'> can i open them in the 0.1.0 version?
18:42 < bridge_> <Patiga> that should be possible
18:42 < bridge_> <Simon'> how do i start local server on 0.1.0?
18:43 < bridge_> <Patiga> you would need the source files to compile it manually or the executables
18:43 < bridge_> <Patiga> https://downloads.teeworlds.com/teewars/ this list starts at version 0.2.3
18:45 < bridge_> <Simon'> im not a programmer but i guess it wouldnt work if i just copied the teewars.srv from another version into the 0.1.0 folder?
18:45 < bridge_> <Patiga> no
18:46 < bridge_> <Patiga> have you tried if you can open it in verison 0.2.3?
18:52 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> https://downloads.teeworlds.com/old_releases/
18:52 < bridge_> <Ryozuki> 0.1
18:52 < bridge_> <Simon'> yes it does
18:52 < bridge_> <Simon'> server also works on 0.2.0
18:54 < bridge_> <Simon'> there is also the 0.1.1 by heroi amerelo, but it only has the demo map
19:01 < bridge_> <Simon'> why do the snapshots on the web archive only work until march 21 2008? every snapshot catched later doesnt work
19:13 < bridge_> <Simon'> is there any teewars/teeworlds quakenet logs before 2014?
19:13 < bridge_> <Learath2> I probably have them somewhere
19:15 < bridge_> <Learath2> Oh actually no, I did lose a lot of logs when switching servers
19:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪> man i am lucky, randomly clicked an old log, directly found this goldy
19:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ✪>

19:17 < bridge_> <Simon'> any freenode logs?
19:21 < bridge_> <Simon'> wait we still using quakenet
19:21 < bridge_> <Simon'> wtf
19:21 < bridge_> <Simon'> like i go there and theres messages from chillerdragon there from a few hours ago
19:22 < bridge_> <Simon'> how many bridges are there leading to and from quakenet?
19:23 < bridge_> <Learath2> wym?
19:23 < bridge_> <Learath2> There is 1 I think doing dc <-> irc
19:24 < bridge_> <Simon'> ah yes i see
19:26 < bridge_> <Simon'> in thory it should be possible to download all the logs and then write a small programm that searches for a specific word in all of the logs am i right?
19:31 < bridge_> <Simon'> i only know some python but not how to set up a programm
19:32 < bridge_> <deen> I think `wget -m -p -np https://ddnet.org/irclogs/` should get you there
19:33 < bridge_> <Simon'> what is that?
19:34 < bridge_> <deen> a command for your terminal, I somehow assumed you're on Linux/macOS
19:34 < bridge_> <deen> on Windows not sure 😄
19:35 < bridge_> <Simon'> is there a way to download all the logs?
19:36 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> he just sent it to you xD
19:36 < bridge_> <Simon'> i use windows
19:36 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah install wget on windows and then run the cmd ig

21:59 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i have this error how can i fix it
22:00 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> server is running and my friends can come but not registered
22:00 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> can you help me @Learath2
22:01 < bridge_> <Learath2> it looks like it registered fine except for ipv6
22:01 < bridge_> <Learath2> which you don't have
22:01 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> and i see
22:01 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> in internet my server
22:01 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> search
22:02 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1067550007374393414/image.png
22:02 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i have in cmd ipv6
22:02 < bridge_> <KDaniel> fe80:: is local ipv6
22:03 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> no
22:03 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> its long
22:03 < bridge_> <Learath2> that's local ipv6 indeed
22:03 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i sansured
22:03 < bridge_> <Learath2> everything that starts with fe80 is local
22:03 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> then
22:03 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i cant
22:03 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> register
22:03 < bridge_> <Learath2> anyway, it's fine, ipv6 can fail
22:03 < bridge_> <KDaniel> you need something like this 
22:03 < bridge_> <KDaniel> ```
22:03 < bridge_> <KDaniel> IPv6-Adresse. . . . . . . . . . . : 2a00:
22:03 < bridge_> <KDaniel> ```
22:03 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> but i register 1 time
22:03 < bridge_> <Learath2> ipv4 seems to have registered fine
22:03 < bridge_> <KDaniel> fd00 and fe80 is like your local ip to your router
22:03 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> my friends see online my server on search
22:04 < bridge_> <Learath2> if your friends see it, then what is the problem?
22:04 < bridge_> <KDaniel> and what is the problem here?
22:04 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> how i make this
22:04 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> now cant see
22:04 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> and error like this
22:04 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> 2 hours ago its working
22:05 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> I don't know how I got it working before, how I broke it now
22:05 < bridge_> <KDaniel> configure your router to get a ipv6 ip address
22:05 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> how can conffigure
22:05 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> which setting
22:07 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> I will check if my modem supports ipv6.
22:08 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> woaw my modem have ipv6
22:08 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> but in forum its say i change some settings
22:08 < bridge_> <KDaniel> just google it like :"ipv6 public ip to pc over dhcp or slaac"
22:08 < bridge_> <Learath2> Stop messing around with ipv6, we don't even register the official servers with ipv6
22:08 < bridge_> <Learath2> it has nothing to do with ipv6
22:09 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> then what i need
22:09 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> ill stop messing around with ipv6
22:09 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> its can fix without this?
22:09 < bridge_> <KDaniel> sv_register ipv4
22:10 < bridge_> <Mr.Gh0s7> ^
