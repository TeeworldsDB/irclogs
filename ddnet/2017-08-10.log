03:16 <+Edible> latest update screwed up my controls
03:18 <+Edible> or maybe it was because i had the conf file open?
03:18 <+Edible> nah
03:21 <+Edible> im on windows 7, kb is english US - dvorak 
03:22 <+Edible> it thinks its qwerty
08:13 <@deen> Edible: Well, yeah. That was expected. We use scancodes instead of respecting keyboard layouts. So that means if you install DDNet with a new config, you will have the same controls everywhere

17:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Guys,  have you an idea what can cause a long establishing connection to the router via wire? I mean, after reboot computer or router, even when rebooting network card, it takes way too long (abaout 15-30minutes) to establish the connection between router and computer. Windows 10 here. Wireless works fine and also works fine with other computers
17:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> can't find answer :?
17:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> In safe mode, it works fine
17:58 <@deen> buggy driver, interfering programs
17:58 <@deen> disable everything, reenable until you notice what causes it
18:11 <@Learath2> bad cable
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I checked few cables
18:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and that cable works with another computer perfectly
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Disabled all programs from autostart, any changes :/
18:17 <@deen> Learath2: but it works in safe mode
18:18 <@Learath2> well i'd try taking a more radical approach
18:18 <@deen> @Savander: Then the driver, I think safe mode doesn't use drivers (some/all)
18:18 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I should disable driver?
18:18 <@Learath2> windows is a bug in and of itself, try are more sane OS or atleast revert to a sane version of windows
18:19 <@Learath2> try removing the driver and letting windows install the default one
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> No money for mac, ineed to use adobe products
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Okay, i'll try
18:20 <@Learath2> need is a strng choice of words
18:20 <@Learath2> s/words/word/
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I dont see alternatives a this momebt
18:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Maybe affinity designer
18:21 <@Learath2> there is only one i see no replacement to
18:21 <@Learath2> after effects would be hell to replace
18:22 <@Learath2> and i'd rather not use a computer then to use osx
18:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Okay, removed now restart
18:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Meh, nothing
18:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :/
19:17 <+grenadepro> hey deen 
19:18 <+grenadepro> i downloaded last ddnet source and i compiled it , somthing wrong with client.
19:19 <+grenadepro> it crashed on start up
19:37 <+grenadepro> debug version have no problem (tested)
19:49 <@deen> gdb, backtrace?
19:56 <+grenadepro> windows 32bit i have
19:57 <+grenadepro> i compiled last ddnet source as "CLIENT_RELEASE"
19:57 <+grenadepro> compile done
19:57 <@deen> you have a debugger?
19:57 <+grenadepro> but client crash on startup
19:58 <@deen> to check where the error happens?
19:58 <+grenadepro> no
19:58 <@deen> that would be the next step
19:58 <@deen> what's the last output?
19:58 <@deen> you can set a logfile in settings
19:58 <+grenadepro> yes
19:58 <+grenadepro> w8
20:01 <+grenadepro> crashed seems before save any log 
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> are you on windows?
20:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> oh, yes windows
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> try from cmd ddnet.exe > file.log > a.txt 2>&1
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> sorry
20:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ddnet.exe > a.txt 2>&1
20:04 <+grenadepro> i saved log from console maybe help https://pastebin.com/AnGjWAix
20:04 <+grenadepro> yes im on windows
20:04 <+grenadepro> ok
20:04 <@deen> nothing special in there
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> try my command, it will log errors as well
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because, simple stream
20:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> doesn't do that.
20:04 <@deen> compiling with visual studio?
20:05 <+grenadepro> yes
20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you tried with redireecting errors as well?
20:06 <+grenadepro> savander i did you said but output like this https://pastebin.com/AnGjWAix
20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> woah, no errors
20:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> o.o
20:07 <+grenadepro> did you test last ddnet source on windows 32 ?
20:07 <+grenadepro> running on windows-win32-ia32
20:08 <+grenadepro> i compiled it with "CLIENT_DEBUG" compiler done its work ok
20:11 <+grenadepro> cant debug it caz debug version of client work ok :S
20:11 <@Learath2> grenadepro: does the debug version work outside a debugger?
20:12 <+grenadepro> yes i run client(debug version) work ok
20:13 <@Learath2> well idk what else we enable with debug mode but there should be a way to get just debug symbols + release version
20:19 <@deen> CFLAGS=-g on *nix
20:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> should I have exectuable binaries after cmake ..
20:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
20:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> or i have to do something more? ðŸ˜„ Never used cmake
20:21 <@deen> cmake just generates build files
20:21 <@deen> on linux you then run "make -j40"
20:21 <@deen> on msvc you should get build files for visual studio
20:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, hm
20:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> okay
20:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> OK IM TRYING
20:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜„
20:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> WOAH, WORKING
20:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> news skill to CV,
20:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> can compile DDNet sources
20:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and very basic usage of MSBuild
20:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> new skill *
21:16 <@deen> (if the skill is something you can get in 30 min, maybe it's not worth listing in your cv; especially if it is "compiling ddnet")
21:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> psst. It was a joke
21:20 <+grenadepro> xD
21:20 <+grenadepro> make me happy with yours skill
21:21 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> thank you ðŸ˜„
21:25 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> "make -j40" is there a difference with make -j4 ?
21:32 <+grenadepro> ok , i downloaded 10.7.1 ddnet source and client crashed same
21:38 <@deen> Ryozuki: -j is the number of jobs (commands) to run simultaneously
21:45 <@deen> so if you cpu has 40 threads, -j40 will be faster
22:49 <+grenadepro_> how its possible ? i downloaded https://ddnet.tw/downloads/DDNet-10.7.1-win32.zip its work ok but i downloaded ddnet source from 10.7.1 and i compiled it and client crashed on start up
22:52 <+grenadepro_> maybe caz im using vs2010 ?
23:00 <@deen> yeah, maybe
23:00 <@deen> vs2010 should have a debugger
23:00 <@deen> start the client with debugger and show us the backtrace
23:10 <+grenadepro_> you can just attach program from proccess ( running program )
23:11 <+grenadepro_> my friend have same problem
23:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> without details, we can't do anything i guess :/
23:13 <+grenadepro_> maybe someone else install vs2010 and test it
23:17 <+grenadepro_> looooooooooooooooooool
23:17 <+grenadepro_> i found the problem :D
23:17 <+grenadepro_> omg
23:17 <+grenadepro_> hardcore rly
23:18 <+grenadepro_> no no
23:18 <+grenadepro_> i was wrong :(
23:18 <+grenadepro_> :@
23:19 <+grenadepro_> i am on fire :@
23:27 <+grenadepro_> hope you guys solve the problem , i will follow commits, thanks every one answered.
23:27 <+grenadepro_> good night
