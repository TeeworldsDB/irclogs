05:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> oooh suure @jao as soon as you have a good rank on a map, the skips are intended.
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kyosuke> @heinrich5991 in the ddnet client cant you propose to add hookfly dummy command ?
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> How should it work in Detail @Kyosuke
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ?
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kyosuke> It will Hook you when its activate for do a Hook fly idk how explain better... Ithink like when you change dummy Hook dummy Hook ...
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mokuz> So timed hook aimbot for dummy
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mokuz> Or manyally activated
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kyosuke> yea i think something like this
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well there are already hookfly bots in other clients, the only thing is you can cheat with it because you can make it hook you in other parts too were normally it would be hard, now you got 100% catch rate.
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kyosuke> ah xD k
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mokuz> Well not 100% catch rate, since it hooks directly at you, so if you're moving too fast, it might miss.
14:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mokuz> Also it would hold hook for only few seconds, so cheating parts wouldn't be efficient
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kyosuke> yea... k
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> im asking again, can we get the old tile renderer back? i see this is ugly again in map flux. the diagonals are so ugly and even more not straight diagonal since this renderer renders even worse ._.
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think anyone is shoving opengl3 down your throat. Just disable it?
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast until we figure out a workable solution
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> client crashed, latest ddnet rls, zooming out  too much
