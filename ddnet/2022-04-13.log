00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> (25) Switch for turret is broken on solo maps see: https://streamable.com/jux2rs 
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://ddnet.tw/maps/Increase-32-Your-32-Speed/
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> without sv_solo_server the switch works
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I tested it on 15.9.1 server, there it is broken too
01:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I tested it on 15.9.1 (and 16.0.3) server, there it is broken too
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> GUYS
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> Why when I add some nice features it give me error like delete_scalar or getownghost
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> I have absolutely not touched these functions in any way, but they continue to give me an error after starting the game or closing the game (both with alt + f4 and with the appropriate key)
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ?xd
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> What did you do? What features? Where do you get what type of errors exactly
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> Lol i love chillerdragon
08:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> I added very small, minimally invasive writing in the hud and inside an if, in the nameplate I added a function to show me the player's hitbox by drawing a quad, because I didn't know in which other classes I could have the exact position of the player, then I always added them that adds a dot next to the name of the ping color, in the players class it seems to me a spin bot that is only local and makes only the Sprite move, in the menus
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> I used the translator because it was a long text
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> then obviously the macros of the variables.h file to link the variables to the settings
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> Ddnet client not teeworld
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @everestkio try removing your changes and see if you still get the same error
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if yes, then problem with your build i guess. if not, then maybe youâ€˜re overwriting random memory. post source code if you want us to take a look
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Lots of bugs youâ€˜re finding. Is it used on some map? Maybe we should use heinrichâ€˜s libtw tool to scan if there are any maps that would be affected by fixing this
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't remember any map using switched shooter
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> Where can I post it?
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> maybe post it here?
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> If it's ok all right xd
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> github, gist and link it maybe
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> Okk
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> It is at least used on this map 
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://ddnet.tw/maps/Increase-32-Your-32-Speed/ 
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> at the start, the turret should be only active as soon you go through the green switches. It works without the server is solo.
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> The bug was found by @Deathman  I only investigated a little bit
12:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I can take a look at the tool, xD if it's not too complicated, I can do a scan.
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I think it affects all turrets on the map
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> basicly the map is not playable as intended ðŸ˜„ ^^ if we fix it we would have to delete all ranks
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> or all since the bug was introduced
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> these bugs were such a bitch to describe and they're so annoying lol
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> this bug was introduced in DDNet 12.5 2019-06-13
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> had to change the most recent issue to be more accurate
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> discord embed may or may not be accurate when viewing this channel
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also just found out a lot of the unexpected behavior is worse than i thought gg
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> shift clicking stuff and X/Y shifting multiple times causes the distance between the layers to jump even more
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What is an X/Y shift @lynn?
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Could you maybe record a webm of this behaviour? It'd be easier to understand what's broken
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> You know the Shift X option for layers?
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> moving em around?
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that does not play nicely with multiply selected layers at all
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that does not play nicely with multiple selected layers at all
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it may or may not be Shift X/Y specific but worth testing other stuff, like resizing
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Multiple selections just don't work well at all ðŸ˜¦
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im curious about the first bug though, is it even a bug at all? or were we never intended to be able to select multiple groups at once
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's either that or just, old selection becomes uncolored as i mentioned
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @deen https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/fbf5edfdcbca8810471c0689339066702f879a0c this is the commit that introduced the bug xD I do not even know why this changes the physics of switches, very strange
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I tested it in latest master without this line the turrets work correctly
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I tested it in latest master, without this line the turrets work correct, I will look if I find out what goes wrong
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> PLEASE
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ðŸ¥°
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> I'm surprised no one noticed before :o I wonder if many maps use the opposite mechanic (as in switchable plasma gun that still affect you in solo), but I guess that is likely
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> In team maps*
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> do we have solo switches in team? so if you switch something in solo it does only affect your switch?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> since the reach of plasma turrets is normaly only ~22blocks, I do not think many maps used turrets for solo and team
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, in solo servers every player is in a separate team
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I mean on team servers of cause xD
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I mean on team servers of course xD
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> switches are per team, if that helps
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> so we do not have
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> k
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @heinrich5991  could you help me using libtw xD Its full of undocumented tools. I do not know where to start to find solo maps using turrets with switches
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> could we maybe deactivate default registration on master server (without me setting up a config xD), as it was on older servers? for debugging its annoying to get the terminal full of useless messages.
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> draggers seems to work correct btw
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sv_register 0
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u can start the server wirh arguments
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh sounds like a compromise
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I find it cool that you started working actively on DDNet btw
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4980/commits/65b7380023f37210ef55b35b1dd4b6b2530214a6 I changed that turrets will fire to the closest player in team, and ignore solo players. But the same mechanic is also build in draggers, seems I should revert it, because it is a game mechanic that it draggs the solo team mate if he is closer
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh but I do not think this will affect any map
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe it will
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> theoretically, according to the old code, you should always get the double charge when you are in the team solo, once as a normal team member as the closest player and once as a solo player xD lol
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <everestkio> https://www.filemail.com/d/nmvirlpcxnsnvga
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah ne i made a mistake if(IdInTeam[i] != -1) would prevent the double charge
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah no i made a mistake if(IdInTeam[i] != -1) would prevent the double charge
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> i am confused xd one moment
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah if (IdInTeam[Target->Team()] != i) would prevent the double charge
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> man, use github or any other git hoster
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4980/commits/65b7380023f37210ef55b35b1dd4b6b2530214a6 I changed that turrets will fire to the closest player in team, and ignore solo players. But the same mechanic is also build in draggers, seems I should revert it, because it is a game mechanic that it draggs only the solo team mate if he is closer, instead of both (solo would get dragged anyway)
