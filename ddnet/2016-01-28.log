00:23 < Hamid_Jigool> hi my friends
00:26 < Hamid_Jigool> anybody know how can i send broadcast on my all DDnet Servers for Tournaments? like real DDnet.. send broadcast evry 3 min by php scripts or anything
00:26 < Hamid_Jigool> anobody can help me?/
00:35 <@heinrich5991> I don't know how
00:35 <@heinrich5991> why do you want to spam your players? :/
00:36 < Hamid_Jigool> for tournoment i want send broadcast evry 15 min like this: "Tournament on Friday 20:34 PM on this server"
00:37 < Hamid_Jigool> you know?
00:48 <+o_be_one> heinrich5991: ddnet did this by fifo
00:48 <+o_be_one> sv_input_fifo "servers/8308.fifo"
00:48 <+o_be_one> when you add a command in fifo, the server execute it immediately
00:49 <+o_be_one> all is here : https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/tree/master/servers
00:50 <+o_be_one> its with the help of ddnet github that i was able to enhance a lot my TW servers
00:50 <+o_be_one> thank you ddnet, btw :)
00:51 <@heinrich5991> if you merged that fifo code, you might have merged thread unsafeties
00:51 <+o_be_one> ive merged nothing
00:51 <+o_be_one> i've just studed how DDNet works
00:51 <+o_be_one> and did something like ddnet
00:53 <+o_be_one> just my start script is better x)
00:54 <@heinrich5991> =)
00:55 <+o_be_one> well i've to go
00:55 <+o_be_one> see ya
00:55 <+o_be_one> oh btw EastByte deen yes now my serv is seen as down ... Thats really weird
01:02 <@heinrich5991> see ya
14:48 < Hamid_Jigool> hi my friends :D
14:49 < Hamid_Jigool> how can i send a broadcast on all my DDnet Servers? example for Tournament? any script is for that?
14:52 <+o_be_one> helo Hamid_Jigool 
14:52 <+o_be_one> about your request yesterday on how to announce tournament, use fifo
14:52 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: hi my friend :D
14:53 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: oo im time out last night .. sorry
14:53 <+o_be_one> look at this file : https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/servers/8306.cfg
14:53 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: whats is fifo? can you give me a website for learn it?
14:53 <+o_be_one> its a config file from DDNet official servers
14:53 <+o_be_one> you see the line sv_input_fifo ?
14:53 <+o_be_one> use this, when youll write something in this file, it will be sent to the server
14:54 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: ow.. i dont know before
14:54 <+o_be_one> yes its included in ddnet dont worry its easy
14:54 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: ok let me test.. im back in 2 min later :P
14:54 <+o_be_one> you'll have to write in your .fifo : broadcast Hello tournament in 5 min
14:54 <+o_be_one> and it will be sent to the server
14:54 <+o_be_one> easy
14:55 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: can you show me an example fifo file? i wanna see what is in
14:56 <+o_be_one> theres nothing in
14:56 <+o_be_one> when you write something, it will be deleted after its sent to the server
14:56 <+o_be_one> SO, if you write in the fifo file : broadcast HELLO !
14:57 <+o_be_one> it will send the broadcast to the server and erase the broadcast line from fifo file
14:57 <+o_be_one> you understand ?
14:58 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one:  how can i set that send evry 5 min?
14:58 < Hamid_Jigool> i mean how to set time?
14:59 <+o_be_one> learn more about crontab :)
14:59 <+o_be_one> in linux
14:59 < Hamid_Jigool> ow 
14:59 < Hamid_Jigool> i see
14:59 < Hamid_Jigool> yeessss
14:59 < Hamid_Jigool> thank
14:59 < Hamid_Jigool> :D
15:07 <+o_be_one> np
15:10 <+o_be_one> if you dont know how to bash, you can just prepare a fifo file in other folder and do a cron job to copy the fil where it has to be
15:11 < Hamid_Jigool> fifo file must be in DDnet Folder... is that true?
15:11 <@deen> o_be_one: i don't think that's how fifos work
15:12 <@deen> Hamid_Jigool: don't create the fifo file manually. in your config write "sv_input_fifo server.fifo" and then when you start the server a server.fifo will be created, you should see it
15:12 <@deen> then on the command line you can write "echo broadcast Hello > server.fifo" and the server should broadcast it
15:13 <+o_be_one> deen: thank you for the correction
15:13 < Hamid_Jigool> deen: then i creat a crontab for it?
15:13 <+o_be_one> yes Hamid_Jigool you can do a cronjob for this
15:13 <+o_be_one> to run each time you need to broadcast
15:14 < Hamid_Jigool> i see that.. thanks all
15:14 < Hamid_Jigool> i must run DDnet server in intranet for iranian people
15:15 < Hamid_Jigool> when we run real ddnet on internet our server fucked by DDos
15:15 <+o_be_one> with VPN Oo
15:15 <+o_be_one> ?
15:15 < Hamid_Jigool> you know what is intranet?
15:16 <+o_be_one> and you ?
15:16 < Hamid_Jigool> intranet is an internet that just people in that country can connect to it
15:16 <+o_be_one> how you'll let connect other people to your intranet ?
15:16 <+o_be_one> not really but anyway, how you'll do the job ?
15:16 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: intranet is an internet that just people in that country can connect to it
15:17 <+o_be_one> no this not define an intranet
15:17 <+o_be_one> so i understand that you'll just whitelist ip range from iran ?
15:17 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: this mean other strong NET just Chine internet or USA Net that can DDos us cant connect to us
15:18 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: exactly.. yes... whitelist 
15:18 <+o_be_one> and how you can think that it will work ? It's not cause you blacklist you are protected against ddos you know ?
15:18 <+o_be_one> if you want be protected to the internet, cause the ddos can attak your filter system
15:19 <+o_be_one> so the problem will be the same, you'll need network bandwith to handle it
15:19 <+o_be_one> but i assume that if no one see the server, how they'll get the ip, sure
15:20 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: in my country all DDos by foreign ips so when other server cant connect to it , it will be safe... now my server is run.. but you cant connect to my server because your ip is not for iran
15:20 <+o_be_one> i can get an iran ip :D
15:21 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: if you can,,, you can connect to my server ip: 10.201.120.213:8303
15:21 < Hamid_Jigool> its my Brutal server ip
15:21 <+o_be_one> now we have the ip, we can ddos it .. gg
15:22 < Hamid_Jigool> no you cant... intranet ips cant be DDosed by any people :D
15:22 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: you can test :P
15:22 <+o_be_one> i can't test, i've never spent time to learn ways to ddos
15:22 <+o_be_one> i'm more like protecting against ddos
15:23 <+o_be_one> anyway, you can get ddos
15:23 <+o_be_one> Hamid_Jigool: how you did the whitelist, tell me
15:23 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: i'm too... but actually there is no way to protect 100% against DDos
15:24 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: in my country you can buy safe intranet servers... i do not any thing to creat that :D
15:25 <+o_be_one> interesting, can you tell me more ? like a website where you can ask it ?
15:25 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: so all my people can play DDnet without any fucking russen or chines people or anybody that want to fuck us :D
15:25 <+o_be_one> i see that the ip is owned by USA 
15:26 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: its better than we have internet international server and anyone can fuck us :D
15:26 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: what ip? 10.201.120.213?
15:26 <+o_be_one> yes
15:27 <+o_be_one> can i connect if i have an ip from turkey ?
15:27 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: you can not whois interanet ips... 10.201.120.213 in evry country is possible...Germany USA Chine
15:27 < Hamid_Jigool> evry country have 10.X.X.X servers
15:27 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: no just can connect by iran :D
15:28 < Hamid_Jigool> i can give you a VPN to connect us.
15:28 < Hamid_Jigool> are you want?
15:28 <+o_be_one> you can whois but yes, its wrote as intranet ip
15:28 <+o_be_one> no thank you i was just curious
15:29 <+o_be_one> its like the china intranet x)
15:30 < Hamid_Jigool> what is mean curios?
15:30 < Hamid_Jigool> :S
15:30 <+o_be_one> hum here it means that i wanted to understand how it works
15:32 <@deen> o_be_one: 10.*.*.* are LAN ips, like 192.168.*.*
15:32 <+o_be_one> are you sure that all iran people will be able to connect ?
15:32 <+o_be_one> deen: yes that what i was thinking
15:32 < Hamid_Jigool> Germany have 10.201.120.213 -->> just German People can conect to it |||| Iran have 10.201.120.213 -->> just iranan people can connect to it ||| USA have 10.201.120.213 -->> just American people can conect to it
15:32 <@deen> o_be_one: and iran actually runs their own internal internet, to which only iranians can connect on these ips
15:32 <@deen> Hamid_Jigool: no, germany doesn't have that. only iran has that^^
15:32 <+o_be_one> oh ok thats cool
15:33 <@deen> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_intranet
15:33 < Hamid_Jigool> deen: German have that my dear... but used just by army
15:33 <@deen> "In April 2011, a senior Iranian official, Ali Agha-Mohammadi announced government plans to launch its own "halal internet", which would conform to Islamic values and provide "appropriate" services.[2] Creating such a network, similar to the North Korean example, would prevent unwanted information from outside of Iran getting into the closed system.[1] The Iranian walled garden would have its own localized ema
15:33 <@deen> il service and search engine.[3]"
15:33 <+o_be_one> i was expecting that only China use that x)
15:33 <@deen> Hamid_Jigool: sure, every company and also the military have a local network
15:33 <+o_be_one> halal internet omg, without porn ? :(
15:34 <+o_be_one> but so you dont need to have a vpn ? your modem will handle it ?
15:34 < Hamid_Jigool> deen: in iran other people can use it... military and etc :D
15:35 <@deen> o_be_one: i think it's best to imagine the whole country as a big LAN party :P
15:35 <+o_be_one> ahah
15:35 <+o_be_one> net send x)
15:35 < Hamid_Jigool> o_be_one: its fucking sheet halal.. fucking moslems :)) ... ii live in fucking place.. but i must create DDnet server for my people... you know?
