00:16 <@deen> great, today I learned that nim-lang.org and ddnet.tw are both blocked by some porn filters...
00:18 <@heinrich5991> ...
00:18 <@deen> "You can still turn off the filter. Bring your passport or another form of ID to your nearest Three store.
00:18 <@deen> "
00:19 <@deen> Oh great...
00:19 < Savander> whaat?:o
00:21 < eeeee> lol
00:22 < eeeee> those "Three" people have weird fetishes
00:22 < Muttley> xD
00:22 < Muttley> good that it's filtered
00:22 < Muttley> that strange teeworlds porn on ddnet ;-)
00:23 < eeeee> and while nim is kinda a sexy lang, it's not even THAT great
00:24 <@deen> eeeee: why not?
00:24 < eeeee> no adoption
00:25 <@deen> but in Nim you don't depend on adoption as much as in other languages, as you can use C libraries pretty easily
00:36 <@deen> but you're right, that's what caused my main problem with Nim: You find bugs everwhere^^
00:40 <@deen> but luckily most of the bugs I found have been fixed already, so that's good
01:40 < Nimda> Website went down!
01:40 < Nimda> Website went back online!
02:38 < eeeee> take bam for example, it's probably pretty legit build system but it has no adoption as well
02:38 < eeeee> that means no support and no docs
02:38 < eeeee> and i find it to be a huge PITA when you try to do something non-trivial like cross compiling
02:49 <@deen> true
02:49 <@deen> Wow, Chile 180 players, don't think I've seen that many before
02:49 <@deen> ah, we're the only server that's up in chile...
02:50 <@deen> need to run a few more servers, they're all full
02:50 <@deen> *not empty
07:28 < Maple> sigh
07:30 < Maple> so many skips in mojojump
08:16 < seymour> deen: ?
12:20 <@deen> seymour: 
12:20 < seymour> hi
12:21 < seymour> ok i got this great idea for ddnet.tw, you've probably thought of it already, but
12:21 < seymour> there should be a section where people can upload their demos which are made publicly available for others to download
12:22 < seymour> so pros like nealson can upload all his demos and i can watch them <3
12:22 <@deen> hi
12:22 < laxa> deen: new video
12:22 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/halloffame
12:22 < laxa> chiseled Cireme milk 10:16.86 qLZk775HxiA
12:23 < seymour> but like, for example, i wanna watch nealson's Aim 6.0 demo
12:23 < seymour> but its gonna take forever to get a video on the hall of fame :<
12:23 <@deen> laxa: thanks, updated
12:23 <@deen> seymour: yeah, we tried to find solutions for this but nothing really worked
12:27 < seymour> What about something simple like a "demo dumpster" where anyone can upload a .demo file, the server extracts the mapname, player name etc. and then a user can sort through them by date, player name, map etc.
12:27 < seymour> you give me ftp access, db user/pass and i'll make it happen
12:35 <@EastByte> with curl included we could implement all kind of demo upload/download viewing into the client
12:43 < seymour> or make the server record and auto-upload all finishes!! <3
12:45 <@EastByte> we already had this in discussion
12:46 <@EastByte> I guess most players wouldn't even want their demos to be uploaded automatically
12:47 < seymour> ah but they could just trun that off in the settings
12:47 < seymour> *turn
12:48 < seymour> i say we do the demo dumpster, see how that goes, then take it from there
13:00 <@deen> we have working auto-recordings
13:00 <@deen> on server, but they take too many resources
13:00 <@deen> I can already imagine how people will want me to remove some demos in which they say stupid stuff, play with the wrong people

19:55 < Savander> ffs
20:00 <@deen> Savander: yes?
20:02 < Savander> email servers is shit :c, Don't know how to install and configurate.. MEH:< I did something with postfix and i made dns records (mx and spf) but email are send to spam..
20:02 < Savander> i'm shit as hell :< I never did. 
20:02 < Savander> meh :P
20:26 < seymour> missing email headers maybe?
20:27 < Savander> don't know
20:27 < Savander> i send it wia
20:27 < Savander> via
20:27 < Savander> ssh: mail
20:27 < Savander> and second problem
20:27 < Savander> or nevermind..
20:27 < Savander> ;/
20:27 < Savander> fuck this shit
20:27 < Savander> i don't understand
20:27 < seymour> is it the gmail spam filter?
20:27 < Savander> how email works.....
20:28 < Savander> ye
20:30 < seymour> its probably the email headers. for example if the from header doesn't point to a valid domain, etc
20:30 <@deen> yeah, setting up a mail server is way too complicated
20:30 < Savander> i need it to my application 
20:30 < Savander> ;/
20:30 < seymour> just google gmail spam filter header requirements and set the headers before sending the mail
20:31 < Savander> btw. what should i install?
20:31 < Savander> i found something like that..
20:31 < Savander> http://www.debianadmin.com/debian-mail-server-setup-with-postfix-dovecot-sasl-squirrel-mail.html
20:31 < Savander> meh, first time with mail server 
20:31 < Savander> what the hell is dovecot?
20:31 < Savander> xD
20:35 < seymour> haven't used it before but it looks like you'd use it to receive emails on your server
20:42 < Savander> nice
20:42 < Savander> http://pastebin.com/8vxYS6ka
20:42 < Savander> i have a trouble with vps, mhm 
20:43 <@deen> Maz?
20:44 < Savander> max*
20:44 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
20:44 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 585
20:44 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 711 users online at 2014-12-21 20:13:02
20:44 < Savander> It was in polish
20:44 < Savander> (windows 7 polish)
20:44 < Savander> :P
20:56 < Muttley> Savander: i dont know the earlier conversation but i always use http://www.mail-tester.com/ it gives good insight on what might be wrong with your email format
20:56 < Savander> oh, okay thanks
20:57 < Learath2> Savander: if you need help with a mailserver setup i can help you 
20:58 < Muttley> http://pastebin.com/dxPp67XX
20:58 < Savander> maybe, but at this moment..
20:58 < Savander> i have troube with vps
20:58 < Muttley> i see loss to your vps to
20:58 < Savander> yup
20:58 < Savander> don't know why ;/
20:58 < Muttley> provider issue i guess icmp drops earlier on the path
21:02 < Savander> Yes, i will do anything later. Ohm, mail server.. :p.
21:03 < Muttley> Savander: what is going wrong with the email ?
21:03 < Muttley> bounce or.... ?
21:11 < Savander> Generally i don't know how to configure it. I based only on tutorials e.g. this http://www.debianadmin.com/debian-mail-server-setup-with-postfix-dovecot-sasl-squirrel-mail.html  I have only postfix and dovecot but I didn't change anything in configuration.  After installing postfix  (and after adding MX to dns http://www.savander.pl/img/Hgu7MHlB8523) i sent email to my gmail.com (via mail command) and it was in spam. I don't know how to receive email too :P
21:25 < Muttley> xD
21:26 < Muttley> in gmail you have the possibility to view the message source
21:26 < Muttley> could you paste that to pastebin ? headers only 
21:27 < Savander> ok
21:27 < Muttley> should be something like show original
21:27 < Savander> this?
21:27 < Savander> http://pastebin.com/qDHSXxQY
21:28 < Muttley> yes
21:28 < Muttley> your vps has ipv6
21:28 < Savander> ipv6 and ipv4
21:28 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
21:28 < Muttley> yes
21:28 < Muttley> does your mx record contains ipv6 ?
21:29 < Savander> em nope
21:29 < Muttley> then spf is no good ;-)
21:29 < Savander> ahm :o?
21:29 < Muttley> you know what spf is ?
21:29 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
21:29 < Savander> not rly, it allow you to send emails or something
21:30 < Muttley> it is an extra check to verify if an email is send from the right server
21:31 < Muttley> currently your spf doesnt match if a email is send by ipv6
21:31 < Savander> oh
21:31 < Savander> so what i should do? add ipv6
21:31 < Savander> ?
21:31 < Muttley> yes, add it to your mx record or add the ipv6 adress to the spf and txt record
21:31 < Savander> i found somewhere something like ipv4 and ipv6 in spf
21:31 < Savander> it's possible in cloudflare?
21:34 < Muttley> "v=spf1 ip6:2001:41d0:52:d00::540 +a  +mx -all"
21:34 < Muttley> this should do the trick
21:34 < Muttley> or just add this ipv6 address to the AAAA record of mail.ddforce.net
21:34 < Savander> in txt and spf ye?
21:34 < Muttley> yes
21:36 < Muttley> and if you want to recieve mail and use imap you need a imap server such as dovecot
21:37 < Muttley> the recieving part can be handled by gmail or postfx
21:37 < Muttley> i see you have dovecot installed
21:37 < Savander> yes
21:38 < Muttley> you want to use system users as mail users ? or database driven ?
21:38 < Savander> not rly
21:38 < Savander> only two accounts
21:38 < Savander> noreplay
21:38 < Muttley> ok
21:38 < Savander> norply
21:38 < Muttley> that shouldnt be a mailbox right
21:38 < Muttley> ;-)
21:38 < Savander> and administrator
21:39 < Savander> and contact*
21:39 < Savander> i need mailbox or something like 
21:39 < Muttley> ok, i think you can just add a user on the system and that should do the trick
21:39 < Savander> if someone sent email to contact@ddforce.net then it will be on 
21:39 < Savander> my gmail
21:40 < Muttley>    mydestination = $myhostname localhost.$mydomain ... example.com
21:40 < Muttley> there you need to add the domain name you want to recieve email for
21:40 < Muttley> in /etc/postfix.conf 
21:40 < Muttley> or /etc/postfix/main.cf
21:41 < Muttley> something like that
21:41 < Muttley> been a while since i configured postfix
21:41 < Muttley> ;-)
21:43 < Savander> then i don't need dovecot
21:43 < Savander> ye?
21:50 < Muttley> if you dont want to use pop3 or imap you dont need it
21:50 < Savander> don't know, if i can send emails from ddforce to gmail
21:50 < Savander> automatically
21:50 < Savander> then i don't need it
22:00 < Muttley> you can forward emails if you want
22:01 < Muttley> there should be a line in the postfix configuration like this
22:01 < Muttley> virtual_alias_maps
22:01 < Muttley> wich points to a file
22:02 < Muttley> contact@ddforce.com savander@gmail.com
22:02 < Muttley> this should make a mapping
22:02 < Muttley> simply restart postifx (maybe not needed) and you're done
22:03 < Savander> oh, okay, thanks ;)
22:03 < Savander> i'll try later because
22:03 < Savander> now 
22:03 < Savander> my vps is down wow
22:09 < Savander> OH wow
22:09 < Savander> vps works !
22:09 < Savander> perfectly !
22:22 < Savander> ok i found
22:22 < Savander> something
