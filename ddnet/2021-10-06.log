00:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I take the laptop I have to take my ugly bag :/
00:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> well depends where u going and how long
00:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> sweden, a week
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> who u going with
00:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> flipping a coin and realizing how much you dislike the outcome is more useful for decision making than the actual result of the flip
00:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> if u going with ur gf, then no. if u going with mates, then no, if u going to see family, then yes. if u going by urself then go to the club instead
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> what is this gf thing you are talking about? ðŸ˜›
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> unless you do this which i approve @Learath2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lNaATnghJE
00:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Going to visit a friend
00:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> lmao
00:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> u get work and pleasure in one! easy solution
00:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me try
00:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> you know what, I'll take it, just incase ddnet decides to blow up while I'm away
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> Sounds like we need a DR scenario when @Learath2 not here
00:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <SPYRES> If you give me the password, I'll keep it safe ðŸ˜‰
01:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @murpi still awake and can review? ^
01:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah @louis, maybe you're from a better time zone and can proofread this? ^
02:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> hi
02:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> ```On Thursday, September 30 DDNet reached its ten millionth finish. It was by [MaKaBaKa](https://ddnet.tw/players/MaKaBaKa/) on the map [Cool](https://ddnet.tw/maps/Cool/) on 2021-09-30 14:26:48 UTC+2.```
02:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> add a comma after 30 i think
02:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> maybe change `on 2021-09-30 14:26:48 UTC+2.` to `at 14:26:48 UTC+2.` since you already mentioned the date
02:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> everything else is good imo
02:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> @heinrich5991
02:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks ðŸ™‚
08:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its hacktoberfest
08:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/
09:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <jao> finally
11:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> cool \o/

12:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Skeith> wild
12:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> use a password manager and randomly generated passwords!
12:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> that's crazy
13:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> That's the Price for allowing hot tub and hypersexual content :feelspepoman:
13:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> That's the Price for allowing hot tub and hypersexual content :feelspepoman:, killing the platform
13:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://keepassxc.org/
14:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> bitwarden
14:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is what makes money :)
14:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I migrated to bitwarden when lastpass went full capitalist. Fairly happy with it
14:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> notebook irl
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @gerdoe u cant copy paste lengthy passwords that way
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> use 1234
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <uwu> :monkalaugh:
15:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i switched to keepassxc
15:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wasnt using any password manager xd
15:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> now im using 60+ length passwords :monkalaugh:
15:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Skeith> :justatest:
15:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Boti.> the big brain thing to do is using password the letter on your keyboard like qwertyuiop etc
16:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki I'm using bitwarden
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Since I started using bitwarden I've been shocked by how many sites forbid long password or special characters in passwords
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> At least they don't just remove those chars and shorten the pw without warning you, my bank used to do that ðŸ˜„
16:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> agreed
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a 22 character alphanumeric password gives you 128 bit security, which is enough
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Sure, but if you do anything other than hashing a pw you're probably doing something wrong
16:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and for hashing special chars and length don't matter much
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> md5 uses 128 bit and there's nothing wrong with md5 :monkaS:
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> length yes (outside of protection against DoS by really long passwords >1kb), special chars might be a customer help issue when people try to type their passwords on different keyboards
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hitler was vegetarian
16:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cipy29> could've been worse
16:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Max upload size is limited in PHP by default.
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @FÃ¤n django had a DoS vulnerability with password length. max upload size sounds like something in the range of >10mb, so maybe that wouldn't help with intentionally slow password hashing algorithms
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> PHP usually instantly dies if max upload size is hit
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> (>2Mb by default iirc)
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > By default, the maximum upload file size for PHP scripts is set to 128 megabytes.
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> It's set to 2MB with Plesk.
16:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> django restricted password length to 4KB following the DoS vulnerability
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like the max upload size wouldn't really help in that case
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (also, django is a python framework, not php)
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I don't know django at all
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> so makes sense
16:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> We use Laravel for anything custom
16:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im not gonna remember a 22 char pw so why not just use a 60 char one
16:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I see no advantage of a 60 character password over a 22 character password
16:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> a little advantage of shorter passwords, an advantage that I used before, is: you can copy them more easily by typing them (into a not-fully-trusted computer)
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> some services can't keep 60 length password kekw
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> none that i use cant
16:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also i dont share passwords so i would just use a shorter for that
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I saw you typing!
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜›
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> oh ma gawd
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Keep forgetting this is a thing in europe... ofc there is free wifi, even in busses
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in europe as opposed to?
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Turkey
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Free wifi is non-existant there. Even in places where it exists its like dialup speeds
17:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Its everywhere in italy too but italy also decided 1mbps is enough
18:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think there is free wifi here in barcelona too
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk for sure i have 50gb data i never use :monkalaugh:
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so many prs
18:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when next version
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/15.5.4...master
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its already double size
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> double commit size*
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> than this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/compare/15.4...15.5.4
18:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 433 vs 210 :poggers:
18:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `"address":"tw-0.6+udp://connecting-address.invalid:8303"`
18:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is that too overkill? allows the server to specify the connection URL with only the IP address missing, because it might not know its own IP address
18:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (for the register API)
18:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> alternative would be something like "port":"8303", would make it harder to add query parameters etc. though
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `"port":8303`, I mean
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> huge release, epic
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 @Ryozuki you sure have an opiion on the above?
18:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why make address be so cluttered, maybe just put "twprotocol: "0.6", "protocol": "udp" address: "ip or null", port: ""
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this seems more machine friendly
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no need to parse
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Above as in the statefulness pr or the protocol stuff?
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> protocol
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats the exact format for tw-0.6
18:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you can omit the protocol
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the idea of making the connection a URL at all is that you can copy-paste it into the client
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what if someone makes their format dd+0.7
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.6 will never run over quic
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nor will ddnet15 e.g.
18:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ddnet runs over w(eb)s(ockets) though
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm that is an issue :/
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do we need to let ws servers register?
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyway, the scheme isn't really up for debate, it's already locked in stone ðŸ˜…
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well its ok
18:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as in it's used in the server info
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I was more wondering how to to the registration
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, I see what you mean
18:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I think sending it in pieces is easier, no? I don't like string paraing to figure out where to insert the ip
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's probably not easier, there are URL parsing libraries for rust (which the master server was going to be written in, or not?)
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I currently have:
18:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a url parsing lib made by mozilla
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fully compliant
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wym not easier? Separate fields would just be combined with a format!
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://docs.rs/url/2.2.2/url/
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```rs
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     if register.address.scheme() != "tw-0.6+udp" {
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         return Err("register address must start with tw-0.6+udp://".into());
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     }   
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     if register.address.host_str() != Some("connecting-address.invalid") {
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>         return Err("register address must have domain connecting-address.invalid".into());
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     }
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     // [...]
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     let mut address = register.address.clone();
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991>     address.set_ip_host(remote_address).unwrap();
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ```
18:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/servo/rust-url> ðŸ¤“
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not easier if you want to ensure that it results in a well-formed URL. mh. maybe, since IP addresses are always well-formed in the URL
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah with a lib I can see how it's not hard
18:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what about ipv6
18:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it'llâ„¢ be supported by making the game server connect via IPv4 and IPv6 to the master server alternatingly
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you have a token to merge the two registrations or sth, right?
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's the current plan, a secret token by the game server
18:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Proxy support, when?
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym, proxy support? for client <-> game server connections?
18:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> client <-> proxy <-> game server
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> reverse proxy or forward proxy? probably reverse?
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> reverse
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> basically just add "real ip header" support
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> in udp app
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> that would do tbh
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> plus write a proxy
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> We already have an XDP proxy for FiveM
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> ðŸ¤·
18:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I can likely release one publicly for ddnet
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Idea is to basically offer proxies just using ip:port
18:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> without any setup on the actual machine running the game server
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is there some standard UDP reverse proxy format we could emulate?
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't sound too hard otherwise
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I'm not aware of any
18:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> maybe just add an "ip" field in the handshake packet?
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not to all packets?
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> no, just to the handshake.
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, that sounds a bit more complicated then, but still not too much
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> this would likely not be required at all, depending on if bans are IP based or not
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> bans are IP based
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Well yeah, there's the issue then
18:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Check handshake packet for ip field, if it's not-set, use connection ip
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> otherwise, register using IP in handshake
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *if* reverse proxy mode is on
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> smiliar to X-Forwarded-For in nginx
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise you're opening up yourself to be spoofed for all non-reverse-proxied servers
18:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Obviously you would set the proxy ranges
18:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Obviously you would set the proxy ranges to be whitelisted, everything else trying to act as a proxy would be dropped
18:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> Obviously you would set the proxy ranges to be whitelisted, everything else trying to act as a proxy would be dropped / not acked
18:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but there are servers without reverse proxy, these must not accept the IP in the handshake header. so it must be a config option to enable the use of that header
18:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> I'm not saying it should be a required header
18:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> simply check packet length
18:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> simply check packet length, that way you can determine if the header is there or not
18:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FÃ¤n> and of course add a toggle for proxy support
19:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> GER1 just died
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 Why does my server does not show up in the master in DDNet?
19:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> `45.144.246.102:8303`
19:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it doesnt register
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> now it is there for some reason, did i implement something incorrectly regarding the 0.6 register?
19:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it was like this before already, i never understood why because a manual request using Leak IP worked always
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does "it doesn't register" mean?
20:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it registered to the old masterservers?
20:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, it shows up now
21:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @nuborn\: did you plan to finish #4176 any time soon?
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> #4176
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4176
21:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <nuborn> yes, think I can finish it soon, since I have most of the code done (not commited yet)
21:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> awesome, makes the next release even better
