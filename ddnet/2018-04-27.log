01:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can we switch to bam agian pls? ._.
01:12 <+Learath2> can you stop breaking cmake pls?
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it breaks every time .-.
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> bam worked fine c:
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i reinstalled src
01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> now i get proper error messages but im still not able to build the client
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/Ab4IN/75d45f936d.png
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> the devs dont want to support 2 build systems and they prefer the impossible to use system so that normal people cant build ddnet
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ._.
01:25 <+Learath2> did you fetch the libs?
01:26 <+Learath2> So impossible to use that none of us have any problem using it
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> uhm i didn t clonse recursivly
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but now i did
01:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and now it says that i added a buuild/ dir .-.
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah nvm i should create my own file sthere
01:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> makes sense
01:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is there a reason that ``inp_mousesens`` has a minimum of 5 ? it is a bit confusing because it destroys binds with ms between 1 and 4
01:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=5807&p=58207&hilit=mousesens#p58207
01:44 <+Learath2> prolly because 1-4 doesn't make much sense as they are literally unusable
01:44 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] ChillerDragon opened pull request #1120: Allows low mousesens (master...Mousesens) https://git.io/vplEC
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> they are usable
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i tested it
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> worked super fine with my high dpi for edge hooks and it is kinda usefull since ms doesnt update values out of range in binds
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what is the average time of all ranks from every mod combined?🤔
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <黙の裳勝つ> 7
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> 22,456
11:26 <+Davide> Deen
11:26 <+Davide> You're online?
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sometimes yes, sometimes no
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @-Twist°~ how do you arrive at that number?
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum select avg(Time) from record_race where Map != "FlappyBird"; gives me 20 min
11:36 <+Davide> @-Twist°~ Heyy :D
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> I thought 7 was to dumb it has to be higher. But it was just  random number that came to my mind
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> Hey Davide ^^
11:39 <+Davide> Hey :D
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i also would have guessed 7minutes
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <黙の裳勝つ> I thought 7 sounded funny
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> :o
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> 7 could fit if you only look at top10 ranks
13:28 <@deen> 10 minutes is the average of top 1 ranks
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> Close enough😂
13:33 <@deen> And while it sounds like "average people are just twice as slow as top ranks", that's not true, because there will be much more ranks on easy short maps ;)
13:34 <@deen> The average of the average of times on all maps is 38 minutes actually
13:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> Oh I thought he meant moderate now I get the error lol
13:35 <@deen> "every mod" != "every moderate map"
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> Every mod-erate xD
13:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> Whats average time on moderate server though?
13:37 <@deen> average time over all ranks or average of averages per map?
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> Average time over all ranks on moderate maps
13:42 <@deen> 30 min
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> Well thats a lot ... really thought is lower, but I was just scrolling down the page with moderate ranks. So many maps with less than 5min Top ranks
13:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <-Twist°~> @Starkiller  you are pushing the average up 😂
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ```MariaDB [teeworlds]> select Server, avg(Time) / 60 as "Average Minutes" from (select record_race.Map, Name, record_maps.Server, Time from record_race join record_maps on record_race.Map = record_maps.Map group by record_race.Map, Name having record_race.Map != "FlappyBird") as l group by Server;

16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> hi, what about merging cursor and editor cursor into one?
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> editor curser is just a bit smaller
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and can change color depending on what it is hovering over
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> devs: does anyone of you know how the physics were in 2008 teeworlds? i found some of the maps from that very old chanel i posted earlier, and i would like to recreate the same gameplay and perhaps, if there is interest, get them hosted on ddnet.
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> in the videos you can see that the hook is a lot slower. i'd like to know which tunes to make
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Does anyone have low framerates at the moment too?
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Since today I only get like 17 fps, i usually have over 1000. How can i fix this
18:35 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> 17 vs 1000 sounds like software acceleration vs hardware
18:35 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> in almost every game imaginable
18:36 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> NeXus: I'm not at all familiar  w/ DDnet code, apart from reading it to copy what you guys did SDL2-wise but that's usually computer specific - sure you didn't update graphics driver or fail to reboot after changing kernel module?
18:37 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> NeXus: we did at one point accidentally cause fallback to software raster in past long ago when requesting a gl feature that a particular card could not satisfy - again speakin of hedgewars here sorry, but, eh, you guys are probably using same SDL procedure
18:39 <+bridge> [freenode] <nemo> like... SDL_GL_SetAttribute() was causing software fallback, on win32 in particular, if failure to match
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Im 'corneum sure,  tune hook_fire_speed 45 is the correct number: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/1c1677f02300e5ab10bca9c74ce7f49d4605b9d6/src/game/g_protocol.h#L4-L20
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (That's from TW 0.3.3 state)
18:57 <+Davide> @Deen, @Heinrich5991
18:57 <+Davide> I've some problemsa
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nowadays we have tunes, so you should be able to just pump those numbers in and mostly get old physics
18:57 <+Davide> Problems
18:57 <+Davide> I'm going to recompile ddnet source but say me this "CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:357 (message):   You must install MySQL to compile the DDNet server with MySQL support"
18:57 <+Davide> But i've Mysql installed
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mysqlcppconnector installed too?
18:58 <+Davide> I check
18:58 <+Davide> "libmysqlcppconn-dev is already the newest version."
18:58 <+Davide> Yes
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> mysql_config --version
19:01 <+Davide> I think there are conflicts between libmysqlclient-dev and libmariadbclient-dev
19:02 <+Davide> I try to remove all and reinstall
19:02 <@deen> well sure, pick one consistently
19:02 <+Davide> Is ok Mariadb?
19:03 <+Davide> Ok i've tried with only Mariadb
19:03 <+Davide> Now work 
19:03 <+Davide> Very thanks Deen xD
19:41 <@heinrich5991> what? hook became different? :o
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @deen  thanks a lot.  was hook the only difference.(that i could also change)?
19:57 <@deen> compare the numbers yourself with https://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/#tunings
19:58 <@deen> ground_control_speed 7 -> 10
19:58 <@deen> ground_jump_impulse 13.2 -> 12.6 (I guess)
19:59 <@deen> hook_length 340 -> 380
19:59 <@deen> I just realized they had wall jump in TW 0.3.3?!
20:00 <@deen> instead of double jump I guess
20:00 <@deen> air_jump_impulse 11.5 -> 12 (maybe)
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think there was no unhook too
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> so why walljump
20:01 <@deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/1c1677f02300e5ab10bca9c74ce7f49d4605b9d6/src/game/g_protocol.h#L19-L20
20:01 <@deen> there it says walljump
20:02 <@deen> ah, but not used anywhere in source code, just prepared
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> that means it was only planned yet?
20:10 <@deen> seems so
20:11 <@deen> maybe it was there earlier or later
20:26 <@deen> here it still was enabled: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/87ba16401b5576a5f3f9627688903740156a362f
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is wallslide=slopes, or just falling slower when you touch a wall.
21:10 <@deen> falling slower when touching wall
21:11 <@deen> and it enables you to wall jump
21:11 <@deen> not like on ddnet where it recharges your dj
21:12 <@deen> the implementation looks a bit buggy anyway
21:12 <@deen> can just keep jumping on wall without ever leaving it (or that's the intention)
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> sounds nice for beginners that you fall slow on wall when walljumping. wasnt there speedups yet to make it possible?
21:20 <@deen> speedups in tw?
21:21 <@deen> ah, you mean to simulate it in current ddnet
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> in current tw you could use tunezones as well. but back then, with speedups they wouldnt have had to add a new feature
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> oh nevermind, i just remembered that even speedups with the force of 1 give you upspeed eventually
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> is it btw intended that i can write tune zones in server settings directly in the editor? if so, can you make it possible to write longer texts and make tunes that work for the whole map without putting a big tunezone everywhere? i dont want to add .cfg's to the maps and it easier to and fix.

21:31 <@deen> you can just write tunes directly too in the editor's "server settings"
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> thats what i said, but not endlessly long
21:31 <@deen> each line has a limited length?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> last time i tried it did
21:32 <@deen> yeah, but that limit seems long enough to me
21:32 <@deen> you can add multiple lines after all
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i think i had problems with it when i used tune_zone enter
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> then how do i use it in a way that i dont have to spam a tunezone that i want to work on the whole map anyway
21:36 <@deen> well, having them really long makes them a bit awkward to view
