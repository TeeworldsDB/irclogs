07:21 <@deen> Henningstone: well, i didn't test it well, and the implementation is a hack
07:22 <@deen> i'm not happy with it, will probably revert it or need to find time to fix it
08:12 <+laxadedi> deen: hey, just a heads up, I am planning to change my ddracepro server in september, who should I contact to update the dns entry of ts.ddnet.tw the day I do that ?
08:18 <@deen> me
08:18 <+laxadedi> Alright nice !
08:52 <@deen> Well, all the other admins could too, but I don't think they've done dns changes yet
