00:16 < bridge> <newlesstee> How to change the `Activity.assets.large_image`?
02:25 < bridge> <ReiTW> ah
02:25 < bridge> <ReiTW> discord changed the video player
02:25 < bridge> <ReiTW> ah no just the video in #showroom that looks bigger (matricks related)
05:46 < bridge> <<~{Barsik}~>> :troll:
07:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> What’s that
07:29 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@newlesstee)
08:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3677788723152833273
08:33 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Interesting
09:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> Is it about knowing if you are visible to the enemy or not? @Ryozuki
09:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> Yea that was or still is a thing
09:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Idk
09:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Obv they wont tell
09:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> I mean they tell something
09:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> That they reserved memory for the process that doesn't get read. And detected *something* reading that memory region.
09:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> Which implies AoB scanning. (looping through the whole process to find a byte pattern)
09:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> Which implies AoB scanning. (looping through the whole process to find a byte pattern)
09:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> Because I see no reason to read from memory addresses that you didn't explicitly hardcoded.
09:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> That they reserved memory space for the process that doesn't get read. And detected *something* reading that memory region.
09:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> That they reserved memory space for the process that doesn't get read. And detected *something* reading from that memory region.
10:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> Another thing that should be common sense if you are familiar with how they detect stuff is that it must be an usermode application
10:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> So I did my research based on my amazing detective skills and found this project that is using a pattern scanner aka. AoB scanner
10:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://github.com/SK68-ph/Overlay/tree/3.0/Dota2Overlay-3.0
10:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> one reply posted today https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/3686236-post615.html seems to confirm it (though you never know what else the cheaters used claiming something is detected)
10:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> Which implies AoB scanning. (looping through the whole process to find a byte pattern)
10:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> Because I see no other reason to read from memory addresses that you didn't explicitly hardcoded.
10:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what does AoB stand for?
10:30 < bridge> <DefaultO> So yes. Players that used the tool that tells you if you are visible to enemy or not got banned for a long time.
10:30 < bridge> <DefaultO> array of bytes
11:39 < bridge> <Raks> @Patiga 
11:39 < bridge> <Raks> 1. Step i download the zip and unzip it on my desktop.
11:39 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077902364998115368/image.png
11:40 < bridge> <Patiga> have you ever worked with a terminal/console?
11:40 < bridge> <Raks> Not really
11:40 < bridge> <Raks> @Patiga 
11:41 < bridge> <Raks> 1. Step | I download the zip and unzip it on my desktop.
11:41 < bridge> <Patiga> for what do you want to use the bot btw?
11:42 < bridge> <Raks> 2. Step | I click on the https://discord.com/developers/applications link and create an app.
11:42 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077903148489912370/image.png
11:42 < bridge> <Raks> For my own custom ddnet server
11:42 < bridge> <Raks> 😄
11:42 < bridge> <Patiga> but what should the bot do in that channel?
11:42 < bridge> <Patiga> ist it about the $profile command?
11:43 < bridge> <Raks> No, like submit maps etc...
11:43 < bridge> <Raks> $ready
11:43 < bridge> <Raks> $release
11:43 < bridge> <Patiga> oh okay
11:43 < bridge> <Raks> and automatically put in my server
11:43 < bridge> <Raks> Is that what it does right?
11:43 < bridge> <Patiga> that will require setup way beyond what I did with the discordbot
11:44 < bridge> <ReiTW> damn currently checking spf and dmarc records over 228449808 domain names :giga_chad: I think ddnet is in
11:44 < bridge> <Patiga> I'm not sure if it is realistic for you to set it up, but I can go through the steps with you
11:44 < bridge> <Patiga> note that in the steps, we explicitly turn off that functionality ^^
11:45 < bridge> <Patiga> step 2 looks good tho, got the token?
11:45 < bridge> <Raks> If i share the token what will happen?
11:45 < bridge> <Patiga> that person can control the bot in any way they like
11:45 < bridge> <Patiga> dont share it
11:46 < bridge> <DefaultO> that would require some knowledge yea. he wants to have his own ddnet it seems like.
11:46 < bridge> <ReiTW> :giga_chad:
11:46 < bridge> <ReiTW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077904310496677960/image.png
11:47 < bridge> <DefaultO> ddnet.shop
11:47 < bridge> <DefaultO> some asian parked site
11:47 < bridge> <Raks> I have those and also Client ID at other page
11:47 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077904518299271268/image.png
11:47 < bridge> <ReiTW> lmao
11:48 < bridge> <Raks> Wich one
11:48 < bridge> <DefaultO> the one that starts with a ``!`` or ``#``
11:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> Bot Tab
11:49 < bridge> <Raks> oh my bad i didnt add the bot yet but i did now. 🫢
11:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077905079467769856/image.png
11:50 < bridge> <DefaultO> you should have a generate token button
11:50 < bridge> <Raks> Yes i have the token now
11:50 < bridge> <DefaultO> but I phrase it like that. even if we guide you through the instructions. you want something completely different.
11:52 < bridge> <Raks> still step 2 | turn on this two
11:52 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077905682570940516/image.png
11:52 < bridge> <Raks> and copy the token
11:53 < bridge> <Patiga> yes that needs to be emphasized, of the entire infrastructure you casually mentioned that you want to set up, the discordbot might be the easiest
11:54 < bridge> <Raks> 3. Step | Go bac kto the surce file see on the 1. picture, and create a copy of the file on the 2. picture and name it as "config.ini"
11:54 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077906308939911199/image.png
11:54 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077906309329977354/image.png
11:54 < bridge> <Raks> 3. Step | Go back to the source file see on the 1. picture, and create a copy of the file on the 2. picture and name it as "config.ini"
11:55 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077906308939911199/image.png

11:55 < bridge> <Patiga> if you don't mind sharing, for what purpose do you want to replicate the ddnet infrastructure? I don't have anything against a new server group, but if that is your goal, be warned that this is a big undertaking
11:55 < bridge> <DefaultO> deen got depressed and nearly gave up ^^
11:56 < bridge> <Raks> Well this server just should be for my little community
11:56 < bridge> <Raks> Friends and random invited peoples
11:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> then I suggest you approve the maps manually
11:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> i think you can config your own server to only pick maps from your own map pool
11:56 < bridge> <Patiga> I don't think you need a map testing setup if its just for a small group of people you mostly trust
11:56 < bridge> <Raks> Thats way too long :/
11:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea but what do you think the bot does
11:57 < bridge> <Raks> This bot would make it more easly
11:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> not really
11:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> the map testers get pinged (maybe) and get the map file
11:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> they still have to manually approve it
11:57 < bridge> <Raks> i would get tired of editing the channels and download and delete the maps always
11:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> then figure out a concept that fits your needs and doesn't require you to be somewhat talented with computers
11:58 < bridge> <Patiga> you could automate that small part of the process. I think the ddnet setup is very much overkill for your purpose
11:59 < bridge> <Patiga> you probably only need a script that takes a map, copies it to the server
11:59 < bridge> <Patiga> and maybe another one that copies it from the testing server to the 'actual' server
11:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> something like that
11:59 < bridge> <DefaultO> the discord bot is filled with so much more functionality
12:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> and the things you want from it get disabled with the provided instructions
12:00 < bridge> <Raks> So that what you all mean like its ain't possible?
12:00 < bridge> <DefaultO> it is
12:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> but I don't think you can make the bot do what you want it to do without help
12:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> also would be better to just make your own discord bot at that point
12:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> the one in the ddnet org is outdated and gets updated atm
12:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> the one in the ddnet org is outdated (deprecated packages) and gets updated atm
12:02 < bridge> <Raks> So what would i get if i go through on the steps?
12:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> the commands that rely on the website api
12:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> #bot-cmds
12:03 < bridge> <Patiga> it is beyond our knowledge how to set up the infrastructure you mentioned. what you actually need is a tiny portion of that infrastructure. your use-case sounds like it would be easier manually or with some minor scripts (or maybe a small own discord bot)
12:03 < bridge> <DefaultO> trust the stone
12:04 < bridge> <Patiga> you will actually get the testing commands, but only the discord portion of it. the thing you actually need of it, $ready, $release and the initial upload to the testing servers, will require much more steup
12:04 < bridge> <ReiTW> just do a small discord bot that listens to a channel & wait for any file, then just download it using requests (if u like python cuz javascript sucks) lib and done
12:06 < bridge> <Raks> And how can i make a bot like that or i really have to learn that?
12:06 < bridge> <ReiTW> chatgpt
12:06 < bridge> <ReiTW> ez
12:06 < bridge> <ReiTW> :giga_chad:
12:06 < bridge> <DefaultO> Programming experience would be beneficial
12:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> but you can paste something together with whatever the internet throws at you
12:08 < bridge> <Raks> Is that thing will help me automatically edit the channels?
12:08 < bridge> <Raks> by commands
12:08 < bridge> <ReiTW> that thing will help u to make some code, with a probability that it throws you some garbage code also
12:09 < bridge> <Raks> Ahw
12:10 < bridge> <Avolicious> And care with auto uploading to the test-servers, people will abuse it & upload a ton of bs. So let your testers react with an emoji to any file & then upload it to the server 🙂
12:12 < bridge> <DefaultO> like this, for example
12:12 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077910714976583740/testest.gif
12:12 < bridge> <ReiTW> nodejs sux
12:12 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> @Raks maybe just do some simple python script like that:
12:12 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> 
12:12 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> import discord
12:12 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> from discord.ext import commands
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> 
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix= '!', intents=discord.Intents.all())
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> 
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> save_path = 'Desktop/server/data/maps'
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> 
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> @bot.command()
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> async def save_file(ctx, *, file: discord.Attachment):
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX>     try:
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX>         await file.save(save_path + file.filename)
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX>     except Execption as e:
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX>     #print error message
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX>         print(e)
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX>         await ctx.send('An error occurred while saving the file..')
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX>     else:
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX>         await ctx.send(f'File saved')
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> 
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> client.run(BOT_TOKEN)
12:13 < bridge> <DefaultO> that's C#
12:13 < bridge> <ReiTW> is it lol? C# has var keyword?
12:13 < bridge> <DefaultO> yes
12:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> @Raks if there is only ur friends in the server its safe to use
12:13 < bridge> <DefaultO> but its not like javascripts var
12:13 < bridge> <ReiTW> looks ugly
12:13 < bridge> <DefaultO> once a type was assigned to it (it takes any for the first time)
12:14 < bridge> <DefaultO> you can only assign the same type after that
12:14 < bridge> <Raks> i dont even know where to make this ahh
12:14 < bridge> <DefaultO> for "any type" you have to use generics
12:14 < bridge> <Raks> I downlaoded python but
12:14 < bridge> <DefaultO> also known as that <T>
12:14 < bridge> <Raks> I downlodaed python but
12:14 < bridge> <Raks> I downloaded python but
12:15 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> create a file called "maps.py" and paste that script in, change it to ur bot token and put the right 'maps' path
12:15 < bridge> <DefaultO> you hate it, you love it
12:15 < bridge> <Avolicious> Best way to start is setting up your development environment. Use any editor as you like, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Notepad etc etc etc. personally i'd recommend using a code editor with proper syntax highlighting, this will help you so much 🙂
12:16 < bridge> <Raks> ?
12:16 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077911709429284944/image.png
12:16 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> yes
12:17 < bridge> <Raks> i have notepad++ and Visual studios either
12:17 < bridge> <Avolicious> Fair enough, do you wanna run it 24/7 or just when you're online?
12:17 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> if u want to do a discord bot its better to learn the basics of python or javascript @Raks
12:17 < bridge> <Raks> When im online
12:18 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> i need to go now.
12:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Itube bot
12:18 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> fokkonut
12:18 < bridge> <fokkonaut> known botter
12:18 < bridge> <Raks> Well i can learn it time after time with some help at the first
12:18 < bridge> <Avolicious> Then your local computer is fine 🙂 Create a folder on your desktop or <insert path you like> to keep things clean
12:19 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> yes best bots))
12:19 < bridge> <Raks> Yes?
12:19 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077912484662476830/image.png
12:19 < bridge> <Avolicious> Now you've added the maps.py inside, no?
12:19 < bridge> <Raks> yes
12:19 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077912603235467315/image.png
12:20 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> uh i didnt test the script, maybe its not working i just write it really quick. well need to go now gl @Raks
12:20 < bridge> <Avolicious> Awesome! You can start using your IDE/Editor with "Open folder" ( most editors do have such an option )
12:20 < bridge> <Raks> Thanks i hope i can make something working
12:20 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> 😄
12:20 < bridge> <Raks> huh
12:21 < bridge> <Raks> OH
12:21 < bridge> <Raks> open visual studios right?
12:21 < bridge> <Avolicious> Yeah, if you like the editor, go for it 🙂
12:21 < bridge> <Raks> done
12:21 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077913065330327683/image.png
12:21 < bridge> <DefaultO> nah
12:21 < bridge> <DefaultO> that one doesnt have python support by default
12:22 < bridge> <Avolicious> Thats my next question 🙂
12:22 < bridge> <DefaultO> it would treat it like a text file
12:22 < bridge> <Avolicious> You can install python support in VS
12:22 < bridge> <Avolicious> https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/features/python/

12:22 < bridge> <Raks> ?
12:22 < bridge> <Avolicious> https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/en/vs/features/python/
12:22 < bridge> <Avolicious> Yes
12:22 < bridge> <Raks> i have that
12:22 < bridge> <Raks> ^^
12:23 < bridge> <Raks> Open thy python then?
12:23 < bridge> <Avolicious> You can open the "maps.py" now
12:23 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077913511562326056/image.png
12:23 < bridge> <Avolicious> Not the console 😄
12:23 < bridge> <Raks> When i double click on the maps.py it just flash up and gone
12:24 < bridge> <Avolicious> Yep, thats why you need to open the folder/file with "Open with Visual Studio"
12:24 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077913747307372547/NVIDIA_Share_caeWrTYyZn.gif

12:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Dont talk to me after saying that
12:26 < bridge> <Avolicious> Dont wanna start talking about nvidia drivers on linux
12:27 < bridge> <Avolicious> They are made out of cr\*\*
12:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Maybe gaming
12:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> But office
12:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Ur joking xdd
12:27 < bridge> <Avolicious> In the enterprise sector, only windows is being used
12:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Agh
12:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> I wanna poke
12:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Bye
12:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> Ryozuki is like linux tech tips who thought no one uses Outlook/365
12:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> but everyone uses that crap
12:28 < bridge> <Avolicious> And I am not talking about those tiny lil' fancy startups you might think of
12:28 < bridge> <Raks> Before y'all start argue about linux or win please help 😦
12:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> learn to code kid
12:28 < bridge> <DefaultO> jk
12:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Its hilarious companies rely on windows and give em so much control, valve realizes that
12:29 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Nothing to argue about, windows just better :troll:
12:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Ur fooling urself if u think its better
12:29 < bridge> <DefaultO> more convenient
12:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Its convenient cuz the feedback loop
12:30 < bridge> <Avolicious> After you setup everything you need, give google a try & see how it works to use python and discord.py https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/
12:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Linux is actually better
12:30 < bridge> <Raks> What setup
12:30 < bridge> <ReiTW> depends if u talk about servers or clients
12:30 < bridge> <Raks> ;-;
12:30 < bridge> <Avolicious> After you setup everything you need, give google a try & see how it works to use python and discord.py https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/

12:30 < bridge> <Avolicious> And before people starting arguing about the tutorial decision: Its just a tutorial from thousands of tutorials
12:30 < bridge> <Avolicious> Even windows servers are being used
12:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Pls
12:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xddd
12:31 < bridge> <fokkonaut> windows servers 🤡
12:31 < bridge> <ReiTW> windows servers are only used because Active Directory is powerful af even if it's a big hole full of vulnerabilities
12:31 < bridge> <Avolicious> Your development setup
12:31 < bridge> <Raks> They are glitchy
12:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Even azure uses linux
12:31 < bridge> <Ryozuki> I wish more did like valve
12:31 < bridge> <Avolicious> No, azure is just their whole cloud name
12:32 < bridge> <Avolicious> On azure you can get linux and windows
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Its better to make softare for a os not owned by another company
12:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> But the feedback loop is hard to break
12:32 < bridge> <Raks> Wdym by that?

12:33 < bridge> <Avolicious> In order to update/edit and enhance your bot, you need a development environment.

12:51 < bridge> <Ewan> Linux has its use cases and there are many that it’s amazing at. From the server side, most companies opt to use some form of Linux & the popularity of Docker in recent years (among other things) has made it the more popular option for new developments. Windows is still massive for IoT though thanks to Active Directory & whatever packages it provides
12:54 < bridge> <Ewan> I actually dont wanna get into the windows/linux thing

13:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> i think you also have to explain to him how to get the discord package using npm before you just give him the code that crashed before already
13:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> i think you also have to explain to him how to get the discord package using npm before you just give him the code that crashed before for him already
13:01 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> its avo's job
13:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> its your code
13:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> excuse me?
13:01 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> eh
13:02 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> but not my job how to download the pachages
13:02 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> also im using linux
13:02 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> idk how its on win xd
13:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> the same way
13:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> npm install
13:02 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> ok
13:02 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> nice
13:02 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> u told him now
13:02 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> not me
13:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> no i did not
13:02 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> ok
13:02 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> edit message
13:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> if you want them to run your code
13:02 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> complete it
13:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> go explain it to them
13:03 < bridge> <DefaultO> your behavior rn is just lazy
13:03 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> should i create a repo
13:03 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> and put a readme
13:03 < bridge> <DefaultO> do whatever you want
13:03 < bridge> <DefaultO> but if you won't even give them the proper instructions on how to use your code
13:03 < bridge> <DefaultO> then don't bother sending in your code
13:03 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> ok
13:03 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> sorry boss
13:03 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> i understand
13:04 < bridge> <Raks> When i watch the video of coding tutorial there should be secret the token bc anyone can steal it idk how tho
13:04 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> 🧑‍🌾
13:04 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> do u know how/where u get the token?
13:04 < bridge> <Raks> Yes
13:04 < bridge> <Raks> THe bot token right?
13:04 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> yes
13:04 < bridge> <Raks> The bot token right?
13:04 < bridge> <Raks> Yes i know
13:04 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> change "your-token" to ur token
13:05 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> dont delete the ' '

13:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> thats not my script
13:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> xd
13:13 < bridge> <Raks> I know
13:13 < bridge> <Raks> i tryed by myself
13:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> i can only help you with my script
13:13 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> :))
13:14 < bridge> <Raks> U dont know whats wrong with that?
13:14 < bridge> <Raks> its happens when i run it
13:15 < bridge> <Raks> Okay i just copy yours

13:18 < bridge> <Raks> The token already typed in
13:20 < bridge> <DefaultO> do what it tells you to do
13:21 < bridge> <DefaultO> you could have fixed that one yourself if you would read
13:21 < bridge> <Raks> Oh yeah i got it my bad
13:22 < bridge> <Raks> What should it do
13:22 < bridge> <Raks> ?
13:22 < bridge> <Raks> I mean how is it works
13:23 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> its running?
13:24 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> if yes do !save_file and put ur map in the same message
13:24 < bridge> <Raks> oh thats all?
13:24 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> then the file will be saved in ur folder
13:24 < bridge> <Raks> lol
13:24 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> the path u sayed
13:24 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> very simple script
13:25 < bridge> <Raks> lemem test it
13:25 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> and also the uploader needs the role 'Mapper'
13:25 < bridge> <Raks> lemme test it
13:25 < bridge> <Raks> Not really
13:25 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> and also the uploader need the role 'Mapper'
13:25 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> yes
13:25 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> u know my script better then me
13:25 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> i guess

13:39 < bridge> <Ewan> LMFAO
13:40 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> open the terminal in visual studio
13:41 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> and use for example `python main.py`
13:41 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> or `python3 main.py`
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> there’s no terminal in visual studio
13:53 < bridge> <Ewan> the closest thing is the developer powershell/cmd instances
13:54 < bridge> <Ewan> neither of which have python installed by default
13:57 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> there is
13:57 < bridge> <Ewan> where
13:57 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> a
13:57 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> its vscode
13:57 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> mb
13:58 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
13:58 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> im using vscode im used to deal with the options idk xd
14:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> there is
14:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> i use it to compile c# natively
14:03 < bridge> <DefaultO> because it doesn't have the build option for nativeaot yet
14:03 < bridge> <Raks> so where do i have to click now?
14:04 < bridge> <Raks> ?
14:12 < bridge> <DefaultO> there is, it's called terminal
14:16 < bridge> <Ewan> that's just the dev ps instance
14:16 < bridge> <Ewan> but you're right it is a terminal lol
14:19 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> what
14:19 < bridge> <DefaultO> No i mean the one tab at the bottom
14:19 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> see randomly im right
14:20 < bridge> <DefaultO> when I am @ home I will make a screenshot for you @Ewan Green
14:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i don't need a screenshot
14:20 < bridge> <Ewan> i went and looked for it and it's there
14:20 < bridge> <Ewan> but it's really out of the way lol i never would have known it was there
14:21 < bridge> <DefaultO> also it wasn't part of visual studio before it seems like since I wasn't able to find it in the local installation at my workspace
14:22 < bridge> <Raks> How to run it
14:26 < bridge> <DefaultO> nevermind I looked at the wrong spot
14:27 < bridge> <DefaultO> to anyone else: ``View > Terminal`` or ``View > Other Windows > Command Prompt``
14:30 < bridge> <DefaultO> to show a command prompt inside visual studio ide instead of opening an external command prompt using ``Extras > Command Line > Developer...``
14:36 < bridge> <Itube / 'SYLEX> i told u??
14:36 < bridge> <Raks> whereee
14:36 < bridge> <Raks> i dont get it
14:39 < bridge> <Raks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1077947648302129222/image.png
14:39 < bridge> <Raks> how to add the folder for save?
16:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks maybe u know this
16:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u know how to declare a _ExtInt(N) literal that has more than the max literal value allowed?
16:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> `_ExtInt(300) prime = 999999999999999999999999999999999;`
16:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> _ExtInt is a clang extension, it does the same that _BitInt(N) does (standarized in c++23, but the extension from clang is available before)
16:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i know u can get it doing bit shift and cast shenaningans but thats godly awful
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> `error: integer literal is too large to be represented in any integer type`
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> stupid
16:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> i mean that number is obviously bigger than the upper limit
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> no
16:07 < bridge> <DefaultO> no?
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its not bigger than a 300bit integer lol
16:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u dont understand the issue here
16:08 < bridge> <DefaultO> -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
16:08 < bridge> <DefaultO> oh 300bit
16:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> _ExtInt (_BitInt in c++23) allows declaring ints of n bits
16:09 < bridge> <DefaultO> doesn't seem to work as intended
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2709.pdf
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im sure i need to add some suffix to the literal
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but idk which
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i tried `999999999999999999999999999999999_ExtInt300`
16:09 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but no
16:10 < bridge> <DefaultO> I mean this is convincing:
16:10 < bridge> <DefaultO> ```The error message you are seeing is because the integer literal "999999999999999999999999999999999" is too large to be represented by any integer type. In C++, the largest integer type is typically "long long int", which can represent integers up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.```
16:10 < bridge> <DefaultO> it suggested a library
16:10 < bridge> <DefaultO> but thats not what you want
16:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Future Directions > Adding literal suffixes to form integer constants with a bit-precise type.
16:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> from the paper
16:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> F
16:13 < bridge> <DefaultO> This does what you want. Maybe you can hibbity hoppity, take some code snippet and make it your property. https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/blob/develop/include/boost/multiprecision/cpp_int.hpp
16:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nah i wanted it natively
16:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and in clang cuz llvm
16:13 < bridge> <Ryozuki> wanted to know if there is  a bug with big int division
16:14 < bridge> <DefaultO> is GMP part of the windows api?
16:15 < bridge> <DefaultO> ```c++
16:15 < bridge> <DefaultO> #include <gmpxx.h>
16:15 < bridge> <DefaultO> using namespace std;
16:15 < bridge> <DefaultO> 
16:15 < bridge> <DefaultO> int main() {
16:15 < bridge> <DefaultO>     mpz_class prime = "999999999999999999999999999999999";
16:15 < bridge> <DefaultO>     cout << prime << endl;
16:15 < bridge> <DefaultO>     return 0;
16:15 < bridge> <DefaultO> }```
16:15 < bridge> <DefaultO> ah no
16:17 < bridge> <DefaultO> ``__int128`` is a thing but that isn't supported everywhere and requires you to compile using MSVC
16:17 < bridge> <DefaultO> ``__int128`` is a thing but that isn't supported everywhere and requires you to compile using MSVC
16:17 < bridge> <DefaultO> ```c++

16:17 < bridge> <DefaultO> ```
16:22 < bridge> <DefaultO> Yea I only find libraries that implement a big int datatype, no clue what your original plan was using bitshift
16:25 < bridge> <DefaultO> Yea I only find libraries that implement a big int datatype, no clue what your original plan was using bitshift. The problem with n-bit integers is that you have to assign the value to it. And that arbitrary value can't be represented by C++ itself.

The problem with n-bit integers is that you have to assign the value to it. And that arbitrary value can't be represented by C++ itself. Even if the bits could logically speaking properly store that value.
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO> You obviously can make your own implementation for something like that as shown below:
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO> ```c++
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO> class LargeInt {
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>     private:
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>         const static int ARRAY_SIZE = 2; // number of unsigned long long integers to store the large integer
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>         unsigned long long data[ARRAY_SIZE];
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>     public:
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>         LargeInt(unsigned long long value) {
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>             data[0] = value;
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>             data[1] = 0;
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>         }
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>         LargeInt(unsigned long long high, unsigned long long low) {
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>             data[0] = low;
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>             data[1] = high;
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>         }
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>         LargeInt operator+(const LargeInt& other) const {
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>             unsigned long long carry = 0;
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>             unsigned long long sum_low = data[0] + other.data[0];
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>             carry = sum_low < data[0] ? 1 : 0;
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>             unsigned long long sum_high = data[1] + other.data[1] + carry;
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>             return LargeInt(sum_high, sum_low);
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>         }
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>         friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const LargeInt& obj) {
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>             os << obj.data[1] << obj.data[0];
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>             return os;
16:31 < bridge> <DefaultO>         }
16:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> };
16:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> ```
16:32 < bridge> <DefaultO> but that's not too different to using a third party library that already did that for you
16:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I'd say u need a postfix literal
16:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Smth like 9999_extint
16:44 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or create it from a string
16:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Or find a multiplication that results in Ur value and multiple them: 99999LL * 111111111LL
16:59 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i mean this isn’t impossible by any means
17:05 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ye but i dont know which
17:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U can create an literal operator yourself if clang doesn't provide one
18:14 < bridge> <Chairn> cant you initialize it from string translated at compile time, or directly byte array?
18:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> r u creating the next cookie clicker, or what do u even need 300bits for xd
18:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nah
18:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> finite field arithmetic
18:29 < bridge> <Ryozuki> was just testing something
18:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its ok its just more combinations than atoms in the universe

19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> this does not happen when i update the values each time it's rendered
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> if you can't see it's messing up the map/transformation and the bar is really small in the corner
19:07 < bridge> <Ewan> oh it's `    Graphics()->MapScreen(0.0f, 0.0f, m_Width, m_Height);` specifically that's the issue. wut?
19:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> other components call that function too
19:08 < bridge> <Ewan> oh i didn't realize it was a global thing i guess
19:08 < bridge> <Ewan> but that makes sense
19:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I like python for finite fields
19:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah it works nice cuz inf integer
19:17 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but im doing this with llvm ir xd
19:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 0 * inf
19:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can also easily get the inverse in python:
19:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `pow(2, -1, 3)`
19:38 < bridge> <Learath2> I wonder if something like `_ExtInt(300) prime = std::numeric_limits<decltype(prime)>::max()` might work 😛
19:39 < bridge> <Learath2> Oh you wanted sth else, I misread it as you wanting to initialize to the max
19:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nah xd
19:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i want a literal
19:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that is bigger than long long
19:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> anyway im not touching c++ more
19:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i just wanted to confirm if division worked correctly on llvm-ir with big integers
19:43 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and it does from my tests
19:43 < bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, I just took a quick glance at the standard and it doesn't seem really possible unless clang also added a suffix themselves
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```llvm
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> source_filename = "root"
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> declare i32 @printf(ptr, ...)
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> define i32 @print(i1 %0) {
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> entry:
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki>   %prefix = alloca [4 x i8], align 1
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki>   store [4 x i8] c"%d\0A\00", ptr %prefix, align 1
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki>   %printed_characters_n = call i32 (ptr, ...) @printf(ptr %prefix, i1 %0)
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki>   ret i32 %printed_characters_n
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> }
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> define i32 @main() {
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki> entry:
19:44 < bridge> <Ryozuki>   %s = sdiv i500 2457975212345678912345678923456723456789, 3
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki>   %x = icmp eq i500 %s, 819325070781892970781892974485574485596
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki>   %p = call i32 @print(i1 %x)
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki>   ret i32 %p
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> }
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> this prints 1
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> so its correct the division
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i got the division result with python
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> (i made up the first number)
19:45 < bridge> <Learath2> Why are you writing llvm ir btw? finally making your own language?
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i am
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> at work
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but soon also for myself
19:45 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> doing this at work makes me itch to do my own lang
19:46 < bridge> <Learath2> Do JVM bytecode instead
19:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nah
19:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> llvm is awesome
19:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> mlir looks promising too
19:46 < bridge> <Learath2> Corporations love Java, you'll get big points with your boss
19:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> my boss hates java
19:46 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and haskell
19:46 < bridge> <Learath2> Fake corpo
19:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> likes erlang, rust, elixir
19:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> julia
19:47 < bridge> <Learath2> Are you generating the IR by hand btw? I saw a cute library to work with it a couple weeks ago
19:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im using inkwell
19:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it makes u write llvm correctly
19:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also rly useful to learn llvm
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/inkwell
19:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> do note that big int operations like im doing are only supported from llvm 16
19:48 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> How to get the log of core dump of ddnet server? Using ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS with systemd
19:48 < bridge> <Learath2> log of core dump?
19:49 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> core dump sry
19:50 < bridge> <Learath2> But what do you want to do? Open it in gdb? send it to someone?
19:50 < bridge> <Learath2> With systemd `coredumpctl` collects all the dumps
19:50 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> see why the server crashed
19:50 < bridge> <Learath2> `coredumpctl list` to find the dump
19:51 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Ok thanks. I didn't have the coredumpctl installed though. If it crashed again I should be able to see the dump though, right?
19:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i can say im a level above ur C chadness by doing llvm ir
19:51 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :BASEDDEPT:
19:52 < bridge> <Learath2> iiii don't know what systemd does, didn't even know it was possible to have coredumpctl not installed 😛
19:52 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> 😉
19:52 < bridge> <Ryozuki> btw the division from that code outputs 50k instructions xD
19:53 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://godbolt.org/z/bWoY6qPWW
19:53 < bridge> <Learath2> you can try `cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` to see where the cores go
19:54 < bridge> <Learath2> 50k? seriously?
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its a rly high bit count
19:54 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> `|/lib/systemd/systemd-coredump %P %u %g %s %t <number> %h`
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well thats what the t ool says
19:54 < bridge> <Ryozuki> in godbolt
19:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Iterations:        100
19:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Instructions:      40000

19:55 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Block RThroughput: 92.0
19:55 < bridge> <Learath2> Maybe it's 400 instructions times 100 iterations?
19:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> I guess
20:38 < bridge> <Chairn> looks highly unoptimized though
20:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its not run through any optimizer
20:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oh u can pass O3
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> would ddnet be interested in this feature
21:05 < bridge> <Ewan> https://github.com/danielkempf/TaterClient-ddnet/pull/14
21:06 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i know the cstring thing is probs wrong
21:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also this is not the ddnet client
21:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ive been fooled
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> could be an env thing on my end but tbh i couldn't be bothered to play with that & it's technically right because it was erroring saying strlen wasn't a defined symbol
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah ik
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i mean
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i would happily port to ddnet cuz it's a small feature. but would it be welcome
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> want to ask before submitting pr and spending time on that
21:07 < bridge> <Ewan> i would happily port to ddnet cuz it's a small feature. but would it be welcome? that's what i'm asking
21:08 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont rly like it but u should hear others
21:12 < bridge> <Ewan> 👍
21:34 < bridge> <jao's hairy kebab> looks like start of ddOS
21:34 < bridge> <Ewan> what
