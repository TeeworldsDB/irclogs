00:21 < bridge> <Ewan> weird terminology
00:21 < bridge> <Ewan> they're called primitives
00:23 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i called em that for ease of understanding, but you're right
00:23 < bridge> <Ewan> i hardly think using the wrong term will help anyone to understand
00:24 < bridge> <Ewan> shrug
06:19 < bridge> <gerdoe> :kek:
07:43 < ChillerDragon> quakenet moment
07:44  * ChillerDragon does this end up in irc logs? but not on discord? o.O
07:48 < bridge> <Ewan> mustard
07:49 < ChillerDragon> i have an idea @davide55 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
07:50 < ChillerDragon> i think my browser cached fakin ger10.ddnet.org and never made an request
07:50 < ChillerDragon> i had the same on fokkos server now and it for the life of it would not whitelist me so i did it via curl and it worked
07:50 < ChillerDragon> idk why i even used the browser in the first place
07:51 < ChillerDragon> maybe some js fetch() call could avoid caching 
08:06 < ChillerDragon> I managed to get a reproducible crashbug in my cursed dev env. Its butchered data folder custom client custom server 0.7 map. I would just ignore it but if someone is interested here is the backtrace https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/js
08:17 < ChillerDragon> ok nvm that bug was alr fixed in latest ddnet i was running some old stuff on ma laptop. Was caused by the 0.7 map loading i guess
09:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> 0.7 always the problem
09:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> remove
09:06 < bridge> <Ewan> You can send HTTP headers which signal to the browser that it shouldnâ€™t cache the page
09:07 < bridge> <Ewan> Smth like this iirc
09:07 < bridge> <Ewan> Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate
09:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> or just control f5
09:12 < bridge> <Ewan> well no shit
09:12 < bridge> <Ewan> but why do u expect the user to do that
09:12 < bridge> <Ewan> that is not setting anyone up for success
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> sometimes ur a bit douche
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i never said anything about that
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was talking about chiller
09:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk if douche is a word xd

09:46 < bridge> <Ewan> o i see
09:46 < bridge> <Ewan> we have reply feature
09:46 < bridge> <Ewan> hopefully u see how ur comment could be seen as dumb if it was in response to what i said lol
09:46 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I use curl BTW
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah xd i dont reply to chillerdragon comments because i think he doesnt see them
09:49 < bridge> <Ewan> :feelsbadman:
11:16 < ChillerDragon> ryo respecting da irc oosers
11:16 < ChillerDragon> pog
11:16 < ChillerDragon> i see replies on da phone
11:16 < ChillerDragon> at least i see "reply to (null)" xd
11:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the ddnet is well made
11:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> the code makes sense
11:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i like it
11:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> wat
11:24 < ChillerDragon> yes jopsti ddnet code nice
11:24 < ChillerDragon> stop hating it already
11:26 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki i dont get ur meme u posted 2040 is further away -.-
11:27 < ChillerDragon> also no memes in #developer
11:27 < ChillerDragon> thats a bannable offense
11:27 < ChillerDragon> only irc users alre allowed to write offtopic stuff or post memes in #developer
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> ??
11:28 < ChillerDragon> until heinrich also bridges #off-topic to irc
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u read
11:28 < ChillerDragon> i cant read
11:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> it says 2040 is closer
11:28 < ChillerDragon> but it isnt
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 2950 is also closer than 2014
11:28 < ChillerDragon> how
11:28 < ChillerDragon> closer to what
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh true
11:29 < ChillerDragon> i dont get it
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> i cant read
11:29 < ChillerDragon> trol xd
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> why did i see this meme lol
11:29 < ChillerDragon> ryo got scammed by date propaganda
11:29 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xDDD
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> xddd
11:30 < ChillerDragon> 0.7 is closer than 0.6
11:31 < ChillerDragon> think about that
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> not rly
11:31 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> closer to being removed? i agree
11:31 < ChillerDragon> 0.6.5 is closer to 7 than to 6
11:31 < ChillerDragon> idk
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> is there a math thing
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> is 1 closer to 0 or 2
11:32 < ChillerDragon> closer to 2
11:32 < ChillerDragon> 2 is the future
11:33 < ChillerDragon> im too lazy to google
11:33 < ChillerDragon> my dns is broken
11:33 < ChillerDragon> ok fuck it who needs dns 
11:33 < ChillerDragon> enuff irc trolling for today
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> > yes jopsti ddnet code nice
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> You mean code like this chiller?
11:33 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª>

11:34 < ChillerDragon> beautiful
11:34 < ChillerDragon> only way it could be nicer would be rewriting it in modern java
11:34 < ChillerDragon> okay those lines actually are a bit trol
11:35 < ChillerDragon> looks still like pro C++ code to me
11:36 < ChillerDragon> also thanks for irc friendly reply jopstibobsti UwU
11:37 < ChillerDragon> ok now i rly close irc. I clearly have an irc addiction.
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> this code is so much: "I am a c dev, i know what i am doing"
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> "Just because you find it unintuitive, doesn't mean it's bad"
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
11:37 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xd
11:42 < bridge> <Ewan> we round at .5/50% so itâ€™d be 2 but really itâ€™s arbitrary and silly and itâ€™s equally far
11:44 < bridge> <Ewan> who has the placement new fetish
11:45 < bridge> <Ewan> i already seen it for the kernel or client (idr which)
11:45 < bridge> <Ewan> why is it being written this way
11:45 < bridge> <Ewan> we round *up at .5/50% so itâ€™d be 2 but really itâ€™s arbitrary and silly and itâ€™s equally far
11:46 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what is the best way to convert hls color to int ?
11:46 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> look how the color picker did it xd
11:46 < bridge> <Ewan> for what
11:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
11:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> int ColorFeet = ColorHSLA(m_ColorFeet).UnclampLighting().Pack(ms_DarkestLGT7);
11:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ``` 
11:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ha ?
11:48 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> looks like it
11:48 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i prefer rewrite the function myself, it sound more simple
11:48 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
11:48 < bridge> <Ewan> donâ€™t
11:48 < bridge> <Ewan> that is the best way
11:49 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it calls 3 functions to convert
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> unclamp light is, if u want your color not be very dark
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i dunno what the darkestlgt7 does tho
11:50 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but what exactly is wrong with 3 functions?
11:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> why isn't it like ```cpp
11:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ColorFeet = ColorHSLA(255,255,255);
11:51 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> bcs ColorHSLA is not a int
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it's a wrapper for HSL + alpha
11:52 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it's feet color, what alpha doing there ?
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u can leave the unclamplighting out, if you want dark colors
11:52 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> feet can also be transparent
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> just call it with a forth argument
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but anyway, if u want it simpler. create an operator overload for int
11:53 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then u can do what u want
11:53 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> let me study that
12:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how about this ?
12:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```cpp
12:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> __int8 hud;
12:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> __int8 sat;
12:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> __int8 lig;
12:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> __int8 alp;
12:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> int hsla[4] = {hud, sat, lig, alp};
12:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> ```
12:10 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> boyeeeee
12:11 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> __int8 is 8 bit integers
12:12 < bridge> <learath2> 0.7 has a different darkest lgt value allowed for skins, so you need to rescale
12:13 < bridge> <learath2> The 3 function calls are trivial, I'm 90% sure any competent compiler won't even bother with a function and inline them
12:15 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> how can i assemble and access it tho ?
12:15 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i have skill issue in c++
12:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> learn then
12:17 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i'm learning here
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> search on google
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> how cpp classes and structs work
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> it will be more efficient for u
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> and us
12:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ask chatgpt
12:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:17 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> can't access it in iran
12:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> skill issue
12:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> start revolution
12:18 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> they block all the iran phone numbers
12:19 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i don't ask here so you can post meme ðŸ˜‚
12:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> wat xd
12:20 < ChillerDragon> imagine yielding ur phone num to ai anyways
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/12/29/france-warns-very-high-terrorism-threat-new-years-eve/
12:21 < bridge> <ryozuki> careful out there
13:13 < bridge> <chairn> ah yes, the usual maths on internet
13:14 < bridge> <chairn> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38806270
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah switch to firefox, the browser that is always 10 years behind in features xD
13:15 < bridge> <kekomonter> Buy virtual number and use VPN
13:15 < bridge> <chairn> such as?
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> "it's much more common for me to encounter a website that works in firefox but not chrome than the other way around. "
13:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> the first comment is so gold
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> in what universe does this human live
13:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> webrtc is worse in firefox, webgl sucks hard, webgpu is still much more beta
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> firefox is slower in most stuff
13:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> list is long
13:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> but nobody uses webgl for most stuff
13:17 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> anyone here who wants to use chatgpt, using this method :owo:
13:17 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but i don't care about ai
13:17 < bridge> <chairn> i don't think most website uses these
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there is more
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> firefox has no PWA, the UI is worse(subjective). firefox mobile is trash (some addons are really good, but the overall experience is bad)
13:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> firefox shows ads on their home site
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> firefox is also the underdog, which means they will never set the state of art. they always have to implement what chrome etc implement
13:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> so they can't really be innovative, except over specs
13:20 < bridge> <chairn> pwa ?
13:21 < bridge> <milkeeycat> progressive web applications? xd
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yes
13:21 < bridge> <chairn> so you'd be in favor of a monopoly of chrome & google on the internet ?
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> basically use websites as electron apps ðŸ˜‚
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i am in favour of having the state of art. and firefox is simply too far behind
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> there was a time where firefox was the monopoly of internet browsers
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and they fucked it up
13:22 < bridge> <chairn> and what do you need state of the art browser for?
13:22 < bridge> <chairn> never?
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> firefox 3.6
13:22 < bridge> <chairn> having more than 50% doesn't mean monopoly
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> well at least they had the power to be innovative
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and they didnt use it
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> imagine we'd still use flash today instead of html5
13:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> lmao
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @ryozuki https://ruffle.rs/
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> really good already
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i can play some old flash games with it already
13:26 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜„
13:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> epyc
15:12 < bridge> <davide55> Oh ðŸ˜„
15:13 < bridge> <davide55> It must be added on @deen side
16:06 < bridge> <learath2> Fwiw, I've only ever had issues with ancient govt websites that only run on ie6
16:09 < bridge> <learath2> Probably. Most people don't care until it's way too late
16:24 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Chillerdragon had issues with webrtc using discord voice chat. It doesn't support noise filtering. I'd claim that's a big issue already
16:31 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i also have some problems with firefox when try to use voicechat :justatest: but in chrome everything works fine
16:34 < bridge> <milkeeycat> btw, is it ok that hook like shows that i can hook through blocks and i actually cant
16:44 < bridge> <learath2> I think it's fine. We use the length of the hook as if acting on another tee, which is a little longer than it is when acting on a tile
16:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> i mean, it shows i can hook thru but its only possible to hook to purple circle
16:48 < bridge> <milkeeycat> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1190682933477003395/image.png?ex=65a2b0e5&is=65903be5&hm=f6050021480111a8d1f23fbfe75e0046c11eb886ec5620c94392ea17d61e1ebe&

16:58 < bridge> <learath2> Oh this one looks wrong, hm
17:03 < bridge> <furo321> I think this is because we use mouse position instead of TargetXY for hookcoll.
17:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is this a bug or a feature?
17:06 < bridge> <furo321> Well, it used to use TargetXY. but it got changed in this PR: <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4760>.
17:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hi bros
17:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> broadcast make some time to clear from the screen, how can i clear it sooner ?
17:39 < bridge> <robyt3> Send an empty broadcast to override it
17:42 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> also is there a bool to indicate if any broadcast is currently showen on the players screen ?
17:43 < bridge> <robyt3> No, you'd have to remember when the broadcast when sent and check if that's longer ago than the broadcast time
17:43 < bridge> <robyt3> No, you'd have to remember when the broadcast was sent and check if that's longer ago than the broadcast time
18:00 < bridge> <teeffs> noooo, i forgot to push the binary, I originally wanted to use it to save TeeBall's binary!!
18:02 < ChillerDragon> ?? wat binary
18:02 < bridge> <teeffs> noooo, i forgot to push the binary, I originally wanted to use it to save TeeBall!!
18:02 < bridge> <teeffs> but i only found the binary
18:05 < bridge> <teeffs> noooo, i forgot it
18:05 < bridge> <teeffs> I forgot it, that 3 years ago
18:05 < ChillerDragon> ??
18:05 < bridge> <teeffs> I forgot that 3 years ago
18:05 < bridge> <teeffs> sorry idk what to say TuT, i create that repo 3 years ago
18:06 < ChillerDragon> what repo
18:06 < ChillerDragon> who are you talking to?
18:06 < bridge> <teeffs> -- ChillerDragon @Anime-pdf trol empty repo https://github.com/TeeworldsFun/teeworlds-teeball
18:06 < bridge> <teeffs> i reply it
18:06 < ChillerDragon> aaa
18:06 < ChillerDragon> yea i dont see replies sorry
18:06 < ChillerDragon> so you replied to my message
18:07 < bridge> <teeffs> yes yes
18:07 < ChillerDragon> i see
18:07 < ChillerDragon> sad
18:07 < ChillerDragon> binary is boring anyways code would be more interesting
18:09 < ChillerDragon> @teeffs so 3yrs ago you had it and now its gone? ._.
18:09 < bridge> <teeffs> its probably gone
18:09 < ChillerDragon> rip
18:10 < bridge> <teeffs> Interestingly, I used a web time machine to browse FuN's website at that time, but R.I.P.

18:32 < ChillerDragon> everyone ready for new years copyright commits?
18:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: `SSLKEYLOGFILE`
19:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no? ^^ all devs seem to want accounts
19:07 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> i heard about the meetup ðŸ˜„ - how was it?
19:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> custom clients are allowed, cheats not
19:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what does it do instead of restarting the stream when it detects an error?
19:24 < ChillerDragon> > You are using either the Firefox or Chrome browsers on the client system to access a web application.
19:24 < ChillerDragon> SSLKEYLOGFILE seems to be browser only
19:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> all is a strong word. I think even jopsti is pro ddnet accounts but only if done right. He does not even have an account on kog.
19:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://docs.rs/crate/tracing/latest/features it has features to disable it (even completely, check `max_level_off`. it needs `-O1` to be zero-cost, I think)
19:38 < ChillerDragon> okay i kinda got SSLKEYLOGFILE working but its not smooth enough for me to be useful
19:41 < bridge> <avolicious> An invalid tag so it crashes
19:42 < bridge> <avolicious> If a stream got cancelled by the server, you cant just restart it afaik. You have to re-init the stream itself, not the connection
19:53 < bridge> <zwelf2> Was great meeting fellow Tees at the 34c3. Thanks for stopping by. I was surprised how many Tees showed up :D.
19:53 < bridge> <zwelf2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1190729507326410762/37c3-meetup.jpeg?ex=65a2dc45&is=65906745&hm=132145e6609b0626d12a1a8db6a8bab039b6517d8f90d5b465883631089eb112&
19:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: for "a" vs "an", always check whether the next word, **when spoken**, starts with a vowel. that means "hour" starts with a vowel, but "university" does not.
19:54 < bridge> <zwelf2> For anyone who wants to meet, the next opportunity is at https://fosdem.org/2024 (cc @chillerdragon)
19:55 < ChillerDragon> c: thanks for the ping but seems like my next free slot would be 2025
19:56 < ChillerDragon> okay "hour" starts with "o" but doesnt "university" start with "u" ?
19:57 < ChillerDragon> @zwelf2 wait wot ppl showed up?
19:58 < bridge> <zwelf2> +
19:58 < ChillerDragon> ppl u didnt know?
19:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> why do you play from 0.7? ^^
19:58 < ChillerDragon> me?
19:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> a fudgy
19:59 < bridge> <fudgy_> It feels smoother, I just like it
20:00 < bridge> <fudgy_> And I added some changes locally that I like
20:00 < ChillerDragon> @zwelf2 i somehow can not believe ppl u did not know and did not expect coming that actually play the game showed up
20:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> fudgy sus
20:00 < bridge> <fudgy_> I dont play ddrace so I dont need ddnet client
20:02 < bridge> <zwelf2> Yes, some. Some I knew only by name, some I had played with. Some old players (one who wrote a DDRace mod back in the days) that I didn't know. A Teeworlds player that wasn't aware of DDNet. In total we were ~10 I believe. (2 unrelated to Teeworlds/DDNet also showed up).
20:02 < ChillerDragon> no fucking way
20:02 < ChillerDragon> dude i really missed something there
20:03 < ChillerDragon> "A Teeworlds player that wasn't aware of DDNet" love it 
20:03 < ChillerDragon> this is why 0.7 compat matters
20:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> please don't do that with other people's projectsâ€¦
20:04 < bridge> <zwelf2> Yeah, I think he tried Teeworlds a few years ago again, when DDNet didn't had 0.7 compat.
20:06 < ChillerDragon> dood heinrich chill ryo was just cyber bullying me a bit
20:06 < ChillerDragon> its his real opinion but it was clearly a joke
20:06 < ChillerDragon> pls dont turn #developer into a joke free zone heinrich ._.
20:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you could debug why, it'd be interesting ^^
20:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's supposed to be a zone void of lazy negativity
20:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> which I think this was an example of
20:09 < ChillerDragon> teeworlds is much more lightweight than ddnet
20:09 < ChillerDragon> it has way less features
20:11 < bridge> <baumwollee> Thank you guys for organizing :) was fun
20:11 < ChillerDragon> meetup leak!
20:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> shouldn't impact performance
20:11 < bridge> <zwelf2> Was great meeting fellow Tees at the 37c3. Thanks for stopping by. I was surprised how many Tees showed up :D.

20:14 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 im not sure "feels smoother" has to be raw fps or something like that. Alone the start/quit time and the cleaner menu has a lot feel to it.
20:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> dragon: time ./teeworlds quit
20:15 < ChillerDragon> ``time teeworlds quit`` real 0.7s
20:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> no way
20:15 < ChillerDragon> not in 4k
20:15 < ChillerDragon> on my fullhd laptop
20:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> `./target/release/ddnet-playground quit  0,21s user 0,16s system 209% cpu 0,177 total`
20:15 < ChillerDragon> ``time DDNet quit`` 4.3s
20:15 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> it got faster
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but it's unfair, your pc is faster
20:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> dragonball: can u do me a favor and test it on your pc?
20:17 < ChillerDragon> IMO alone the non teeish textures used in the ddnet main menu are a valid reason to switch to vanilla client
20:17 < ChillerDragon> jupjapyopstinger: i am im bulgaria meeting bulgariantee xd
20:17 < ChillerDragon> @Axi when meet mf
20:17 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> but u have fullhd laptop?
20:18 < ChillerDragon> oh by pc u mean my laptop?
20:18 < ChillerDragon> run ur rust code?
20:18 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah, u open to test?
20:18 < ChillerDragon> yea but i kinda wanna go to bed since like 1 hour xd
20:18 < ChillerDragon> lez do tmrw
20:19 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah but doesnt matter
20:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> was just quirious if it feels good, if someone other than extremly biased me runs it
20:20 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> wow my english is good
20:21 < ChillerDragon> quirious
20:21 < ChillerDragon> reads fine in my brain
20:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ikr
20:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> language is understanding each other
20:22 < ChillerDragon> everything feels sleepy rn
20:22 < ChillerDragon> ill do feelsgoodman test tomorrow after coffee
20:22 < ChillerDragon> if i dont forget
20:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> yeah yeah no pressure
20:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i'd upload cur version then anyway
21:08 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> is the sounds on protocol.h like: SOUND_GUN_FIRE, is the only sounds that i can use on my server or there is more ?
21:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: remind me what the differencese between 0.7 and ddnet menu are
21:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess we could try to optimize startup time ðŸ™‚
21:57 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ladies, gentlemen and other creatures as well. im proud to show u my milk lang interpreter(if u type in a number, it returns number) ðŸŽ‰

21:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> cool ðŸ™‚
21:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is the source code public somewhere?
21:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> suuuure https://github.com/Milk-Interpreters/milk_interpreter_go
23:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> its a calculator with a null :justatest:

23:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice name xd
23:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> call generators cows
23:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> or smth
23:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> pointers
23:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> call pointers cows
23:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> cows point to milk
23:09 < bridge> <Ewan> in pxtone u have to call Moo() to create 1 frame of audio
23:49 < bridge> <milkeeycat> No pointers jn milklang, pointers hard. It has only arithmetic on numbers, booleans, null. Functions and variables are coming
23:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> nice
23:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> add a llvm jit backend
23:51 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Sounds complicated as fuck. I making a lang for grugs. I liked writing a lexer as well as parser
23:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> u would love lalrpop
23:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> its so easy
23:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> well until u hit a reduce reduce problem
23:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> there is also chumsky
23:52 < bridge> <milkeeycat> After i finish the book ill try to make it in rust
23:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky
23:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> this lib is for parsers
23:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> with pretty errors
