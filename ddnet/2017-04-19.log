13:48 < Socialdarwinist> You could make it possible to mark and paste text in the F1 console, so one can copy URLs thence. Then there are no misclick.
13:49 < Socialdarwinist> Mark, copy and paste it elsewhere, I mean of course.
15:33 <@deen> sure, someone could do that
15:46 <@deen> but it feels like that should be a standard feature provided by sdl2 or some higher level lib
15:47 < Socialdarwinist> I do not need it myself though. Because I am starting DDNet by a .desktop file I have made that has the line Terminal=true, so I can always copy from the terminal emulator.
15:49 <@deen> yeah, same here. but on windows no idea
15:49 < Socialdarwinist> @deen Is everybody doin his own .desktop file here?
15:50 <@deen> no, i mean I just run ./DDNet from terminal
15:50 <@deen> I don't mind having dozens of terminals around
15:51 <@EastByte> what's a desktop? :p
15:52 <@deen> the black screen you see before you fill your 20 workspaces with terminals
15:52 < Ryozuki> xD
15:58 < Socialdarwinist> .Desktop files appear in your start menu and you can write it into them that the program start in a terminal: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#recognized-keys
15:58 < Socialdarwinist> Maybe we should put my .desktop file somewhere into the repository or the website repository, so everyone can put it into their ~/.local/share/applications, just editing the exec path according to the path he saves his DDNet client? The .desktop file even has localized description lines. I just do not know whither to put it. On TeeUniverse necropotame has integrated it into CMake, but it is also not perfectly done, and of 
15:58 < Socialdarwinist> course requires a “make install”: https://github.com/teeuniverse/teeuniverse/commit/1d0acd6e900460913e1ba2ecd88d413bf78d56e4
16:09 <@deen> interesting: https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=5137
16:15 < Ryozuki> and these bugs should be fixed?
16:15 < Ryozuki> this is a interesting thing of the game, usually on the other games they would be fixed
16:15 < Ryozuki> but here they allow weird gameplay
16:17 < Ryozuki> the kill immunity one, i didn't heard of it
16:17 < Ryozuki> but looks like it rly shoud be fixed
16:17 < Ryozuki> should*
16:52 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Learath2 opened pull request #742: Add mod name to ban reason (master...dd_pr_accountability) https://git.io/vSplJ
17:20 <@heinrich5991> I don't understand the kill immunity one in the end, about joining team 0
17:21 <@heinrich5991> Ryozuki: kill immunity was introduced so you don't die when you go through the finish line and the mapper has kill tiles immediately after them
