00:20 <+o_be_one> hop, updates r0x.TW servers to add name in title :D
00:21 <+o_be_one> updated scripts to be able to deal with it
02:30 < IcyFoxy> CHN ddnet server offline.
02:33 < IcyFoxy> Back up.
02:38 < IcyFoxy> Crashed again...
03:19 <@deen> IcyFoxy: bad but not much we can do
03:20 < IcyFoxy> deen: Any idea what was causing?
03:23 <@deen> not really, probably network or hoster problems
04:01 < IcyFoxy> Hmm
04:01 < IcyFoxy> Are you seeing any status of the server going up/down through monitoring scripts?
04:02 < IcyFoxy> Also do teams that timeout return as a team or where they at least were up to?
04:02 < IcyFoxy> (timeout protection)
04:04 <@deen> only this: https://ddnet.tw/status/
04:05 <@deen> your tee stays ingame and you just get it back with timeout protection
04:46 < IcyFoxy> deen: Cool.
04:46 < IcyFoxy> So the team doesn't die. Very cool
04:46 < IcyFoxy> Just noticed a nice bug there...
04:46 < IcyFoxy> I like. ;)
04:46 <@deen> ?
04:46 < IcyFoxy> Swap timeout tokens with your partner, and swap places :D
04:47 <@deen> Yep
04:47 <@deen> People use that a lot
04:47 < IcyFoxy> That really needs to be a client and server feature :P
04:47 < IcyFoxy> Neat
04:47 <@deen> Well, it's not supposed to be a feature
04:47 < IcyFoxy> I like this bug as a feature :P
04:47 < IcyFoxy> I was actually thinking about a /shuffle command on the server I'm writing :
04:47 < IcyFoxy> :P
04:48 < IcyFoxy> Before today ^
04:49  * IcyFoxy is just watching a few friends flying through the walls on the server now as I experience some extreme lag XD
05:27 < IcyFoxy> deen: Is there any chance that I could host a ddnet server locally and still get ranked for my results? 
05:27 < IcyFoxy> Especially right now - lag spikes and latency is unbarable.. :/
05:49 <@deen> IcyFoxy: no, unfortunately not. the new admins had plans for this kind of thing, but I don't think anything materialized
06:00 < IcyFoxy> deen: Through a public ranking submission API?
06:01 < IcyFoxy> I think that would still need some auth tokens such that for instance, any ranks submitted by party X (like myself) could be revoked in case of abuse / cheating.
09:09 < IcyFoxy> Ouch... Near the end of a map and ddnet client just crashed...
09:09 < IcyFoxy> TIP: Do not scroll out too far...
09:12 < IcyFoxy> Ouch
09:12 < IcyFoxy> And settings wiped so no timeout protection.......
09:13 < IcyFoxy> Any chance someone can join and teleport me back to my race? :/
09:14 < IcyFoxy> deen: ?
09:15 < IcyFoxy> Almost 200 minutes in, practicly at the finish line...
09:20 < IcyFoxy> 165 minutes. Gone because client crash
09:22 < IcyFoxy> Surprising how long the timeout protection keeps my tees alive.. o.o
09:25 < IcyFoxy> timeout protection finally over heh
09:25 < IcyFoxy> 15 minutes
10:41 <@EastByte> Why did you wipe the configuration right after client crash?
10:41 <@EastByte> IcyFoxy:
11:29 < IcyFoxy> EastByte: I didn't. But it was the first launch on this boot (livecd); and it only writes the config on normal exit.
11:30 < IcyFoxy> And right now the chinese server is under attack (seemingly) various tees hav timed out, and the game is not playable
11:31 < IcyFoxy> Ultra lag, as if the server is possibly trying to talk to hundreds of clients trying to connect / ddos is my guess.
11:33 < IcyFoxy> The /status says the chinese sserver is offline, but I'm (and others) connected.
11:39 < IcyFoxy> 3 more clients disconnected
