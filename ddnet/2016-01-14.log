17:27 < goto_die> hey guys, what could be a reason for a server that is not showing up in the masterserver? (no bann, ports are okay)
17:27 <+o_be_one> mmh
17:27 <+o_be_one> got this with game server from ovh
17:28 <+o_be_one> logs was "no firewall problem" but the game was unreachable by players
17:28 < goto_die> server can be reached by connect via ip
17:28 < goto_die> but masterserver does not showing up them
17:29 <+o_be_one> weird cause i had servers with just the udp game port opened, only that, no icmp or other thing, and it was ok
17:29 < goto_die> do you think it is a problem with ovh?
17:30 < goto_die> because one master server may be down I only find 949 servers in the list
17:37 <+o_be_one> idk goto_die , i think its not a problem from ovh
17:37 <+o_be_one> it could be if you have a game server
17:37 <+o_be_one> game dedi
17:38 < goto_die> this sucks, don't want to change my hoster because of things like this
17:41 <+o_be_one> you have a game dedi ?
17:41 < goto_die> I donutliekspekingliekthis sry
17:42 < goto_die> It's a Vserver
17:42 <+o_be_one> k
17:42 <+o_be_one> at nfo ?
17:43 < goto_die> ovh
17:43 <+o_be_one> vserver ? you mean a vps ?
17:43 <+o_be_one> vps-ssd ?
17:45 < goto_die> what does a ssd have to do with my problem
17:46 <+o_be_one> i'm just asking what kind of vps you have
17:47 <+o_be_one> i have one vps-ssd host, no problem with it
17:47 <+o_be_one> i have one dedi game, no problem with it
17:47 <+o_be_one> i have one cloud, no problem with it
17:47 <+o_be_one> (all 3 hosts TW servers)
17:47 < goto_die> at ovh?
17:48 <+o_be_one> yup
17:48 < goto_die> wich masterserver are you using?
17:49 < goto_die> o.o my server now shows up without doing anything ._.
17:51 <+o_be_one> mmh defaut master
17:51 <+o_be_one> no ?
17:53 < goto_die> thanks for your help, just forget about it 
17:53 <@deen> goto_die: which mastersrv is your server picking?
17:53 <@deen> I noticed some problems with the mastersrvs in the last days
17:54 <@deen> it should say in the log which one it's choosing
17:54 <@deen> and unfortunately the server tends to choose the same one all the time
17:57 < Ryozuki> hi
17:57 < Ryozuki> hi Soreu 
17:59 < goto_die> my server is picking up server 2
18:00 < Henningstone> this is the only available master :\
18:00 < Henningstone> https://www.teeworlds.com/?status=1
18:00 < goto_die> are this attacks on the mastersrv?
18:01 < Henningstone> no, there is only one master for a few weeks now, I think
18:03 < goto_die> this sucks
18:57 < goto_die> now it disappeared again, hoping for a fix that actually works
19:15 <@deen> no, master4 is GER and it's up
19:49 < Ryozuki> so basically tw is down
19:50 < Ryozuki> but ddnet not
19:50 < Ryozuki> no*
19:50 < Ryozuki> ddnet masterserver
19:50 < Ryozuki> oh
19:50 < Ryozuki> there are also other servers
19:58 < goto_die> @deen how do I tell my server wich masterserver he should choose?
