09:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I guess ddnet doesn't maintain or develop block servers
09:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But you could request them to host a ddnet++ server :troll:
09:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <à¸¿Ó¾â± Ó¾â±¤> ik, but if someone wants to do it
10:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> There won't be block features in ddnet even if someone opens a pr i guess.
10:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> You would have to request ddnet to host another mod.
