10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis btw ever tested a newer driver? Is there even a single driver that worked for you?
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i just wonder if its even a GPU problem, or the fact that its always a laptop
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis btw ever tested a newer driver? Is there even a single driver that worked for you? (and i specifically mean the exact freeze problem, not another)
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Optimus is a big mess, maybe that's where sth goes wrong
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is it people with dGPUs aswell? Maybe they could try forcing one gpu
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it happens for 1 person that also has a nvidia iirc, but i dunno if louis even has dual gpu
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (above to be clear, he is using intel)
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (above to be clear, he is using intel, he just also has a NVidia)
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> no way to change this disgusting brown?

16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what color do you prefer, your name doesnt look much different
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe some nicer, lighter shade of orange, current is diarrhea color
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/client/graphics_threaded.cpp#L691
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> color is rgba normalized
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> let's go with `ColorRGBA{1.0f, 0.6f, 0.3f, 1.0f});`
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> that's probably me
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wasnt ur problem, that you can only run 32bit for some reason 😄
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> He could run 64bit but then it wouldn't use his gpu for some reason
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but does he also have problems with his intel?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or was it just, that his nvidia runs more smooth
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I actually don't remember sorry
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i can run on intel but nvidia is way more smooth
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> could you change design of tune zone , zoom out is very bad !
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <texnonik> could you change design of tune zone , zoom out is very bad ! ( playing with it to )
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how is it bad, bad looking?
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://fasterthanli.me/articles/pin-and-suffering
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a long blog post, but worth it if u like rust
19:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Masterizer2> Hey guys, is there a way I can submit a request for noby's fng mod ?
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> discord.gg/utB4Rs3
19:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> ask here
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝖄𝖔𝖚𝖓𝖊𝖘𝖉𝖊𝖛𝖎𝖑> Why DDNet Persian server is down?
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ddos
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://xkcd.com/356/
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 :PepeA:
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/825807132216655872/unknown.png
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 is that the oficial repo? i think they used mercurial before
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess they ported it
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw if u ever need windowing in rust i recommend the rust native <https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit> instead of using sdl
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> altho its scope is not as broad as sdl
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it even supports webassembly :PepeA:
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen you think its possible that the game may froze due to it downloading some skin or smth?
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sometimes it freezes for like 5-10 seconds since 15.3 iirc
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rly dont know why
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that should be async
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but a few ppl said 15.4 sometimes drops frames, but not a real freeze
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im talking a real hard freeze
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i didnt experience any freeze yet
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but just the game
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> what you mean?
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> both aur ddnet and steam ddnet have this
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just the game?
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not the sound or what?
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the game becomes unresponsive
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm idk about the sound
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> brb
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> back
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> wb
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so we have freezes, hangs, fps drops
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but most ppl dont have it xd
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> they decided it's not worth using some arcane VCS that only 10 people use with a shitty unmaintained web ui
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Ryozuki can you add a FAQ section to the wiki, so we can add question we think that are asked often
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> (next time they are asked xd)
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why you ask me
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can add them yourself
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats the point of the wiki
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> didnt know its a public wiki
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm about to watch the last episode of AOT
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so exciting
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its moderated until u make some good edits
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then u can edit all u want
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aka, u make a edit and we accept it
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw there is already this https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/Common_Terminology
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i guess its not as broad as what u want
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah, its not gameplay related
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 im learning how to use perf to show me stats every 10 seconds
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> perf stat -a -I 10000
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> perf is extremely cute
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you can also get it to record into a ringbuffer which you can get it to dump with SIGUSR1
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> minimal overhead too so great for diagnosing momentary performance issues
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it kinda doesi t
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/825820544293142538/unknown.png
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i want to see function names
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ what u want me to add there
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do u have any solved question already
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no nvm, i just thought about a startting point like title header and stuff
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar ✪ https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/FAQ
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i just need an account?
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or do u have to add me somewhere?
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> an account
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u tell me the name i can add u to the group that doesnt need moderation
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://wiki.ddnet.tw/wiki/How_to_contribute
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my english needs moderation
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no worries thats fixed by other ppl when they check the page and that
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and find errors*
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadly it looks like nobody contributes anyway
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> my name is EinloggenNervt
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok done
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> hoster was hacked, hoster stopped responding to support tickets 😄
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> wrong
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki hm, don't see how the skin dl would do that, weird. 5-10 sec is really long
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> rip
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝖄𝖔𝖚𝖓𝖊𝖘𝖉𝖊𝖛𝖎𝖑> Very strange🙃
23:53 <+bridge> [freenode] <kamillentee[m]> How can we add articles in different languages to ddnet wiki?
