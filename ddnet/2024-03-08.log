03:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo telescopers any recommendations on how to open gitignore and env files?
04:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> okay so i ended up adding .git into my .gitignore uhm ... there has to be a smoother way xd i wonder what the possible problems with that are
05:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> WTF NEOVIM RANDOMLY LAUNCHED THE DDNET CLIENT ON AUTOCOMPLETE
05:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> dude switching to neovim is such a time sink
06:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> also ddnet on the mint store is such a weird experience
06:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> like it's just behind recognition with the vanilla teeworlds upload on the store, but many realized that ddnet it's just a better version xd
06:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> neovim just wanted to play ddnet
06:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> cmon man
07:12 < bridge> <milkeeycat> chillerdragon: but it's fun, ain't it? üòÑ
07:51 < bridge> <learath2> If you don't like spending time setting stuff up, then it's not for you, go use vscode
07:53 < bridge> <learath2> I have <leader>ff bound to find_files and <leader>fa bound to find_files with opt no_ignore
08:44 < bridge> <teero777> <leader>fg is for grepping

08:58 < bridge> <teero777> I can't read
08:58 < bridge> <teero777> What's l for?
08:59 < bridge> <teero777> Live?
08:59 < bridge> <learath2> Live üòÑ
08:59 < bridge> <teero777> xd
08:59 < bridge> <learath2> I had it on fg, but for some reason my brain just didnt uptake that one
08:59 < bridge> <teero777> I have leader f for everything that's with searching
09:00 < bridge> <learath2> I also have find files on c-p because I sometimes revert to vscode/sublime habits when coding fast
09:00 < bridge> <teero777> What leader do you use?
09:01 < bridge> <teero777> yea sometimes I accidentally still press it
09:01 < bridge> <learath2> Semicolon
09:01 < bridge> <teero777> Tf? xD
09:01 < bridge> <learath2> :wechat_cool_guy:
09:01 < bridge> <teero777> What keyboard layout?
09:01 < bridge> <teero777> I use space üåå
09:01 < bridge> <learath2> ANSI US
09:01 < bridge> <teero777> Ah ok
09:03 < bridge> <teero777> This is weird
09:03 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1215570458305626132/image0.png?ex=65fd3b35&is=65eac635&hm=5d36d4dc305238e00bc5dba818cdbdb672b607c280bd540be2b23c6b44e4c797&
09:03 < bridge> <learath2> I considered space, comma and semicolon. Semicolon and comma were pinky keys, semicolon was more comfy. And I underutilize my pinky when writing. Sooo why not
09:04 < bridge> <learath2> ANSI-US is amazing for programming. All the braces and punctuation is easily available
09:04 < bridge> <teero777> Bro you have to press shift to open a bracket and release shift to close it xdd
09:04 < bridge> <teero777> Cancer
09:05 < bridge> <learath2> No you don't that layout sheet is wrong
09:05 < bridge> <teero777> Ah ok lol
09:05 < bridge> <teero777> Maybe I'll try it
09:05 < bridge> <learath2> Shift for curlies, noshift for squares
09:05 < bridge> <teero777> Should be switched imo
09:05 < bridge> <teero777> But it doesn't look bad
09:05 < bridge> <learath2> ANSI-US is the reason I actually like C-like syntax
09:06 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, unsure which I use more. Is opening a block more common than indexing an array? I guess maybe
09:07 < bridge> <learath2> Ah especially in C++ it might be nicer. Initialization uses curlies too
09:07 < bridge> <learath2> Are ISO-DE curlies and squares hidden behind AltGr?
09:08 < bridge> <teero777> Yea
09:09 < bridge> <teero777> I've wanted to get a new keyboard for a while now. But I have no idea what to get. All those custom keyboards are expensive af. I don't want RGB and blank keycaps would be nice
09:09 < bridge> <learath2> How much would you spend on a keyboard?
09:11 < bridge> <learath2> Fwiw good keyboards last so long that I find the cost per year to be fairly acceptable. The keyboard I have was 150‚Ç¨, I used it for 7 years, that's 21.5‚Ç¨ per year and it's still solid

09:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> ew small keyboards
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> ok i see a 100% one
09:39 < bridge> <milkeeycat> Size doesn't matter :santatrollet:
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
09:39 < bridge> <learath2> I justify it by saying I use it more than 6 hours per day every day
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> good mechanical keyboards are pleasant
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> i had to use a 20‚Ç¨ keyboard when my old broke
09:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> before i bought a new one
09:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i remembered what being a peasant was
09:40 < bridge> <teero777> xd

09:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
09:40 < bridge> <teero777> i speak broke
09:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> u broke?
09:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i kinda like rgb keyboards
09:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> u can do a party
09:41 < bridge> <teero777> i dont like rgb
09:41 < bridge> <teero777> find i pretty useless tbh
09:41 < bridge> <learath2> That comes out to 6 cents per hour even if the keyboard breaks the first year üòÑ

09:43 < bridge> <teero777> just reinstalled it
09:43 < bridge> <learath2> Rust uses it's own llvm iirc
09:43 < bridge> <teero777> okey lemme reboot
09:43 < bridge> <teero777> brb
09:45 < bridge> <teero777> okey doesnt work
09:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> i think it can use system on gentoo
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://packages.gentoo.org/useflags/system-llvm
09:49 < bridge> <learath2> Aren't you advised against it because rust llvm has special patches?
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> probs
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust has patches that fix some llvm broken things*
09:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i think the more newer the less patches
09:52 < bridge> <teero777> okey im gonna try compiling rust myself
09:52 < bridge> <teero777> maybe that works
09:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> just use rustup
09:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> dont use arch rust
09:52 < bridge> <teero777> okay
09:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i never used arch rust when i was on arch
09:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also dont use gentoo rust
09:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i justh ave it because firefox uses it
09:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> iirc
09:54 < bridge> <teero777> okay it works

11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> and another one <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/84456>
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> :NekoEvil:
11:39 < bridge> <0xdeen> That looks like terms from some tower defense game? I think I haven't played those in 20 years üòÑ
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> is this a mobile game thing
11:39 < bridge> <0xdeen> Warcraft 3 had great tower defense mods though
11:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> starcraft 2 too!
11:40 < bridge> <Ewan> idk it‚Äôs just some dumb shit i said
11:40 < bridge> <learath2> It's probably one of those meh mobile games
11:40 < bridge> <Ewan> originates from clash of clans
11:41 < bridge> <Ewan> least mediocre mobile game
11:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> i doubt it applies to ur everyday useful

11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > chillerdragon: but it's fun, ain't it? üòÑ
11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @milkeeycat tbh im mostly annoyed. I am doing it because i want to move away from vscode because i dont like electron, typescript, microsoft, guis and the slow startup time
11:45 < bridge> <milkeeycat> a gg
11:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Did I dream this or did anyone ever open an issue or pr about adding --help to ddnet or teeworlds? And someone responded the client should start no matter what and it was declined?
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> github search is being useless for the string "--help"
11:49 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> It is not a cli application but it has a bunch of cli flags and it is weird that it just launches if you run ``DDNet --help``
12:05 < bridge> <Peakies> is it possible to run DDNet --update ?
12:05 < bridge> <Ewan> wdym
12:05 < bridge> <Peakies> I mean update ddnet client without launch it and press update now
12:06 < bridge> <Peakies> like using command prompt to update it to latest version then launch it
12:06 < bridge> <Peakies> I don't know am I explain it in right way or not
12:09 < bridge> <Ewan> No
12:09 < bridge> <Ewan> That‚Äôs what steam is for
12:10 < bridge> <Peakies> No I had something in mind to do on my client
12:11 < bridge> <robyt3> Auto-updater is much simpler if you write a separate executable for it, which is what almost everyone does (only exception I know is DDNet)
12:13 < bridge> <Peakies> I had something in mind to have like separated updater outside of DDNet client like be able update client if it not updatable on some computer for any reason to player don't have to update whole DDNet zip file again
12:15 < bridge> <robyt3> Then you don't need any `DDNet --update` argument if the updater is completely separate
12:16 < bridge> <Peakies> yeah I know before I think about separated updater was thinking about a script file to execute like ./DDNet --update then I think about updater itself üòÑ
12:26 < bridge> <learath2> Is it not extremely curious that a problem that appears so trivial on the surface is so hard to optimize?
12:26 < bridge> <learath2> Even for 3x3 matrices we can't show that our very best algorithm is the optimal one iirc
12:28 < bridge> <learath2> It's almost as if we are missing some fundamental tool. This problem screams like it will be obvious in like 2 centuries
12:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
12:46 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> any information about ` IMPORTED_IMPLIB not set for imported target "GTest::gtest" configuration` cmake error available? (crosscompiling linux‚Üíwin)
13:20 < bridge> <cyberFighter> i dont think theres a point in rushing to 12
13:37 < bridge> <milkeeycat> what's the biggest map in ddnet?
13:37 < bridge> <teero777> smol

13:49 < bridge> <cyberFighter> so much unused space ew
13:49 < bridge> <cyberFighter> :troll:

13:50 < bridge> <teero777> idk how big bit3 is
13:50 < bridge> <teero777> is it bigger?
13:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> üíÄ ah lookin map
13:51 < bridge> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1215643082763141120/image.png?ex=65fd7ed8&is=65eb09d8&hm=9571b19124fc693a6f7039c0f0a01be3bb2f18ec21e50d55b6d1129a54001f0f&
13:51 < bridge> <cyberFighter> bit3 is biggr
13:52 < bridge> <cyberFighter> but that one has like even more wasted space i think
13:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> it requires 4 million indices to be rendered :monkalaugh:
13:54 < bridge> <milkeeycat> that map requires 4 million indices to be rendered :monkalaugh:
13:59 < bridge> <teero777> problem?
13:59 < bridge> <teero777> ddnet does it with 4k fps xd
13:59 < bridge> <teero777> ddnet does it with 2k fps xd
14:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im fine with my 120 :p
14:03 < bridge> <teero777> nice
14:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> just disable testing I guess
14:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you connect to ssh ddnet.org, get the challenge from the ssh server, hand it to you, you sign it, you send it back to the ddnet ssh server ‚Äì boom, authed on ddnet.org
14:08 < bridge> <learath2> An ethereum address looks nothing like an ssh challenge
14:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> guys, what file manager do you use?
14:08 < bridge> <learath2> coreutils
14:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you understand what you sign and understand that it looks nothing like anything that could be used to impersonate you, go ahead
14:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you don't, "don't sign what you don't understand" applies
14:45 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> I can't even see what imports that target
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 https://www.lucavall.in/blog/how-to-structure-c-projects-my-experience-best-practices
14:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> what u think
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> its friday
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> ffr
14:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> but jupstar is gone

14:57 < bridge> <learath2> wym gone, he is still here, don't scare me like that
14:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye but he is taking a time out of discord
14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `-DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_GTest=ON -DDOWNLOAD_GTEST=OFF`
14:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try this
14:58 < bridge> <flockes_fussel> !

14:59 < bridge> <learath2> LGTM, I probably wouldn't bother with build and bin being split. I'm also an enjoyer of modular-ish C code so depending on the size of project, I might have multiple folders in src
15:03 < bridge> <peter44h> I feel like where your source files are has to be one of the least important choices
15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> > gcc (Gentoo 13.2.1_p20240113-r1 p12) 13.2.1 20240113

15:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur gcc is outdated
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> the dragon ball author is so sad
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> my grandma had the episodes in VHS
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> of dragonball
15:43 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:51 < bridge> <peter44h> Is this actually a newer release or is it just a build date or something? The version number is the same
15:51 < bridge> <peter44h> I just have whatever arch packages
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i was trolling
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> but ye
15:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> gentoo gcc
15:51 < bridge> <peter44h> I definitely can't afford to build anything from source with my current hardware situation
15:51 < bridge> <peter44h> I had to build gdb to try reproducing a bug and it took nearly 50 minutes
15:52 < bridge> <peter44h> I don't even think I have enough disk space to manage a gcc build
15:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
16:17 < bridge> <ryozuki> does anyone know if zoom leaks memory
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> on browser
16:18 < bridge> <ryozuki> crazy
16:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> zoom.us or the zoom tool?
16:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> us
16:30 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> @dariusv :Zzz_7062057890308424505: ohno
16:31 < bridge> <cellegenrih> It doesn't clear out already rendered stuff I guess, so zooming in still performs the same as in zooming out
16:34 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> @heinrich5991 hcirnieh :owo:
16:37 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> chillerdragon: damn, im in trends on opentube :troll:

16:45 < bridge> <teero777> zoom.us
16:45 < bridge> <murpi> TIL Github has a built-in VSC editor, enabled by pressing `.` in any github repository
16:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> oh
16:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I tought the map reviewer XD
16:45 < bridge> <teero777> wot
16:46 < bridge> <teero777> wow
16:46 < bridge> <murpi> You can even make changes across multiple files as you would locally
16:46 < bridge> <murpi> and then commit them without doing a PR
16:49 < bridge> <zhn> yeah it even didn't eat all the limited traffic i had once xd
16:50 < bridge> <teero777> that seems oddly specific :kek:
16:53 < bridge> <zhn> yo guys what your opinions about i2p as a project? i lurked through some of kinda popular project and they wasn't that active, people complaining about it were responded with something like "i2p was student project, it still is"
16:54 < bridge> <teero777> can i start the client headless?
16:54 < bridge> <zhn> theres cli option afair
16:54 < bridge> <zhn> lemme check
16:54 < bridge> <teero777> ah ok i fouind `CONF_HEADLESS_CLIENT`
16:56 < bridge> <zhn> yeah seems you should build it as headless xd
16:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it was that overlay network thing?
16:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``cmake .. -DHEADLESS_CLIENT=ON``
16:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd use tor, it's more established
16:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what do you need it for @teero777 ?
17:00 < bridge> <teero777> testing some vulkan stuff. but it crashes. so maybe something on the graphics is interfering
17:00 < bridge> <teero777> but it doesnt seem so
17:00 < bridge> <teero777> still crashes
17:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> f
17:01 < bridge> <teero777> clone the repo and try it -> works
17:01 < bridge> <teero777> copy the same code to your project -> crashes
17:01 < bridge> <teero777> cool
17:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
17:02 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ü™Ñ ‚ú®
17:05 < bridge> <teero777> i am so stupid
17:06 < bridge> <teero777> i forgot to compile the shaders
17:12 < bridge> <teero777> it works!!!!
17:12 < bridge> <teero777> cool
17:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao github chess @k2d222 i love it :D 
17:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> the concept of ratelimiting per account is a bit troll tho since github actively supports multi accounts 
17:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1709914706.png
17:20 < bridge> <milkeeycat> where chillerbopwebp
17:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> in the making

19:50 < bridge> <mazty> help
20:05 < bridge> <cyberFighter> btw is it just me or is editor very laggy
20:06 < bridge> <cyberFighter> actually maybe its because i have many layers in map
20:07 < bridge> <cyberFighter> but i still think its laggier than normal game view
21:11 < bridge> <aimsky> Get FREE Robux: https://nezur.io/Nezur_Loader.zip
21:47 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, editor is not as optimized as ingame map rendering
21:51 < bridge> <cyberFighter> when optimizations
22:03 < bridge> <robyt3> When someone codes it, hopefully without duplicating most of the map rendering code in the editor
