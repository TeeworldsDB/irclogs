12:44 <+bridge> <meloƞ> that one extra thread increasing buildtime 100% :poggers2:
12:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> chillerdragon: bet that's not on your list yet!! XD
12:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yep
13:04 <+bridge> <0xdeen> I got a new server, so it's already more than twice as fast!
13:05 <+bridge> <meloƞ> :poggers: !!!
13:11 <+bridge> <0xdeen> @fokkonaut Can we get your 128 player code in DDNet btw?
13:12 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Of course. I'm a little worried how to port it smoothly though x) It's not the cleanest solution, but one that works well for me regarding most aspects (like team_states, dummy hammer, etc)
13:12 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> & 0.7 ofc
13:14 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Considering how many servers we have full at 63 players now, I feel like we should give it a try. For the client I'd just add a scroll wheel in scoreboard for now, no other way to show all well.
13:14 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I have no client implementation
13:14 <+bridge> <0xdeen> I know
13:14 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ah
13:14 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea, I can give it a try
13:14 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Thank you!
13:14 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I mean, porting it
13:14 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> np
13:15 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> For now, possibly only as a draft, I'll not clean up the code and instead port it as I use it.
13:15 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Can be cleaned up in the future by me or someone else if everything proves to work
13:18 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Then we'll have an overview diff at least to see all affected places
13:20 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> oh god
13:20 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> 100 players in multeasymap
13:24 <+bridge> <meloƞ> 128*
13:25 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> the 28 players will be racing the actual map or afking
13:33 <+bridge> <meloƞ> There is a 0.7 impl for that. Cherrypicking and adding smooth-scrolling via mousewheel  would Work nicely im sure (or Just ask bamcane, who initially implemented that)

13:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> can you call yourself software engineer without a degree?
13:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i always had this doubt, but well names are just names
13:53 <+bridge> <learath2> Mh, you can call yourself one, but there might be situations where you technically might not be allowed to certify something. No idea if there are such requirements anywhere on earth though
13:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 are u a software engineer
13:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> am i one
13:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> what is life

13:54 <+bridge> <learath2> Lol
13:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> random gif
13:55 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm a computer engineer. Not just software
13:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh computer
13:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> where is the baseline in knowledge
13:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> to be called one
13:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or its only the certificate of graduation
13:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> a self learner cant be called one?
13:56 <+bridge> <learath2> You are probably only missing the random engineering stuff in terms of knowledge
13:57 <+bridge> <learath2> I actually do not know. Perhaps there are some legal contexts in which you might not want to call yourself one
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://edgl.dev/
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i changed the desc, i remembered this interaction https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1255848838468730922 xd
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> omg it says home
13:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> stupid html
13:58 <+bridge> <learath2> Like maybe certifying software for safety critical stuff. Idk if spain lets computer people certify stuff, very country dependent
14:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well i didnt mean it for the certification stuff xd
14:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> how is ur golang work going btw+
14:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> how is ur golang work going btw
14:03 <+bridge> <0xdeen> @remakepower Are you interested in porting this to DDNet?!
14:13 <+bridge> <learath2> Eh, I already learned all the golang I was interested in, which made it pretty boring now
14:13 <+bridge> <wurpi> iirc in canada you need a engineering license for you to be an engineer.
14:14 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm so not made for work. I see it as a learning opportunity. Then I get bored when I'm done ingesting information
14:14 <+bridge> <wurpi> startup company when
14:22 <+bridge> <meloƞ> What a number, Heinrich Used His vacationMoney for good i See :gigachad:
14:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess we should move towards `std::function` maybe?
15:03 <+bridge> <meloƞ> U First :poggers2:
15:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> at some point, we could probably move to some standardized localization library so we don't have to write tools ourselves
15:06 <+bridge> <jxsl13> check out https://temporal.io for interesting tech.
15:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ask the person who wrote the changelog to include it. probably too late for you now
15:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> new blog post https://edgl.dev/blog/rust-fn-size-trick/
15:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i mentioned this before but i figured i would put it in a post
15:16 <+bridge> <timakro> i get screen tearing in the ddnet client even with vsync on; ideas?
15:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> linux or windows?
15:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> vulkan?
15:17 <+bridge> <timakro> linux vulkan
15:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> wayland?
15:17 <+bridge> <timakro> x, nvidia
15:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> odd xd
15:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> what does gfx_asyncrender_old say
15:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it should be 1
15:17 <+bridge> <timakro> i got a hunch wayland will fix it
15:18 <+bridge> <timakro> it is 1
15:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I also spell it, but some people say sequel ^^
15:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> gfx_render_thread_count
15:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh is this new
15:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it says 3 for me
15:18 <+bridge> <timakro> for me too
15:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks are u alive? any idea
15:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @timakro do u use a compositor
15:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> does it have like some vsync setting
15:19 <+bridge> <timakro> i don't know i just use gnome
15:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> >  What fixed for me any type of VSync issues in Gnome shell was this extension:
15:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > 
15:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1873/disable-unredirect-fullscreen-windows/

15:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > https://github.com/kazysmaster/gnome-shell-extension-disable-unredirect
15:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > 
15:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > The description may be misleading, but since installing it I no longer experience Vsync issues in Firefox and during gaming. Try it, maybe it will help you. It is easy to disable it so I do not think it will cause issues for you.
15:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> from reddit
15:19 <+bridge> <learath2> It'll do the same thing, with potentially more overhead since it's even less specific
15:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> wayland may fix it too
15:20 <+bridge> <timakro> also with vsync off my gpu fans make audible noise
15:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u can limit fps in ddnet
15:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i limit to 1000
15:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> there is a limit for cpu and gpu

15:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> new ssh vulnerability!
15:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> published today
15:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > A signal handler race condition within the OpenSSH server could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. Various versions of OpenSSH going back years are affected on Linux.
15:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > 
15:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> >     OpenSSH versions earlier than 4.4p1 are vulnerable to this signal handler race condition unless they are patched for CVE-2006-5051 and CVE-2008-4109.
15:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > 
15:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> >     Versions from 4.4p1 up to, but not including, 8.5p1 are not vulnerable due to a transformative patch for CVE-2006-5051, which made a previously unsafe function secure.
15:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > 
15:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> >     The vulnerability resurfaces in versions from 8.5p1 up to, but not including, 9.8p1 due to the accidental removal of a critical component in a function.
15:22 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: thanks that you reported an issue as well, that helped not forgetting it
15:23 <+bridge> <timakro> i think i just turn vsync off and set fps limit to 900 and tearing will be so small that it's not visible
15:24 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess the proper solution would be to inspect the executables to see what dlls they rely on. mind creating an issue?
15:25 <+bridge> <learath2> As soon as I find the bar in this airport
15:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe 0? because the first `a` is of type `bool`, but the assignment returns `()`, so the second `a` is of type `()`
15:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh its rewind time
15:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this seems more of an issue with our ping calculation and less of an issue of needing to inform all game servers of our player's IP address. we shouldn't save ping values that are just spikes
15:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: cool! where do I find it?
15:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, you posted it a few lines later
15:36 <+bridge> <archimede67> @learath2 where is the discord forum at? :kek:
15:37 <+bridge> <learath2> When I get back. I had to travel
15:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 can u get some reimburstment for delays cuz meteorology?
15:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> on flights
15:39 <+bridge> <learath2> Not for meteorology. If it wouldn't have been safe to operate the flight they won't compensate you beyond a replacement flight
15:40 <+bridge> <learath2> If they make scheduling mistakes, they will
15:42 <+bridge> <archimede67> Ow okay
16:15 <+bridge> <zhn> isn it fat af?
16:15 <+bridge> <zhn> isnt*
16:16 <+bridge> <zhn> also how does it solve problem of erasing the type
16:16 <+bridge> <learath2> It is because it has to assume the worst. And the stl kind does not have a move constructor iirc, so it's double bad
16:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it should go to gym
16:17 <+bridge> <zhn> its kinda funny that std::function can be casted to function pointer if held without any context
16:17 <+bridge> <zhn> but can't just become function itself
16:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it can know the type of puserdata if we use a enum and a tag right?
16:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this reminds me of rust enum_dispatch
16:18 <+bridge> <meloƞ> oh lord
16:18 <+bridge> <zhn> why should it know the type xd
16:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why not
16:18 <+bridge> <zhn> also why not use IGameServer
16:22 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> oh, coool!
16:23 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> soon ill be able to link real C functions and use them in my lang 😏
16:23 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> but only simple types xd
16:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nicee
16:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @milkeeycat does ur lang compile to asm directly without llvm?
16:24 <+bridge> <milkeeycat> it generates nasm
16:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i can also call C methods in edlang :owo:
16:24 <+bridge> <zhn> i just dp use c
16:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh
16:25 <+bridge> <zhn> i just do use c
16:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why not generate assembly?
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> pub fn main() -> i64 {
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     let a: i64 = 0;

16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     let b: &mut i64 = &mut a;

16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> }
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its edlang not rust :justatest:
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```rust
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> pub fn main() -> i64 {
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     let mut a: i64 = 0;
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     let b: &mut i64 = &mut a;
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     *b = 2;
16:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki>

17:01 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> oh wow all my msgs to timakro lost
17:01 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> i am spamming this channel since 15 hours
17:02 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @timakro: it has this projectile hitting bug since 13 years? xd
17:02 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Then you can just edit the code to remove projectiles hitting right?
17:02 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> or do you want to avoid compiling such a old source and work only with the binary?
17:02 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> reminds me of some story where microsoft lost some source code and binary patched some bug in one of their products or something like that xd
17:03 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @solayer: everything is possible some things are more work than others. Why should your client do? I built a py lib covering most of the 0.6 and 0.7 protocol parsing but its not a full client yet
17:03 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @timakro:  builds fine on my machine :D woah is that battle fly? i thought it was fastcap
17:03 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Ayo any chance someone wants to proof read my snapshot delta documentation and check for correctness and possible improvements? @patiga  the random issue owner bot has assigned you to this task :p
17:03 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/snap_items.html#snapshot_deltas
17:06 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @timakro: yea having git lens which shows the commit date really made me wanna open an issue on ddnet finally fixing variables.h xd
17:08 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> @0xdeen: woah i did not expect you to get interested in 128. That would be so cool! What happend to the collison O(O^N\*420) problems? ddos attack surface? potato vps? I mean F-DDrace is running smooth since years but not sure if it proofs that it will be flawless for ddnet.
17:09 <+ChillerDragon> ping

17:13 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> ok somehow my js irc client became read only xd
17:14 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> ill be a lurker from now on then
17:37 <+bridge> <solayer> chillerdragon: athanks
17:44 <+ChillerDragon> @solayer what should your client do? are you still planning to do it?
18:11 <+bridge> <patiga> ChillerDragon:
18:11 <+bridge> <patiga> > Those three values are packed integers so their size might be 1 to 4 bytes.
18:11 <+bridge> <patiga> packed ints can be up to 5 bytes long (not '1 to 4')
18:11 <+bridge> <patiga> all values in the snap delta are packed integers, so the sentence is a bit misleading
18:11 <+bridge> <patiga> 
18:11 <+bridge> <patiga> maybe write that you are talking about the network connection. in demos, the deltas apply differently and the keyframes have a differently encoded snapshot
18:11 <+bridge> <patiga> explicitly say that `size` is the amount of i32/ints
18:11 <+bridge> <patiga> maybe point out that type_id, id id thrown together in the deleted items, but separate integers in the item diffs
18:12 <+bridge> <patiga> you could create a visual overview over the entire snap delta, like you did for the single snap item
18:12 <+bridge> <patiga> some of those might be nits, please take them as suggestions :)
18:20 <+bridge> <patiga> if you want, you could try to reorder the paragraphs:
18:20 <+bridge> <patiga> First put into context what a delta/snapshot is, when the server sends it (end of paragraph 'All snapshot items are deltas')
18:20 <+bridge> <patiga> Then describe the layout of the full delta (start of ('All snapshot items are deltas, 'Snapshot data format')
18:20 <+bridge> <patiga> Then go over to the snapshot items
18:20 <+bridge> <patiga> 
18:20 <+bridge> <patiga> (though that might be a bit too much change, I think its also good rn)
18:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> nice! my touch screen will work with ddnet? ^^ (also @_noby)
18:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> could probably be fixed by @learath2, I think he proxies the webhook from github
18:34 <+bridge> <learath2> I filter some. I'll have to take a look at why it happens
18:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: yes! tests are cool, and designing a nice test system is hard. e.g. I don't know how to test UI applications. but it'd be really nice if the ddnet client was also properly tested (e.g. firefox definitely has UI tests)
18:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> egyt: is Hz different in different languages?
18:47 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> OMGGGGG things get real
18:47 <+bridge> <zhn> why it's so huge :justatest:
18:47 <+bridge> <zhn> there more 07 stuff than everything else
18:50 <+bridge> <jxsl13> translation os phonetically possible, as some languages like russian don't have the Latin H. but usually with such unit's it's international.
18:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure what it would improve to put the gameservers into containers… they're already a single executable. probably mostly makes debugging more difficult
18:50 <+bridge> <jxsl13> is
18:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> linux repositories contain fully open-source binaries of ddnet
18:51 <+bridge> <zhn> Hz in russian is Гц
18:51 <+bridge> <zhn> cuz Герц
18:52 <+bridge> <learath2> Would make our deployment simpler and more reproducible
18:52 <+bridge> <jxsl13> H translates to G
18:52 <+bridge> <jxsl13> cuz no H
18:52 <+bridge> <zhn> it should have been be Херц but idk it just got more popular ig
18:52 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmmm. shouldn't it try to install from source then?
18:53 <+bridge> <jxsl13> Hamburger classic Gamburger
18:53 <+bridge> <learath2> Why not Х do you happen to know?
18:53 <+bridge> <zhn> xd
18:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I use zfs everywhere. works quite nicely. sometimes I can't upgrade the kernel to the latest version
18:53 <+bridge> <zhn> different pronouncation did the thing
18:53 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm now running btrfs, so far so good
18:54 <+bridge> <jxsl13> X is more of a Ch
18:54 <+bridge> <zhn> nop
18:54 <+bridge> <jxsl13> or a spanish J of Juan
18:54 <+bridge> <learath2> Ch sounds way off
18:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> timing mostly, I believe
18:55 <+bridge> <jxsl13> the german Ch, not the english Ch.
18:55 <+bridge> <zhn> wait is Hertz = Görtz
18:55 <+bridge> <robyt3> It's like the "ch" in "Loch" or German "Bach" yeah
18:55 <+bridge> <jxsl13> Charakter f.e.
18:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: aged like milk :p
18:56 <+bridge> <zhn> what's correct way to pronounce Heinrich?
18:56 <+bridge> <jxsl13> Hi
18:56 <+bridge> <jxsl13> Hi-n
18:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that sounds like a weird thing… probably every language has zealots. C and C++ definitely do
18:57 <+bridge> <zhn> Heinrich = Генрих
18:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> `%s/foo/bar/c`. the `c` makes it selective
18:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what's `caw`? I know `ci"` which deletes everything in double quotes
18:58 <+bridge> <robyt3> Assuming SDL touch input works for your platform, I didn't have any luck with Windows
18:59 <+bridge> <jxsl13> гаынрищ
18:59 <+bridge> <zhn> what
18:59 <+bridge> <zhn> hi-n-risch
18:59 <+bridge> <jxsl13> yes
18:59 <+bridge> <learath2> a is a"round"
18:59 <+bridge> <jxsl13> mor or less
18:59 <+bridge> <learath2> So it also gets the quotes
19:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> juan!!
19:00 <+bridge> <learath2> I still believe the х is much closer to h than g. G is not even a fricative anymore
19:00 <+bridge> <learath2> Sounds absurd
19:00 <+bridge> <zhn> its easier to pronounce g than h as first consonant
19:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> X in catalan sounds like sh
19:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think
19:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Xavi
19:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh its more like ch
19:01 <+bridge> <egyt> Good thing we don't have "x" in Esperanto
19:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well depends on the position
19:01 <+bridge> <jxsl13> the english ch
19:01 <+bridge> <jxsl13> ?
19:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> baixa vs Xavi
19:01 <+bridge> <zhn> xd
19:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Xavi is said like cha·vee
19:02 <+bridge> <jxsl13> k
19:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and baixa
19:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is like  bye-sha
19:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it will
19:02 <+bridge> <learath2> Baixa feels more chinese than catalan 😄
19:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lol no
19:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> baixa aquí
19:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what are you doing? sounds interesting ^^
19:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its like saying come here
19:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> baixa aqui
19:04 <+bridge> <learath2> I just noticed my french is godawful now. It was never great but now I sound wrong too 😄
19:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> libffi didnt work cuz i dont know how tou emulate the i128 bit type with 16 byte align
19:04 <+bridge> <learath2> I need to refrench
19:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> do u know spanish?
19:04 <+bridge> <learath2> Can't you specify an alignment for a specific struct?
19:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i always find funny spanish is among the top spoken languages
19:04 <+bridge> <learath2> I know no spanish at all
19:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> key. will be hard otherwise
19:05 <+bridge> <learath2> Vamos
19:05 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> a la playa

19:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> despacito
19:06 <+bridge> <learath2> The spanish kinda conquered the world, killed the natives, planted their own people there and left
19:06 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/5fae8676a091ea3237f53d6c6fbcbbaa57453344
19:06 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I don't verify the packet currently
19:06 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but it cant break anything, it's just a hash being sent
19:06 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> haha
19:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its said the spanish once had enough territory that the sun was always up
19:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or maybe i made that up
19:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 lot of south americans joke about spain needing to return the stolen gold xd
19:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but they dont know most south americans are immigrants from europe
19:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> like argentinians, most have italian parents or grandpas
19:08 <+bridge> <learath2> No you did not. It was used to refer to the spanish then the british empires at their times
19:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> what do u think about this invention
19:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257382431019765781/51hWU14BiNL._AC_SL1468_.jpg?ex=66843424&is=6682e2a4&hm=8e9a1a741fdc5fad63d6c06ddd276c2b6beec6018aeefa58b27a9f3e6f5eae48&
19:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> modern fan but no noise? xd
19:09 <+bridge> <learath2> It's 😎
19:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i want to buy one
19:09 <+bridge> <learath2> Depending on price I might consider it
19:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> found this fro 280€
19:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> they a bit expensive
19:09 <+bridge> <learath2> No way on earth am I paying 280 for a fan
19:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: yea. I (accidentally) took a break from ddnet, but it was good, I think. I'll review this PR if I happen to go through PRs again
19:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it also filters
19:10 <+bridge> <learath2> It better
19:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> anyway the key point is its way more silent
19:10 <+bridge> <learath2> If it also cleans, I might consider it
19:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this one is rowenta
19:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but the expensive one is from Dyson
19:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 wanna see the funniest shit
19:11 <+bridge> <jxsl13> get the 800€ dyson one
19:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this is a dyson invention

19:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> imagine going out with this
19:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its a air filter
19:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cyberpunk vibes
19:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://edgl.dev/blog/rust-fn-size-trick/ cool blog post. could you maybe link the last example to github?
19:12 <+bridge> <learath2> I am so enjoying my new laptop. 16 cores and 64g of ram is so cool

19:12 <+bridge> <jxsl13> gotta kneel before this godly creature.
19:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it'll do the same thing, but we could use closures and get type safety
19:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nice
19:14 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it was hard to pay the servers, I donated because I wanted ddnet rus to stay up (like all other servers, too)
19:14 <+bridge> <learath2> Oh also, neverssl.com is quite useful if you ever find yourself struggling to connect to a hotspot outside
19:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257383995801604158/image.png?ex=66843599&is=6682e419&hm=0689dd51eac588a06b373a646b2a037db9532a71a1827c8d1bb61a4935bfdf00&
19:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my post got some traction kek
19:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it happens because github is broken. I also get the email twice
19:15 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah, well my stateless filter can't handle that
19:16 <+bridge> <learath2> Maybe I can add some state in ram
19:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> nah, always h → г in transcription AFAIK
19:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, russian "х" is pronounced more like german "ch" than "h" AFAIK
19:17 <+bridge> <power0412> You are a legend mate
19:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> гаинрих?
19:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> you know russian?
19:18 <+bridge> <jxsl13> sound-wise this is close imo
19:18 <+bridge> <learath2> Dynamic type safety is pretty meh. I don't think this has ever been an issue, it's very common to pass a void* for context and get it back
19:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no need for state. just block the github-merge-queue updates. these are the duplicates
19:20 <+bridge> <learath2> If you have a minute to add my new ssh key I can take a look right now
19:20 <+bridge> <jxsl13> хаынрищ
19:20 <+bridge> <jxsl13> even closer
19:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you pronounce heinrich differently from how I do it ^^ are you german?
19:21 <+bridge> <0xdeen> the initial ping can also be arbitrarily wrong
19:21 <+bridge> <jxsl13> I am German indeed
19:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sure. what SSH key should I give root access to ddnet servers?
19:22 <+bridge> <learath2> I see how that might be sus 😄
19:22 <+bridge> <learath2> https://github.com/learath2.keys the very bottom one
19:22 <+bridge> <0xdeen> I'd be interested in running it the most powerful servers we have
19:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh TIL https://github.com/edg-l.keys
19:23 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> wdym initial ping? currently, the issue is that we use a sample of 1 to set the ping. if the internet has a bad moment at the last ping we tried, then we'll save that. what we could instead do would be use an average and maybe even stop taking that into account after some time
19:24 <+bridge> <0xdeen> The estimation of distance we show when you never connected to a server before
19:26 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah that one can be wrong since the geolocation db isn't perfect
19:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> looks like deen prefers rsa
19:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> heinrich too
19:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I should move to ec keys
19:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> they're much shorter
19:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> robyt uses rsa too
19:26 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
19:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> old defaults, I guess
19:27 <+bridge> <learath2> I guess while you are connected to the server, we can sample the ping every once in a while, and keep a couple dozen samples, discarding outliers at a speed proportional to their distance to the mean or sth
19:27 <+bridge> <0xdeen> More like EC was not available when I set up my keys
19:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/ChillerDragon.keys
19:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> as expected
19:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> chiller dragon uses rsa, and has a fuck ton keys XD
19:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah. I guess we should update the geoip db. we're using a years-old version
19:28 <+bridge> <0xdeen> IPs keep changing owners faster and faster, I think this is impossible to get perfect
19:28 <+bridge> <0xdeen> But we still should, where is it running? 😄
19:28 <+bridge> <zhn> all literature i have met use "Генрих"
19:28 <+bridge> <zhn> pronounces the same way as written
19:28 <+bridge> <learath2> can you also document a way to add overrides? I spotted turkey in USA once but didn't know how to fix
19:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, didn't know its official transcription. but that is not how it's pronounced in german
19:30 <+bridge> <zhn> ye, jxsl posted right pronounciation there somewhere
19:30 <+bridge> <jxsl13> хаынрищ
19:30 <+bridge> <zhn> ye, jxsl posted right pronunciation there somewhere
19:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> there's `/home/httpmaster/locations.csv` which it currently uses. it's a very bad format. I think I should update it to use a better format, then we can also get easier updates
19:31 <+bridge> <jxsl13> coming from north western germany
19:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> my north-west german interpretation most definitely doesn't have a щ at the end. but a х ^^
19:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, nvm. north east
19:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'll code it, I feel like it right now
19:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's rust \o/
19:36 <+bridge> <0xdeen> @.insanity_ Thanks a lot! Since POL is currently not running I used it for the other servers, hope that's fine
19:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @0xdeen Do I need to fix the tests?
19:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Build runs through
19:39 <+bridge> <learath2> Hm, are you sure? I see someone also added a direct discord webhook to the ddnet org, maybe that is causing the doubles?
19:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's what I get in emails, anyway. always "deen closed the issue", then "github-merge-queue closed the issue"
19:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> dunno why this is broken for months
19:41 <+bridge> <.insanity_> ik dw
19:41 <+bridge> <0xdeen> yes, please
19:42 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Can't see why it fails
19:42 <+bridge> <zhn> ig clang tidy
19:42 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah, I see. Pull requests are not going through filter-events. We get those directly, only branch creates and pushes I handled by hand. Idk what the issue was that we fixed with it
19:42 <+bridge> <zhn> also could you change all `ClientID` back to `ClientId`?
19:43 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> there's an attached log with a backtrace
19:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> bruh, this is just for testing purpose
19:43 <+bridge> <0xdeen> @fokkonaut seems pretty clear:
19:43 <+bridge> <0xdeen> ```
19:43 <+bridge> <0xdeen> thread 'main' panicked at src/engine/console.rs:63:1:
19:43 <+bridge> <0xdeen> assertion failed: executed == 67
19:43 <+bridge> <0xdeen> ```
19:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> rust?
19:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> idk
19:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> never used that
19:43 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's like any other language
19:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> where do i find that test?
19:43 <+bridge> <0xdeen> I'll try to fix it
19:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> didnt work with ddnet base in a while
19:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the output contains the line
19:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and the file
19:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm. but it seems to be wrong (the line)
19:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> XD
19:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but I find a 67 in the file
19:45 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Thanks
19:45 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the issue seems to be that `command all` isn't executed 64 times anymore, but 128 times
19:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> so you probably have to add 64 to that number
19:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (btw, you can run the tests locally using `cmake --build build --target run_tests`)
19:46 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ah
19:46 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> no 128 would be correct
19:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> the expected output should change
19:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
19:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's what I mean
19:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> cool, ty, do you know if it works from VS?
19:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> VS code or VS?
19:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i feel like a boomer still using that shit
19:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> VS :(
19:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
19:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> make me move to vs code in the future pls
19:48 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmmm. not sure tbh. is there a `run_tests` target somewhere?
19:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @ryozuki !remindme 100days
19:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> never seen that, but i'll check it out later
19:48 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (generally, I like msvc better than visual studio code)
19:48 <+bridge> <learath2> Hm, it did not happen here, maybe it is fixed? :thonk:
19:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> u mean vs?
19:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
19:49 <+bridge> <jxsl13> vs code is getting worse with every new release
19:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Hmm
19:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I'm pretty unsure about what IDE to main
19:49 <+bridge> <jxsl13> just keep on waiting a little bit longer and you might join the new hyped editor
19:49 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i recommend a good text editor + terminal
19:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not really feasible on windows, I think
19:50 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> u wont believe me, but im using windows terminal (not cmd)
19:50 <+bridge> <meloƞ> sublime text and msys2 are godsent
19:50 <+bridge> <jxsl13> I'm using vs code but the last release introduced quite a few crash bugs that I have at least triggered myself
19:50 <+bridge> <learath2> If it has to be an IDE I keep hearing good things about CLion from people that are not stupid
19:51 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yea that one seems to be good
19:51 <+bridge> <jxsl13> sublime text was great
19:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i use vscode and neovim
19:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no issues
19:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the best IDE is linux
19:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rg, fd, cargo, vim
19:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> vscode has issues with blocking your cargo build IIRC
19:51 <+bridge> <learath2> If you are okay with the terminal being part of your workflow just any text editor with LSP support is great
19:51 <+bridge> <zhn> got caught by clion indexing ddnet codebase for 15 minutes, uninstalled after
19:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> is what I saw from people using vscode
19:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
19:51 <+bridge> <meloƞ> lol
19:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i guess clion doesnt use clangd?
19:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> clangd is p fast
19:51 <+bridge> <meloƞ> it does
19:52 <+bridge> <learath2> Yeah, I just gave up on these kinds of things. I'm very comfortable with my terminal tools and just add stuff to my neovim as I need it
19:52 <+bridge> <zhn> +1
19:52 <+bridge> <zhn> im trying on emacs but emacs is too powerful to be ide
19:52 <+bridge> <jxsl13> alway wanted to try neovim
19:53 <+bridge> <jxsl13> but the pain is not painful enough
19:53 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> man, that convo escalated really quick
19:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/cmake-project-missing-option-to-run-custom-targets/442367
19:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> can you check whether there's a "target view" in solution explorer?
19:54 <+bridge> <zhn> it died as fast as it escalated
19:54 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xD
19:54 <+bridge> <meloƞ> in here?

19:54 <+bridge> <learath2> If you are not already kinda comfy in vim, I really wouldn't suggest it. It's like a guaranteed loss in productivity for the first month or so where you'll fumble around with motions
19:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Can't seem to find it
19:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes. run the `run_tests` or `run_rust_tests`
19:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @blaiszephyr teach @fokkonaut how you found it
19:55 <+bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
19:55 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> :D
19:56 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @0xdeen Will you host it on GER10?
19:56 <+bridge> <jxsl13> I do my occasional server hopping and fixing our monitoring stuff using vim on some aix server in the worst case. But not using it for productive development of stuff. just editing some config files or perl scripts
19:56 <+bridge> <learath2> If the double github pull request notification happens again, ping me and I'll filter it. I think it was fixed on the github side though
19:56 <+bridge> <meloƞ> @fokkonaut

19:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> fixed on the github side? I doubt it. this issue has happened to my email ever since we started using the github merge queue
19:57 <+bridge> <meloƞ> what VS version is that
19:57 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> 2019
19:57 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> :kek:
19:57 <+bridge> <meloƞ> im using 2022
19:57 <+bridge> <meloƞ> ._.
19:57 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I just recently updated it from a more older 2019 version
19:57 <+bridge> <meloƞ> :pepe_holy:

19:58 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> One day I decided to stop updating it, cuz every update broke more features and removed stuff
19:58 <+bridge> <meloƞ> but it should still show up in there as `CMake-Zielansicht`
19:58 <+bridge> <meloƞ> click on that and it should open up all targets
19:58 <+bridge> <0xdeen> I wanted to try UKR first, then RUS, then GER etc
19:58 <+bridge> <learath2> I love how this modern web application is so shit that even it's link contraction doesn't work properly
19:58 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Alright
19:58 <+bridge> <meloƞ> doubleclick on that and it should open up all targets
19:58 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Mainly so more people go to UKR server 😄
19:58 <+bridge> <meloƞ> doubleclick on that and it should open up all targets for your Project
19:58 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> :D
20:00 <+bridge> <meloƞ> fokko its about the 128 player support right?
20:00 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yea
20:00 <+bridge> <meloƞ> lemme run tests for ya - before you loose your sanity
20:00 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> deen fixed it
20:00 <+bridge> <meloƞ> god damn it, i wanted to be useful
20:00 <+bridge> <meloƞ> :feelsbadman:
20:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> np, u can port my mod to ddnet base
20:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> 10€
20:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> offer of ur life
20:01 <+bridge> <meloƞ> 20€ and 2 worn pieces of  lacoste socks
20:01 <+bridge> <meloƞ> not whole socks, just pieces
20:01 <+bridge> <0xdeen> I'll provide another fix
20:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i only have puma socks, i think
20:01 <+bridge> <meloƞ> same - the 20pair packs are insane
20:02 <+bridge> <meloƞ> 8€ or smth
20:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xD
20:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> right
20:02 <+bridge> <learath2> oh that's why your tests are failing, you are supposed to be wearing programming socks
20:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> You have this enum:
20:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkPresentModeKHR.html
20:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If one of the enum types doesnt work that is a driver thing.
20:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Vsync is VK\_PRESENT\_MODE\_FIFO\_KHR, ddnet tries that.
20:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Nothing i can do xd
20:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Also summer holidays for me, so I am more alive than ever 😏
20:02 <+bridge> <meloƞ> jupsti is alive!
20:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> reminds me of my co-worker, he has a cup which says "I drink and I know things" :D
20:03 <+bridge> <meloƞ> summer holiday already? mine starts on 29th july >:(
20:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> afk

20:04 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I dont :(
20:04 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I want a teeworlds cup with all y'all tees

20:05 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i live on mars
20:05 <+bridge> <meloƞ> ok i tell elon to send one with next shuttle
20:05 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> lmao
20:05 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it wont survive the thrust tho
20:05 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> too fragile
20:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We still talked in-game yesterday, you can't miss me already xddd
20:06 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> afk

20:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> please edit the spaces out
20:10 <+bridge> <meloƞ> `spaces` ? - i can make a super small video showcasing that stuff if that's what you mean :D
20:25 <+bridge> <egyt> Emacs ftw
20:25 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @0xdeen can you also start a susterism server or back in time 3 whatever
20:25 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Would be nice to see Insane + Novice
20:26 <+bridge> <0xdeen> There seem to be some serious problems still, uninitialized memory, larger allocations for db inserts etc
20:26 <+bridge> <0xdeen> It'd be sad for Insane people to lose their runs because of crashes etc
20:26 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> true that, maybe Brutal? Stronghold or smth
20:26 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> thats not too hard/long
20:27 <+bridge> <meloƞ> simple down 3 sounds like a fun way to enjoy 128 people
20:27 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Ye
20:27 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> lets go haha, people know its Beta
20:27 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> hoepfully
20:27 <+bridge> <meloƞ> its not really deadly, and i can imagine it'll be really fun
20:28 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea
20:29 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Done
20:29 <+bridge> <meloƞ> nice!
20:30 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> `2024-07-01 20:29:59 I chat:  : (invalid): Do you know someone who uses a bot? Please report them to the moderators.`
20:30 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> lmao
20:30 <+bridge> <0xdeen> 12% CPU usage of one core with 70 players, so far so good 😉
20:30 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Yeah, we have to fix that too @fokkonaut
20:30 <+bridge> <learath2> Hehe, completely forgot about that
20:30 <+bridge> <egyt> glhf!
20:31 <+bridge> <0xdeen> I'll go afk for a while, taking bets on whether the server will crash 😄
20:31 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> tees sometimes weirdly flash and appear as weapons but other than that it seems to run really smoothly
20:31 <+bridge> <meloƞ> im not able to shoot/hammer :D help!
20:31 <+bridge> <:v> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257403210239442954/image.png?ex=6684477e&is=6682f5fe&hm=19840ede0c7e7899ddbbf97a40466386472085546b958c2bcc6d3e73bbcb10ba&
20:31 <+bridge> <meloƞ> 20€ dono to a server of your choice if it crashes
20:31 <+bridge> <:v> is that normal ?
20:31 <+bridge> <learath2> I'll put 5$ on it'll crash
20:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> :)
20:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> thats ddnet code
20:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ah
20:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> well
20:32 <+bridge> <meloƞ> :P
20:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> XD
20:34 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @0xdeen I say it won't crash
20:34 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but idk ddnet's code nowadays enough in order to tell haha
20:35 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> But I can see some tees flying around here and there
20:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> never seen that on my srv even with 128
20:36 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> ye its really weird
20:36 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> compared to your server
20:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Hm, I wonder why. Code is more or less same
20:36 <+bridge> <meloƞ> fokko is your source even based off of latest ddnet?
20:36 <+bridge> <robyt3> I see hammer and gun entities flying around instead of tees sometimes :monkaS:
20:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> just little differences i think
20:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> no, 0.7 vanilla
20:37 <+bridge> <meloƞ> :kek:
20:37 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i see
20:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> thats supposed to happen when the idmap is full, so if there is a tee missing in the map that can happen
20:37 <+bridge> <learath2> I'm unsure whether we want to allow these servers to make ranks 😄
20:37 <+bridge> <learath2> There might be some exotic bugs there
20:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> probably not
20:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @0xdeen Can you set sv_mapupdaterate 15?
20:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it's on 5 in ddnet i think, and my server uses 15
20:38 <+bridge> <meloƞ> i can see some maps where over 70 tee's are enough to skip insane amounts :D
20:38 <+bridge> <0xdeen> @fokkonaut Why do tees closeby to me stay weapons?
20:38 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> @fokkonaut this shouldnt really happen with such a low number of tees next to you no?
20:38 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257405026586857563/screenshot_2024-07-01_20-37-55.png?ex=6684492f&is=6682f7af&hm=023208bbc409af641f9c98b2396480305a6ee0ff19a83bce0d51a9031678bcc7&
20:38 <+bridge> <x_lovelyy> hi
20:38 <+bridge> <0xdeen> sure
20:38 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> It's possible that there's a bug, try moving your cursor away, and resume
20:38 <+bridge> <x_lovelyy> How can I become an admin?
20:39 <+bridge> <x_lovelyy> deen
20:39 <+bridge> <:v> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/1257403210428321832 same for me
20:39 <+bridge> <learath2> Straight to admin dam
20:39 <+bridge> <x_lovelyy> no moderator
20:39 <+bridge> <x_lovelyy> or tester
20:39 <+bridge> <:v> he trys to speedrun ddnet staff
20:39 <+bridge> <0xdeen> done
20:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> thanks, definitely less jumpy
20:40 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Try the 80 player server, they always stay
20:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i am on ukr
20:40 <+bridge> <meloƞ> this is fun - LGTM - !
20:40 <+bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257405535536283840/2024-07-01_18-34-35-00.04.51.434-00.04.57.827.mp4?ex=668449a9&is=6682f829&hm=8e4dc5b7c223d199b877d96c4d21c7bc2e37644557438dc0c134d9e53928fdea&
20:40 <+bridge> <learath2> You should ask in #questions next time, but anyway, you need to make an application when we open applications again. Which should be soon
20:41 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Yea, there's a bug that can happen, didn't know it happens so frequently. Definitely happens less when tees are more spread apart
20:41 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> looks so funny XD
20:41 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257405788734095370/screenshot_2024-07-01_20-41-34.png?ex=668449e5&is=6682f865&hm=bbdcf6554bf944dfc48db00f157dc364ef0925b92c09f79ff04848aecc06a29f&
20:41 <+bridge> <meloƞ> jupsti isnt here is he? he had that on his impl aswell and got a fix for that iirc
20:41 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> seeing those walking hammers and guns trying to beat a map
20:42 <+bridge> <learath2> I think you mentioned that you don't keep track of distance
20:42 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Exactly
20:43 <+bridge> <meloƞ> it just skips rendering completly, also hook's are rendered as lasers? XD
20:43 <+bridge> <learath2> When do you decide to stop snapping characters? When the snapshot is full?
20:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yup
20:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> serverside
20:43 <+bridge> <syrinok> Is it expected that IDs for moderating are wrong
20:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> No, usually only when a new player crosses your networkjclipped viewdistance, he will get added and replaces a tee that is not in your distance
20:44 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> i seriously thought if you server was running this so well then it will go way easier on ddnet lol
20:44 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> yes
20:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> so when people are too tight in one spot (according to zoom distance "close"), then that can happen
20:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> zooming in can fix all issues too, i think
20:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> tzooming and  a little and moving cursor away
20:44 <+bridge> <meloƞ> yeah this is a thing on bw aswell, you cant trust the "show clientID" indicator in scoreboard
20:45 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I made a command which makes it possible to "trust" the id
20:45 <+bridge> <0xdeen> Implement 128 players client-side instead, all this playermapping is way too messy
20:45 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but since i could only moderate 64 tees then, i reverted it and just use status "name"
20:45 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> status fok
20:45 <+bridge> <learath2> and what is the max amount of players you render?
20:45 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ofc 64, rest is gun+laser
20:45 <+bridge> <meloƞ> can the client even render more than 64?
20:46 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> no
20:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, if you change it
20:46 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> not without a change
20:46 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
20:46 <+bridge> <learath2> This might not be possible without extensive changes. We might be at the edge of the snaps size anyway
20:46 <+bridge> <meloƞ> yeah i mean obviously :D
20:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess we should collect statistics on that ^^
20:46 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I can report no issues on my server, using thousands of objects for plots, free drawing areas, etc
20:46 <+bridge> <learath2> I don't think we have anything already set up to split snaps up either
20:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Dropped weapons, dropped guns. You just have to see which things you snap first
20:47 <+bridge> <meloƞ> poke chiller - he loves to play around with that
20:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> so the rest can get filled up
20:47 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> and ddnet is not close to reaching the limit
20:47 <+bridge> <learath2> but character objects are large, if there is a way to force the server to snap a very different character quickly, and we don't gracefully break up snaps you could dos the server with a couple tees
20:47 <+bridge> <meloƞ> deen status on the server load atm? we peak at 83/127 atm
20:48 <+bridge> <meloƞ> deen status on the server load atm? we peak at 83/127
20:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Oh, true I forgot. I was only sending half the clients (64)
20:48 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> mhh
20:48 <+bridge> <0xdeen> 15% of one CPU core, totally fine
20:48 <+bridge> <meloƞ> 90 now - damn
20:48 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> @fokkonaut what about those skin updates?
20:48 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> that were stressing the server a lot
20:49 <+bridge> <learath2> idk, it might be fine, but we definitely need to run the numbers, if 128 full characters don't fit, I think someone should introduce a snap splitting mechanism or enlarge snaps somehow
20:49 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> with rainbow and stuff
20:49 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> sad, nobody joining simpel down
20:49 <+bridge> <robyt3> 128 player scoreboard would also "work" without scrolling (imagine twice as many players in this screenshot) :justatest:
20:49 <+bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257407844454760458/screenshot_2024-07-01_20-49-00.png?ex=66844bcf&is=6682fa4f&hm=224af3c892f1a06104530c07e534409aeffdb5d10551acab43142fbb74f0c066&

20:50 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
20:50 <+bridge> <learath2> :PepeCross:
20:51 <+bridge> <robyt3> Also ignore the bundle of stuck debug dummies :kek:
20:51 <+bridge> <meloƞ> reminds me of jupsti's screenshot
20:55 <+bridge> <meloƞ> im literally having the time of my life with this - can we keep it?
20:55 <+bridge> <meloƞ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257409297743085600/asdasdasdasdasdasdasd.mp4?ex=66844d2a&is=6682fbaa&hm=7f311fff031a168a65f3842fafcd8e8e3daf6b12b84714fc0f9de567dbe43e55&
20:57 <+bridge> <learath2> a hammer moving around on it's own using lasers as a hook is trippy
21:01 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> oh nice
21:01 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> some people started joining impel down
21:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> need more
21:02 <+bridge> <soulyvevo> im running 4 tees on impel and multeasy
21:05 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @0xdeen cant identify the bug rn why it's not exactly like on my srv, but ye, we need client impl anyways

21:12 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @0xdeen i pushed a fix
21:13 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> that's what happens when u introduce new variables and rename things to fit the other source base better
21:13 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
21:15 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 could you update the servers with the new commit?
21:15 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'll leave that to @0xdeen
21:15 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> shit
21:15 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> hes afk
21:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'll look at it
21:16 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Thanks!
21:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can DM me details why this is urgent
21:16 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (if it is)
21:16 <+bridge> <meloƞ> its a oneliner
21:16 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> cuz it solves uninitialized garbage memory
21:16 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> lmao
21:20 <+bridge> <0xdeen> building
21:20 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> nice!
21:20 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> phew
21:20 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> should definitely be better now after that
21:21 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> now you can probably leave the mapupdaterate at 5, but would be cool at 15 again so i can compare it better
21:26 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> will you restart the servers?
21:29 <+bridge> <zhn> wait will fokko's pr be staying there until full 64 -> 128 codebase migration (client support, 128 teams instead of 64 and so on)
21:30 <+bridge> <learath2> It's mostly an experiment. It can stick around for a bit to evaluate what would need to be done to have full proper 128 player support
21:30 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> any issues?
21:31 <+bridge> <totar> Single tick reload grenade weapon tune can cause much bigger snapshots than 128 players afaik
21:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> It's required to be restarted quickly, as this uninitialized memory makes players jump/appear in wrong positions
21:33 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it's like the core breaking point :D
21:33 <+bridge> <learath2> We just need to know what happens when we go over max snap size and if the client recovers gracefully
21:34 <+bridge> <totar> good point
21:34 <+bridge> <learath2> Also look into if we can just split the snap so there is no recovery needed 😄
21:34 <+bridge> <learath2> I think not though. We can't just wait for the more packet
21:35 <+bridge> <learath2> Perhaps a way to ensure the things that didn't make it into the last snap get snapped fully the next
21:35 <+bridge> <totar> Is a single snap meant to fit into a single network packet? Where does the size limit come from
21:36 <+bridge> <learath2> Don't have the code in front of me. I only know there is a limit
21:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you could increase the limit theoretically
21:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> there's already splitting of snaps into multiple network messages
21:37 <+bridge> <learath2> Ah nice
21:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yea, it's just a size change in the client
21:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but someone should run a calculation first
21:37 <+bridge> <totar> What's the concern for making the limit really big? DoS?
21:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i checked it out in the server, you can increase the size easily, but the client has to have the same change.
21:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess self-DoS of the server
21:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> when it spawns so many entities that it self-DoSes because it sends too many things
21:38 <+bridge> <zhn> so mapping will be required to support old clients?
21:38 <+bridge> <zhn> or ddnet will drop old ones :poggers:
21:38 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> cant support old clients
21:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at those font sizes you can also use a third column instead
21:38 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes, mapping would be required for old clients
21:38 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> no
21:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> have u seen my 1000 player scoreboard?
21:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> thats not possible @heinrich5991
21:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i could still read it on my screen
21:39 <+bridge> <zhn> wdym
21:39 <+bridge> <totar> What's not possible
21:39 <+bridge> <zhn> this pr actually adds 128 support for old clients
21:39 <+bridge> <zhn> because theyre 64p clients
21:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> mapping of player IDs is necessary for 64 players. the snapshot size cannot be increased for old clients
21:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> the snapshot is applied though.
21:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> mapping of player IDs is necessary for 64 players on old clients. the snapshot size cannot be increased for old clients
21:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yes, thats what i am saying
21:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> its not possible to increase it for old clients, like in mapping it somehow
21:40 <+bridge> <zhn> hey jopsti
21:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> me too. but it seemed like you thought we were disagreeing. thus I said the same thing, but more verbose
21:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yea, it looked liked it, because zhn seemed to be supporting you
21:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hey gerdoe, since when did u rename back
21:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> since u said this
21:40 <+bridge> <zhn> matrix thingie im still zhn
21:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> oh k
21:41 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> heino u understand ? xd
21:43 <+bridge> <zhn> i was talking about this though
21:43 <+bridge> <zhn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257421277942251614/image.png?ex=66845852&is=668306d2&hm=0396177651086a7a7c51061dab93438bdddb4ae77a743aa7469c298eb33043e3&
21:43 <+bridge> <zhn> like we all three said same thing idk
21:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> thats only the case if would support old clients
21:44 <+bridge> <zhn> i said literally what you said xd
21:44 <+bridge> <zhn> i said literally the same thing you said xd
21:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> thought ur talking about the snaps
21:44 <+bridge> <zhn> nah :D
21:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> where is deen tho
21:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> :(
21:55 <+bridge> <.insanity_> i didnt even see you there
21:55 <+bridge> <meloƞ> rude :(
21:56 <+bridge> <.insanity_> :feelsbadman:
22:16 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @learath2 @heinrich5991 could someone of you update the beta servers....
22:16 <+bridge> <meloƞ> Poor foko
22:20 <+bridge> <jxsl13> Elongatees :'/
22:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> given that currently 75 players play on it, I'd prefer not to…
22:21 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ITS BROKEN AF
22:21 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> tf
22:21 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> the uninitialized memory does garbage
22:22 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> its the core of everything which is uninitialized here xd
22:22 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> they'll understand
22:22 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> and be happy after it
22:24 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> announce it with a broadcast
22:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I locked the servers, they'll restart once they empty out
22:30 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> hah
22:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i mean it says beta so they were warned xd
22:30 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> cool, simpel down is restarted i believe
22:31 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> exactly
22:31 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> and on multeasy its the best to test rn
22:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im just curious if any exploit comes out of this
22:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> does it run on the official database?
22:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i should get ready to hack
22:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hackerman
22:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 does it run the new commit ?
22:32 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> check /info
22:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> am about to
22:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> cool
22:33 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> restart the russian multeasy already :D it has 4 players
22:34 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257434238995791944/image.png?ex=66846464&is=668312e4&hm=4ba212528014171a52f9dd5bd6153d0124129a9bd324671f317a33a0a0336dd3&
22:34 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> stalker
22:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> seems like 128p servers are famous, i should run 512p server
22:35 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it's mostly the map ^^
22:35 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> this could also easily be exceeded to 256
22:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> the server run at 12-15% with 90p
22:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> change 5 vars, done
22:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> depends if the network code scales
22:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if all players are active
22:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yea, true
22:36 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> heinrich, can you check the mapupdaterate and what it's set to currently?
22:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> meh. I don't actually want to live-support this experiment…
22:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> k
22:37 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> its either 5 or 15
22:38 <+bridge> <egyt> Some math tells me that we will be barely able to do 512p, let alone FullHD
22:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> FullHD server omg, that is a good name
22:39 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> will be famous af
22:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> u can make a frame
22:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> with tees
22:39 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> that would be cool
22:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> Beta UKR players dropping under 30almost
22:40 <+bridge> <egyt> Well, we don't have 2073600 players, so no FuldHD
22:40 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> haha true
22:40 <+bridge> <egyt> Well, we don't have 2073600 players, so no FullHD, unfortunately
22:40 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 1080p is fullhd
22:42 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> 25p left
22:42 <+bridge> <egyt> "Bad Apple!!" in DDNet? Sounds crazy
22:43 <+bridge> <zhn> isnt it real to make already
22:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but 1000 lines patch for 128p support, uff
22:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
22:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if ddnet code wouldnt suck it would be exactly changing one config variable instead xd
22:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ye
22:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> but this is only for supporting old client
22:43 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> thats why its so much
22:43 <+bridge> <zhn> never knew that it was client issue
22:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everything uses MAX\_CLIENTS
22:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everything are hardcoded arrays in ddnet
22:44 <+bridge> <zhn> is MAX_PLAYERS defined xd
22:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it scales in almost no aspect
22:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> also, collision code is quadratic
22:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
22:44 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> u can use distance squared
22:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> dd-pg ftw
22:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wont help
22:45 <+bridge> <zhn> it introduces physics change, no?
22:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i send what helps, and i am sure it can be applied to ddnet if carefully done
22:45 <+bridge> <learath2> Distance squared isn't going to fix the quadratic part
22:45 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> true
22:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nope
22:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well not what makes collision code non-n²
22:45 <+bridge> <learath2> Quadratic part is that every tee has to test if it collides with any other tee 😄
22:46 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> ye
22:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the only edge case is if tees stack
22:46 <+bridge> <learath2> N tees doing n checks. N^2 :Celebrate:
22:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but that is an edge case with basically every structure
22:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> worst case\*
22:46 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 can u see if the ukr server is restartable ? its 18 left on lock
22:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not yet
22:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not yet ready to restart
22:53 <+bridge> <jxsl13> ddnet is not released in the play store?
22:53 <+bridge> <learath2> The original android build was pretty janky to begin with
22:54 <+bridge> <robyt3> DDNet will likely never be on the Play Store
22:54 <+bridge> <jxsl13> D:
22:55 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea the original android build had blatant graphics issues
22:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> anyone could upload it to play store
22:55 <+bridge> <learath2> Fdroid release when?
22:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> fdroid! 🙂
22:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> why not playstore?
22:55 <+bridge> <Ewan> like when you'd switch out & back in lots of buffers would be full of random shit and they wouldn't be corrected by the game
22:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> graphics buffers i mean
22:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> video mammaries
22:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the new client is more epyc anyway, bcs it has vk support
22:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😏
22:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> i just finished spending 2 hours cleaning up a smoothie that i spilled all over my desk
22:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> and didn't even get any of
22:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tja
22:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> ama
22:57 <+bridge> <robyt3> Requires too much effort to satisfy the whims of Google's review bots, so I won't be investing any effort into that. Any other store front that allow auto-updating seems better than Google.
22:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i have/had apps on playstore
22:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's not that hard
22:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just all the questions about user data etc are bit annoying
22:58 <+bridge> <Ewan> TIL
22:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it's a onetime thing
22:58 <+bridge> <jxsl13> no
22:58 <+bridge> <jxsl13> google is pestering you like every year
22:58 <+bridge> <Ewan> they certainly aren't the first thing outsiders think of when they hear about C++ :P
22:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I see. but someone else could try
22:58 <+bridge> <jxsl13> to update your java sdk apps
22:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well sometimes
22:59 <+bridge> <jxsl13> or whatever sdk they provide
22:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think you're in a bubble. I know people who don't have that opinion about rust ^^
22:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but it's only about the target SDK
22:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we target the newest android
22:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so they would not annoy you for a few years
22:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> awesome 😁 implementation issue fixed by romething completely unrelated
22:59 <+bridge> <jxsl13> if there is a ci/cd pipeline, I'd guess that's just uploading tue release the
22:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> awesome 😁 implementation issue fixed by something completely unrelated
22:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but fdroid!
22:59 <+bridge> <jxsl13> the, then
23:01 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> cmon, last 13 players r sleeping
23:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> i might say the same for you. i know more non-rust devs who vocally feel that way about it than not
23:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao fokko never seen you so motivated for smth
23:01 <+bridge> <jxsl13> fokko, actively tell them to leave the server for an update :0
23:01 <+bridge> <jxsl13> sell them those juicy bugfixes
23:02 <+bridge> <jxsl13> lie that there are new features incoming
23:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> I just want the oneliner bug fix to be fixed cuz it fixes all the problems people can have (almost)
23:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
23:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> its literally breaking everything
23:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> UB
23:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> and its a beta server
23:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> dunno why cant just restart
23:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> with 13 player
23:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> cant, its passworded
23:02 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
23:02 <+bridge> <jxsl13> the chat is passworded?
23:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> THE SERVER
23:03 <+bridge> <jxsl13> I did not see that when I was there D:
23:03 <+bridge> <jxsl13> oh
23:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it's added so they leave
23:03 <+bridge> <jxsl13> Insee
23:03 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xd
23:03 <+bridge> <jxsl13> why the heck did you leave
23:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well in this discord for sure. but generally i have to say the programming language doesn't matter. i know lot of maintainers of other projects that are rather ignorant to bug reports & suggestions
23:03 <+bridge> <jxsl13> bruh
23:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> but it also doesn't really matter and this sort of thing really just depends on your exposure. can't deny that this perception exests, and is very prominent
23:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> actually this is the discord that i feel hates on rust for it the least
23:04 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257441792778047540/image.png?ex=66846b6d&is=668319ed&hm=26c266812b1631c5df2fa9b0d57b3f8d4c94a74cae73aa6641f2a6781846ffb9&
23:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> most of what i'm thinking about is from a community i was in years ago
23:04 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> i found that message again
23:04 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> lul
23:05 <+bridge> <jxsl13> you still on that beta server @cyberfighter ?
23:05 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> ye
23:05 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> im on some dead one
23:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> sick
23:05 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257442001885073528/image.png?ex=66846b9f&is=66831a1f&hm=92b7adf29fa7033ee58a2418c5249b19a0841e1a8534a51a4ff65d63a02c12c0&
23:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ah i thought that this server is most rust elitest xD
23:05 <+bridge> <jxsl13> tell those people to oeave for a restart
23:05 <+bridge> <jxsl13> leave
23:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so not about hate
23:05 <+bridge> <jxsl13> the get new features
23:05 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> it had 0 already
23:05 <+bridge> <jxsl13> amd bigfixes
23:06 <+bridge> <jxsl13> :'/
23:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my comment about bug reports etc is also more about ppl feel too elitest
23:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> instead of just being pragmatic
23:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean teeworlds is also best.. but damn the code sucks 😬
23:07 <+bridge> <jxsl13> that's elitist :0
23:07 <+bridge> <jxsl13> it works, hehe
23:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> wdym
23:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
23:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> ever since you drove voxel away there hasnt been much rest elitism backlash
23:09 <+bridge> <learath2> Rust has lots of evangelists. That's what creates the feeling. You ask a question about C/C++ in any programming space and some dude will pull up like a jehovas witness asking you if you've heard of Rust our lord and savior
23:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> C also has lots
23:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> altho they are a bit older and maybe lurk more in irc
23:09 <+bridge> <learath2> Jehovah's*
23:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think he was not mentaly stable, unrelated to this chat and probs stressed irl
23:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> ever since you drove voxel away there hasnt been much less rust elitism backlash
23:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes but you did drive him away
23:10 <+bridge> <learath2> You won't find our kind leaking outside of our own spaces
23:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😂😂😂😂
23:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> never watch a video called rust vs cpp
23:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> amem
23:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> amen
23:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rust al gaib!
23:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> you found something that genuinely got on his nerves, as benign as it would seem, and continued to push until he had to leave
23:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> not rly
23:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe that community wasn't that cool then, if it hates on random things. things to hate on is a very easy thing to build a group identity around
23:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes
23:11 <+bridge> <jxsl13> dune reference 👍
23:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah. i left when it became cool to hate on me :^)
23:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @mpft: when will you learn rust
23:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i was actually quite friend with voxel, i even paid him a comission for 50€ (way more than what he asks) at some point he begun to spiral down bad, he had a shitty job, etc
23:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the ddstats logo was the comm
23:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
23:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> if u truly felt like he was a friend you would have respected his boundaries
23:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> but making him mad was just so funny right
23:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well friends come and go, and no i didnt make him mad on purpose rly
23:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
23:14 <+bridge> <learath2> And even that didn't stop you from destroying them with the rust spam. Truly 😈
23:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
23:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tbf voxel was mad at a lot of things xDDD
23:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i still think its totally not related
23:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he also always been microsoft best
23:14 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i do miss him
23:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he was more mad at ddnet dev not being the way he wanted
23:14 <+bridge> <learath2> Oh yeah, voxel loved microsoft too
23:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> not "progressing"
23:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> reminds me of lynn
23:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> he/she/it got real mad too
23:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i knew this would come xDDDDDDDD
23:15 <+bridge> <zhn> lets push it down pls
23:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> you mean put it aside
23:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is push it down a expression?
23:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> til
23:16 <+bridge> <zhn> idk actually
23:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> nah but the intent is clear
23:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> I never met Lynn but I heard a lot about them
23:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he did some commit recently
23:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or she
23:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> some simple edit
23:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but complained others did not make what they wanted
23:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but still alive, epyc
23:17 <+bridge> <zhn> i remember making some commentary gender-neutral or something
23:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> voxel atleast made some nice changes
23:17 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah but i am also always mad
23:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs of backward compability
23:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im also always mad
23:18 <+bridge> <zhn> same
23:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> at memory unsafety :gigachad:
23:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and ppl that have no vulkan capable gpu
23:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> pf
23:18 <+bridge> <zhn> :troll:
23:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and no avx512
23:18 <+bridge> <zhn> you literally pointing at me
23:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> pff
23:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> who are you?
23:19 <+bridge> <zhn> your worst nightmare
23:19 <+bridge> <jxsl13> liking microsoft sounds sane to me.
23:19 <+bridge> <zhn> opengl 1.x gpu user
23:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> my whole day dream
23:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why u not on discord?
23:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> llvm pipe users
23:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> after my summer holidays
23:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
23:19 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'm back on discord
23:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1257445589537263646/image.png?ex=66846ef6&is=66831d76&hm=0cfe9fbf3dfb12743a19ec5c1349a6b7149d2a815289038d14ce29cd47407d9a&
23:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> serverbrowser bug. is it known?
23:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which version do you use?
23:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> after changing the quicksearch thing, it was fixed
23:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> 18.1, I guess I should update
23:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> I thought this was fixed long ago
23:20 <+bridge> <zhn> if someone will try to fix it please can you also fix width of server name on 5:4
23:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> even longer than 18.1 iirc
23:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> longer ago/before
23:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> do you literally have a 5:4 screen?
23:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> trust me I'm a native English speaker
23:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
23:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> are u a csgo user
23:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> who plays csgo anymore it's all about cs2
23:21 <+bridge> <zhn> nah i do have 21:9 one but im playing on 1:1, 5:4 mostly
23:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we really need ingame aspect ratio support.
23:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> changing native resolution sounds bit annoying
23:21 <+bridge> <zhn> better view for vanilla
23:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> "intent was clear"
23:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> what would it do jopsti
23:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> wdym
23:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it would give u 5:4 resolution but only for ingame rendering
23:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so UI stays at "normal" resolution
23:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nothing xD
23:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> would it stretch? can't imagine it would without stupid overhead
23:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> but the monitor does it in real time
23:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it stretches, no overhead
23:23 <+bridge> <Ewan> good
23:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's probably faster than the monitor
23:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @gerdoe: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7940
23:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you should test it out :D
23:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gfx\_ingame\_aspect\_ratio 1250 is what you would need
23:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> wtf
23:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> u already made it??
23:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah long ago when we had yet another 5:4 ui bug
23:24 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> yay updated
23:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> that is a rly good idea actually
23:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> jupstar gigachad
23:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/7940/commits/ea2076a615284132aa32de061b0fe42ff6a74ed9
23:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> drop native 5:4 and implement it ingame
23:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean it's 2 lines of code
23:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao
23:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> jupstar when amd fdr and dlss
23:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for 100k fps
23:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
23:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> fsr
23:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
23:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> zd
23:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> 480p ddnet
23:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
23:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i assume it's slower than direct rendering for entities
23:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> likely
23:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs the "AI" is not a cheap operation
23:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> like any upscaling/AA it'd need at least a little extra time, no?
23:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
23:26 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 why no ranks
23:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't trust it yet, and teehistorian hasn't been fixed
23:27 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> xD
23:27 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> k
23:27 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> it'll not crash
23:27 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> dont worry, didnt even crash with uninitialized memory
23:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> what time is it in Germany rn? do u have multiple timezones?
23:28 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> no
23:28 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> 23:28
23:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> ah
23:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> late
23:28 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> u
23:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am watching POR-SVN xdd
23:28 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> PORN
23:28 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> SV
23:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> :justatest:
23:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
23:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> BTW just kinda popped in my head, but what (in the code) is stopping ddnet from having >64 player support?
23:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> did spain win
23:29 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah
23:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they play against germany next
23:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
23:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 64 is like hardcoded everywhere
23:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fixed arrays everywhere
23:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fixed size
23:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye no dynamic mem
23:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just do a small vec
23:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> first 64 on stack
23:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just do a normal vec xd
23:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> then moved to heap
23:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> overengineering fun
23:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it is sometimes
23:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> who doesnt get mad excitement when abusing traits in rust
23:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i'd recommend against the tinyset crate
23:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's buggy xd
23:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
23:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> wtf? that can't be it
23:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> 1 search and replace
23:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its also in the protocol iirc
23:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> ah
23:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if we have no backward comp
23:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everything would be easy
23:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> suddenly coding would be fun
23:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and not pure pain
23:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xddd
23:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the sun would rise
23:33 <+bridge> <ryozuki> flowers bloom
23:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> penalty shooting
23:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rip
23:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if we accept no backward comp i promise to be active dev again
23:35 <+bridge> <learath2> I think then we lose heinrich
23:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
23:35 <+bridge> <learath2> You two are incompatible 😄
23:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we should just do 2 separate ddnet projects
23:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we could truly make ddnet 2
23:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> as voxel wanted
23:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i am ok with compability between database and maps
23:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at least for now
23:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well and physics
23:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well that is my plan anyway lmao
23:36 <+bridge> <learath2> We shouldn't. You think it's fun now, but when the novelty of breaking compat wears off we'll have one extra dead fork with hundreds of hours of devtime wasted
23:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why fork it
23:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> make it main
23:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
23:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why do you assume the new version wouldnt be liked more?
23:37 <+bridge> <learath2> If we had like 2 dozen activeish devs it may work out. But with just a handful of us it'd definitely be a disaster
23:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we have me
23:38 <+bridge> <learath2> Either way one of the forks will waste hundreds of hours
23:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet-cpp wouldnt need to be updated a lot anyway
23:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just as it is now
23:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ddnet 2 plan:
23:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
23:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> - remove backcompat code and monkeypatches
23:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> - remove ogl 1
23:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> - std 23
23:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> - future proof map format
23:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> - maybe more mod friendly
23:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> - rust for protocol codegen?
23:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> - port to postgres, remove mysql
23:40 <+bridge> <ryozuki> - add a predictable physics test framework
23:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> - accounts
23:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
23:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> there is rust std 23?
23:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
23:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
23:41 <+bridge> <ryozuki> edition 2024 in october
23:42 <+bridge> <ryozuki> game Launcher for better updates
23:42 <+bridge> <learath2> Personally I'd want to keep ogl1 forever. Let people use their toasters in peace
23:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nah
23:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> OGL1 is soo annoying
23:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the editor is so much faster without OGL1
23:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> can we make ogl1 behind a macro def
23:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
23:44 <+bridge> <learath2> It is annoying but it atleast runs on old hw
23:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and then xd
23:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we should do a hardware survery
23:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 2014 was 10!!! years ago
23:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we oldnguyst
23:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we old guys
23:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> browsers use ANGLE, which kinda is GLES on top of multiple backends afaik.
23:45 <+bridge> <learath2> These older devices also have buggy gl3 implementations which you'll blacklist and then tell people to buy new computers
23:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so i think it's not really needed
23:45 <+bridge> <learath2> I know you better than you
23:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they can just use old ddnet
23:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> since they use old hardware
23:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> makes sense
23:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xD
23:45 <+bridge> <learath2> They cant, you also want to remove all server backcompat
23:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i dont remove ddnet-cpp at all
23:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as said multiple versions
23:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2 ddnets
23:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> * ddnet for true gamers
23:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> * ddnet for middle agers
23:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> medieval ddnet
23:47 <+bridge> <learath2> People who can afford good hardware*
23:47 <+bridge> <._.spook._.> is there a thing that makes your screen darken for a certain period of time
23:47 <+bridge> <learath2> When rtx50xx requirement?
23:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well i am a maximist for overall happyness.
23:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
23:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if 99% of the players profit from it, then yes, poor 1% for staying in the past
23:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everyone can afford modern enough hardware
23:48 <+bridge> <learath2> 99% of players dont use the ogl1 backend. So they wont be affected badly by us maintaining it. Perfect
23:49 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you are correct, 99% dont use it, still we have to support it.. for exactly no gain at all
23:50 <+bridge> <learath2> Anyway, do it however you like for your personal project. I definitely won't +1 a pr that removes ogl1 anytime soon
23:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you dont listen to me anyway
23:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wont touch ddnet-cpp
23:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i want to split ddnet into 2 clients
23:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and 2 servers
23:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and if u want to give support for OGL1, do that
23:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> your time, your choice
23:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just like u want to make 1% of players happy, you can make me happy by supporting my plan
23:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean in the end that is what you want isnt it?
23:52 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> everyone should be happy
23:55 <+bridge> <learath2> Support in what way? I'm definitely not hosting a version of the server that players can't connect to without the very latest jupjupnet client. So can't help you on serverside adoption.
23:55 <+bridge> <learath2> 
23:55 <+bridge> <learath2> Best I can do is wish you good luck
23:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh weird, you want me sad
23:55 <+bridge> <learath2> It would atleast be interesting to see how many fps you can pull out of the newest gpus
23:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where is your happyness maximism now
23:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> you really think it's about fps alone?
23:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it's about all the code bloat
23:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet imo is very hard to maintain
23:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all the network extensions
23:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all the backends
23:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> all the useless features ppl want and are disabled by default
23:56 <+bridge> <learath2> Well that too, but you can't just slash out some features and say you reduced bloat. You did but we lost features too. Backcompat is a feature
23:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> see my project also sucks in many ways
23:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but at least these 3 things i tried to kinda fix
23:57 <+bridge> <learath2> I think it belongs in it's own codebase tbh. But it is a feature nonetheless
23:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> backcomp is just egoism of some ppl
23:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet 18 and ddnet 9 are 99% the same
23:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what do you miss in ddnet 18 that is in ddnet9?
23:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ddnet 18 works on all computers too, soon even android
23:58 <+bridge> <learath2> Fwiw I always played on the very latest client. It's not me that needs the backcompat
23:59 <+bridge> <learath2> The only thing I have an issue with about backcompat is that the burden of maintainance is on all of us, while very few actually use it and even less among the devs
