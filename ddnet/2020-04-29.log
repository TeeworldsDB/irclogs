10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Hey, could someone tell me how I can split in the sql database(record_points) that I get only the top 50-100 players?
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ORDER BY points DESCENDING LIMIT 100
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> But thats shows 1-100?
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I want to skip the first 49
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> OFFSET 50
11:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> LIMIT 50 OFFSET 50
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I love how mysql queries sound like you are shouting
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe I am shouting ðŸ˜› it's not case sensitive
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 do you happen to know whether interval BSTs are optimal for collision lookups?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> BST?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, I don't
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Bangladesh Standard Time
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> binary search tree ðŸ˜›
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds pretty good
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you do 2d bsts though?
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ``````
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> collision lookups was ambiguous there
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is not for 2d collision
11:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm upgrading a ghidra script so the largest match takes precedence
11:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need to keep track of the matches which are intervals and need to know whether they overlap(collide)
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> largest match?
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you do binary diffing?
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry, in a lecture right now, brain capacity severely reduce
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> d
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> sql full shouting
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you know findcrypt? the guy who ported it to ghidra really half assed it, it looks for crypto constants in the code, but sometimes there are constants in other constants, in that case I want the largest match to be the one used
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> no joke
11:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> btw. thanks @heinrich5991 :)
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. blowfish_p_init contains a constant from HAVAL
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 binary search trees definitely works well
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure why you'd want optimal here
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> *definitely work well
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, a linear lookup wouldn't hurt too much, I don't want the script to choke if someone pads their executable with dozens of copies of blowfish_p_init e.g. ðŸ˜„
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> KoG kicks for a lot of random reasons. I get a 10 min ban for chaning my config on kog or clicking a lill faster.
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> oh woops forgot to scroll responded to a super old context :D
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> binary lookup is log(n), should be fine @Learath2
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order (long list) links to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(mathematics) whhich is itself a long list ðŸ˜„
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> golang also implements regexp in linear time
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> didn't know backreferences were an np complete problem
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Is it possible to resume to text?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Like if I write smth and I go out and I want to resume?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Is it possible to resume to text?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Like if I write smth and I go out of text and I want to resume?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chat messages? I don't think so
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> yea
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Maybe add it to ddnet :3
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> In tw 0.7 is it already
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what happens there?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you still clear your chat line easily?
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> If you press right click and you are in chat, you are out of the chat
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> And you can resume with the text which you wrote already
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Sec
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> https://i.imgur.com/MOXneQQ.gifv
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, is it really worth it?
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Well, if you write while you play and someone try to save you
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> you have to write everything again
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u press enter
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then finish
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i do that between hammerhits
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm, I guess it could be useful, I'll take a look at the patch, if it isn't too large I'll do it tonight
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> check out the map `city_fce8eca0.map`, that one is quite fun
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 one more thing that would be cool is patching the dummy hammerfly so that the "is currently holding" flag is always 1
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> would make deepfly with dummy possible without any annoying binds
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what do you think about adding vulkan support to ddnet
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe ill try it as a fun project
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cl_text_entities_size doesn't work with opengl3.0 rendering?
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> turns all teles black for me
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @louis it does work, but requires client restart
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eh, vulkan might be overkill for teeworlds, not like opengl is missing anything we need or isn't portable
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does anyone here know how quad positioning works? as in how the quad coordinates mapped to the screen
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @heinrich5991 what about players-cache python3
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How have you people even been mapping if you don't know where the quads go?...
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Learath2 to the background :troll:
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well duh
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @jao true, still not done ðŸ˜¦
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> just tell me if you stop working on it
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> @Learath2
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> how hide chat im demo?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Crying `cl_showchat 0` ?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> ty
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> btw, any idea why changing the value of `cl_text_entities_size` makes any entities with text pure black until client restart?
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> no its dont need
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> ur first bind its good
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> its what me need
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Crying I know, that one is question to devs ^^
