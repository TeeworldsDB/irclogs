03:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Headshot do you have a similar problem? ^^
03:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> no, just kinda found that funny
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i had a similar problem before on an old laptop and i had to downgrade my graphics driver version to fix it
06:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <perrodecerro> why that maps ðŸ˜®

08:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Jupstar is alive?

10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Chillerdragon: your bot happens to also fight blockers, you won 3:0 ðŸ˜„
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> sounds like a threat
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 seems master1 is stuck somehow, last modified is almost 3 hours ago
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, we apparently ran out of space on ddnet.tw :/
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should be fixed in a minute
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oops, that out of space was my bad
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> didnâ€˜t know some service would get stuck
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That service should probably keep running if it runs out of space
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 could put /var/www-master on a ramdisk, would fix this problem
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the problem was that it crashed completely and didn't restart
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, so it should either be trying to restart or maybe just ignore the failed write and retry on the next try @heinrich5991
