10:05 <+ChillerDragon> its held by a lot of ducktape but my 0.7 sandbox feels kinda playable w ddnet client https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1676106302.png
11:25 < bridge> <Teero> is this a feature or a bug? üòÇ
11:25 < bridge> <Teero> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1073912557825441802/image.png
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> ?xd
11:26 < bridge> <Robyt3> It's normal, you are building with multiple threads so they can overlap or finish in a different order
11:26 <+ChillerDragon> ah u mean 9 10 9
11:26 < bridge> <Teero> yy
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> yea so running `make` fixes it :D
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> iv seen projects that actually depend on single threaded builds otherwise they wont compile
11:27 <+ChillerDragon> also what is ddnet_chill ? o.O
11:28 <+ChillerDragon> vserver
11:28 < bridge> <Teero> just a server with some mods :justatest:
11:29 < bridge> <Teero> definitely nothing suspicious
11:29 < bridge> <Teero> or worrysome
11:30 <+ChillerDragon> sus
11:30 < bridge> <Teero> well rn the only thing it does is segfaulting
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> classic
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> asan and gdb are ur friends :)
11:31 < bridge> <Teero> ig debugging multiple threads at the same time is still hard xd
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> oof threads
11:33 < bridge> <Teero> well precalculating 300k astar paths takes a little bit of time on one thread. but atleast it worked :(
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> any chance some admin could leak a production tcpdump? .-.
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> i can connect to ddnet bridge on localhost just fine but i can not reach any prod servers
11:43 < bridge> <Teero> debugging multiple threads at the same time is still hard xd
12:13 < bridge> <Teero> ChillerDragon: nvm it works :)
12:13 < bridge> <Teero> `[ -AStar-       ] : [ Did 196040 Astar Searches. Took 1 seconds ]`
12:14 < bridge> <Teero> nvm it works :)
12:14 < bridge> <Teero> `[ -AStar-       ] : [ Did 196040 Astar Searches. Took 1 seconds ]`
12:15 <+ChillerDragon> pro
12:15 < bridge> <Teero> :feelsamazingman:
12:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess `sizeof(int32_t)` is fine. I find it a bit more indirect, but it seems @Kaffeine likes it, more, so just go ahead with it, I'd say üôÇ
14:27 < bridge> <Kaffeine> Is there a special policy for reporting bugs causing the server crash? It seems to require a CON password to reproduce though.
14:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't think there is
14:59 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can DM me the bug report, if you want
15:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @Kaffeine ^
15:20 <+ChillerDragon> dont give it to heinrich he evil hacker
15:20 <+ChillerDragon> give it to sp someone he is trusted ddnet staff
15:47 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic
15:59 <+ChillerDragon> links without context is a censorable offense
16:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> open it nobo
16:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ur a offense
16:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with ur 0.7 port
16:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
16:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> is there a way to receive ICMP unreachable messages for UDP on windows?
16:24 < bridge> <heinrich5991> for linux, you can apparently set the `IP_RECVERR` `sockopt`
17:40 <+ChillerDragon> *insert offensive windows comment here*
17:54 < bridge> <Robyt3> Maybe by calling `WSAIoctl` with `SIO_UDP_CONNRESET` https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/winsock-ioctls#sio_udp_connreset-opcode-setting-i-t3 (no guarantee, I just asked ChatGPT)
17:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm, seems like this is simply enabled by default?
17:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thanks for the pointer üôÇ
17:58 < bridge> <Voxel> ask chatgpt to find bugs in ddnet
20:22 < bridge> <Sedonya> Is there any normal Anti-cheat from KRX?
20:23 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> from or for?
20:24 < bridge> <Sedonya> From
20:24 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> you mean you have krx and you want anti-cheat? Sorry I didn't understand.
20:25 < bridge> <Sedonya> I mean, I have a server, and I don't want people with KRX to come in
20:25 < bridge> <Nouaa> I didn't get it too
20:25 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah you mean for
20:25 < bridge> <Nouaa> so for*
20:26 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @noby
20:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> also can you edit your msgs so the name of the bot client doesn't show up (eg. replace it with "bot-client")
20:34 < bridge> <DefaultO> doubt you would get the detection method ddnet uses
20:35 < bridge> <Sedonya> I didn't understand much :P
20:35 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> rule #8 #welcome
20:35 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8
20:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> doubt you would get the detection method ddnet uses
20:35 < bridge> <DefaultO> because if not only ddnet has it. what would stop krx devs to get it and bypass these detection methods put in place?
20:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> doubt you would get the detection method ddnet uses
20:36 < bridge> <DefaultO> because if not only ddnet has it. what would stop krx devs to get it and bypass these detection methods put in place? would basically destroy the current anticheat.
20:36 < bridge> <Sedonya> I'm not promoting, on the contrary I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of cheaters
20:37 < bridge> <DefaultO> doubt you would get the detection method ddnet uses. because if not only ddnet has it. what would stop krx devs to get it and bypass these detection methods put in place? would basically destroy the current anticheat/make it useless.
20:37 < bridge> <DefaultO> I also haven't heard of any person that runs a non official server programming an anticheat.
20:37 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> yeah but the rule also implies to not share the name of the bot-client so please remove it (I also didn't know that till recently)
20:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> doubt you would get the detection method ddnet uses. because if not only ddnet has it. what would stop hack client devs to get it and bypass these detection methods put in place? would basically destroy the current anticheat/make it useless.
20:43 < bridge> <DefaultO> I also haven't heard of any person that runs a non official server programming an anticheat.
20:48 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @Sedonya don't mention bot clients by name. I removed your messages
20:49 < bridge> <Sedonya> Well
20:49 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://tenor.com/view/do-it-get-to-work-gif-21630516
20:50 < bridge> <DefaultO> (and you will probably get banned)
20:50 < bridge> <DefaultO> ||(and you will probably get banned)||
20:50 < bridge> <Sedonya> Nice üëç
20:51 < bridge> <Learath2> Kog and fokkonaut run a version of the antibot we use and nobys servers are where we extracted the antibot from in the first place
20:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> I mean KoG is big
20:51 < bridge> <DefaultO> if I would run a huge server network for some random game mode I like
20:52 < bridge> <DefaultO> and already got an anticheat, but would ask heinrich for yours, then I probably would get it as well
20:52 < bridge> <DefaultO> if I would run a huge server network for some random game mode I like. which gets played a lot by actual people.
20:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> I used those clients right after they updated for personal benefits outside the game world. And I probably know how you detect those.
20:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its more a trust thing
20:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> I used those clients right after they updated for personal benefits outside the game world (deving my own QoL client). And I probably know how you detect those.
20:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> qshar has been here for a long time
20:56 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ur kinda a random
20:56 < bridge> <DefaultO> I am not asking for it
20:57 < bridge> <Learath2> It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how we detect stuff. It's just thankfully beyond the capabilities of the current lot of skiddies
20:57 < bridge> <DefaultO> yea used the same terminology in heinrichs dms
20:58 < bridge> <DefaultO> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1074056827379134624/image.png
20:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> just ask chatgpt if this client with id x is botting
20:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> kek problem solved
20:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> kek
20:59 <+ChillerDragon> kek
20:59 < bridge> <Learath2> Smort
21:00 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> btw I am thinking about making a hand-wired keyboard with `Ajazz Diced Fruit Peach` switches and `Arduino Nano Compatible - CH340 Type-C` any heads-up or suggestions?
21:00 < bridge> <Learath2> Get ready to do a lot of soldering
21:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> ;) sounds fun
21:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> i mean for long term you probably want to have hot-swappable keys
21:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I'm planing to make it hot-swappable with `Crimp For Female Connector`
21:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> nice name
21:01 < bridge> <DefaultO> you just have to talk about the devil for him to appear
21:02 < bridge> <DefaultO> unless you typed it as a reaction to my reply
21:02 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I'm planing to make it hot-swappable with `Crimp For Connector -Female`
21:03 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> should I go with linear or with tactile switches if I want for it to be silent?
21:04 < bridge> <Learath2> I like tactile ones with o rings
21:04 < bridge> <Learath2> I almost always go for cherry mx browns
21:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> please have a silent keyboard if you use it near others
21:07 < bridge> <Learath2> Mechanical and silent don't really go that well together tho, maybe there are special linear switches made to be more quiet?
21:07 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/kagetane-hiruko-black-bullet-anime-evil-evil-stare-gif-15173289
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> good that we have ANC headphones
21:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd die without them
21:23 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> now I am between `Glorious PC Gaming Race Gateron Brown Switches` and `Ajazz Diced Fruit Peach`
21:31 < bridge> <ReiTW> blockworlds also, but abit different than yours
21:32 < bridge> <ReiTW> same but it's not a .so file, directly implemented
23:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://nullprogram.com/blog/2021/12/30/
23:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> > Some sanity for C and C++ development on Windows
23:43 <+ChillerDragon> i fully blame ms on that one they control windows and they work a lot in c++ they could have shared or pushed forward a c++ windows standard library
