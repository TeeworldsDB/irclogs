05:58 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> i think sp|someone found another bug, apparently announcements on ddnet only work in random order, in sequential order they get stuck on the last one
06:13 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp>
06:13 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> 
06:13 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> it seems like this can be fixed by just changing line 2787 from
06:13 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> `        if(m_AnnouncementLastLine >= v.size())`
06:13 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> to
06:13 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> `        if(++m_AnnouncementLastLine >= v.size())`
06:13 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> ??
06:16 <+jerry_> anyone here?
06:17 <+Learath2> sure
06:18 <+jerry_> Good i have a question: why does haisito! have no points?
06:19 <+jerry_> he's been around for a long time & finished many maps
06:19 <+jerry_> https://forum.ddnet.tw/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=1587
06:31 <+Learath2> think we gave him a rename
06:32 <+Learath2> yep we did
06:33 <+jerry_> oh that makes me feel a lot better
06:34 <+jerry_> thanks, i think a note when you search his name would be nice
07:50 <+ddnet-discord> <noby> he changed name to W'
11:48 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Anyone want to tell me how to properly cache stuff? https://gtmetrix.com/reports/ddnet.tw/tLiSQxXO
11:48 <+ddnet-discord> <deen> Otherwise I'll take a look myself later
13:30 <@heinrich5991> deen: do keys like pos1 etc. work for you on the ddnet servers?
13:47 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> @deen I activated caching for 1 day in nginx
13:47 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you can easily modify it in /etc/nginx/site-available/ddnet
13:47 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> https://gtmetrix.com/reports/ddnet.tw/hkYVKsQQ wants to have longer caching
13:48 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> if you want, you can tell me how long you want it cached, or edit it yourself
13:52 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you can enter "max" for "cache as long as you can", and these time suffixes: https://nginx.org/en/docs/syntax.html
14:20 <@deen> heinrich5991: what does that mean? pos1 key on keyboard?
14:20 <@heinrich5991> yes
14:20 <@heinrich5991> it messes up the command line for me
14:20 <@deen> not sure what i have a bind for on that
14:20 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vdLop
14:20 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 4fe6dc5 Dennis Felsing: Fix non-random announcements (thanks noby)
14:20 <@deen> ah
14:21 <@deen> didn't test maybe
14:21 <@deen> needs to be fixed then
14:21 <@heinrich5991> (I mean via ssh, not on the game servers)
14:25 <@deen> ah
14:25 <@deen> yes, works for me
14:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> https://imgur.com/LIzr4NI
14:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> cool
14:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ðŸ˜®
14:42 <@deen> wtf @Dr. Jekyll
14:42 <@deen> Crazy stuff
14:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> looks like good stuff for tutorial
14:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> part
14:46 <@deen> We were waiting with Steam release until the Tutorial is done. I think by now Steam Greenlight doesn't even exist anymore, haha
14:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> yeah greenlight has ended
14:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> replaced with something else tho
14:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yra
14:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but i guess
14:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you still can realese your game fom greenlight
14:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> you already have a submission on it?
14:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes
14:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> they had only to upload
14:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> files and  mke product site
15:23 <@deen> but without a tutorial ddnet is impossible to get started with
15:23 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that's right
15:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it looks like it's still possible to release ddnet through steam through greenlight
15:50 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it still shows up in the place where you can edit apps before publishing
15:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes, because ddnet had good opinions, it's not like they removed greenlight and every games
15:52 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> You got ability to release game. Anyway, now it would be more exepnsive if ddnet wouldn't be allowed
15:53 <@heinrich5991> deen: how long should images/css/js be cached on ddnet.tw?
15:53 <@heinrich5991> I used a conservative value of 1 day for now, but the site suggests longer time spans (and isn't too wrong about it, I guess)
15:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> In my opinion, it could be longer time. since you can just add version number to js/css
15:54 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it will be refreshed immediately
15:56 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> Do "server settings" (map tune zones etc) get loaded clientside ever?
15:56 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> they aren't, so far
15:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> Any barriers to me adding my own data into it and loading on client?
15:59 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> what kind of data? ðŸ˜ƒ
15:59 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> like - will servers just ignore data they dont understand
16:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> im changing group clipping areas to show/hide quads, so i need somewhere to store clip values
16:01 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> so you add clipping to layer groups?
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> yeah, modifying it on tune zone change
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> ah, you want to dynamically change it
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> I'm not entirely sure about the best place to put this
16:04 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> putting it into the server config is probably not the worst place
16:04 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> the server will just ignore improperly foramtted data?
16:05 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> it's stored as a list of console commands
16:05 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> console commands that are invalid aren't executed..... but they do output stuff into the console
16:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> what about hiding it in one of the unused info tables
16:08 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> you could also just add a new data item in the map
16:09 <+ddnet-discord> <heinrich5991> we don't have to search for space, the format was designed with extensibility in mind
16:35 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> a good ddnet tutorial would be really big, but if the tutorial only explains basics to be able to play novice imho its enough.
16:36 <+ddnet-discord> <Dr. Jekyll> that was roughly what i imagined
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/editor/auto_map.cpp#L346
18:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> is there a reason why this rand is not being seeded with srand?
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> just installed ddnet on a new setup, and it's running really nicely except that I'm getting 1 second frame drops every few seconds
18:19 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> anything obvious that could cause that?
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> vsync etc disabled?
18:20 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> also fsaa
18:24 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> yeah
18:24 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> fsaa 0?
18:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> os? updated gpu drivers?
18:29 <+ddnet-discord> <gdin> fedora 26, running bspwm with x11
19:29 <+eeeee> heinrich5991: 1 day sounds fine. it's not like browsers will reload the whole image every day, just means they'll revalidate it
19:30 <+eeeee> caching for more will reduce latency a bit, but i wouldn't do that unless we have a solid plan on how to e.g. hotfix the .js if we release a broken script accidentally
19:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> eeeee, ?ver=111
19:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> etc
19:32 <+eeeee> yes, adding git revision to filenames could work
19:32 <+eeeee> just saying we should probably have that in place first, and then we can increase the max-age or w/e
19:47 <@heinrich5991> deen: I guess a single timeout is nothing to worry about? ssh: connect to host rus.ddnet.tw port 6546: Connection timed out
22:12 <@deen> heinrich5991: unfortunately that's normal. we have never fully stable connections
