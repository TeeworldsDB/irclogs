00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> @deen right there buddy
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> I've just found out this old bug in github issues ðŸ˜„
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/32
01:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> didn't even know that was possible
08:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine having first class utf8 support, i wonder what language has it :bluekitty:
08:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Python3, Perl and Go? All great languages indeed
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :nouis:
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sql tests pog
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/922391461041942528/unknown.png
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Finally \o/
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you saying python a good language striked me as odd given ur angry against modules
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hehe
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nah they are all meh languages, I just wanted to intentionally omit rust for lulz
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluestripe:
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Perl is the best among those
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i never used perl :monkaS:
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I didn't use it much either, I only did very simple things with it. Heard it quickly becomes very annoying as programs grow in size
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is to be expected since perl is supposed to be a scripting language
09:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> what is the advantage of using perl when python exists ?
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The advantage is the ability to use a language that wasn't conceived by a 5yo on crack
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> lmaoo
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially the guy who wrote the module part of python and importlib, belongs in a mental facility
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> or maybe a gulag
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I seriously could fall off a building, hit my head, go to a bar get batshit drunk and still manage to write better scoping and import rules
10:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> ahah
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> y, sometimes import are cringe
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yet python is the most famous lang
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> i like python, but sometimes its ankward
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i agree imports are extremely confusing but i havent had problems with other stuff
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> same
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if there is a parallel universe where perl5 was implemented properly before python took over and if there is what sin have I committed to end up on the wrong side of the branch
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> :8_::15:
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust imports are rly good btw
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :bluekitty:
10:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rust imports are probably the best indeed
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> why are they getter ?
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> why are they better ?
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @b0th learn rust
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do you know c++?
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> y
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk they always worked
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> lel, its the essential i guess
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> First of all rust imports perfectly match the folder structure, no funny business, no compiler trying to merge stuff together
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> mmmh
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/922424348751581234/unknown.png
10:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/700263778599567420 here is my adventure trying to import two things that are similarly named
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye i remember
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> ahhhh
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> y it can be a big problem in python to import two different thing with the same name
10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heinrich has the exact same structure in libtw2 which is in rust, it works perfectly, you just import each with different aliases from different folders and everything just works out
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> ahah
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> y, `__init__.py` is bullshit
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> release python 4 with fixed imports
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> python4 will never exist xd
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I will one day if I have time actually make my own python implementation ripping out importlib
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just a small CPython fork
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No backwards compatibility to the mess of `__init__` from 1980s
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> xd nice idea
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> i hope Julia will become the next Python
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> it deserves :3_:
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Isn't julia too specific?
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> y maybe its too specific
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt julia load 100mb of ram for no reason for a hello world
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> but you can do a lot of thing
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i read it time ago on hn
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought it was mostly for data science people
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> in theory, it is
10:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually maybe if we make it popular enough data science people will fuck off to julia and we can have a nice python for people that are actually programmers
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://nim-lang.org/
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nimrocks :monkalaugh:
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is probably as close to a nice version of python we'll ever have
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if only it were more popular
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> there is V lang too
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> boo
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i heard bad things of it on hn
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i cant remember what
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> I heard it's not bad but I never used it
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah i think it tried to be safe like rust bust wasnt rly?
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah i think it tried to be safe like rust but wasnt rly?
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> i heard V lang from lynn on teehouse discord server
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> i heard V lang stuff from lynn on teehouse discord server
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> zig is pretty nice too if you are looking for a new language to explore
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> first thing i see on their website homepage is json stuff
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> so it has to be good :15:
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why is that so
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> zig is like C from the future ðŸ˜›
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> because on new langages i tried, like Julia for example, there is no fking JSON parser in the stdlib
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and there shouldnt be
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> xd
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its better for it to be decoupled from stf
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> std
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, it's common enough to be part of std lib imo
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> in 2021, if you write a script langage, it has to contains a JSON parser
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then u get a non efficient parser like the regex in c++
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz u cant update it
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz grandpas using it
11:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> xd
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> zig is not a script language tho
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well the problem with C++ is that it has no way to break backwards compat ever
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> These newer languages usually have things like editions
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also since json is actually standard a more performant parser won't be breaking anything really, so might even be possible without a compat break to keep a json parser updated
11:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is regex not standard?
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love this post https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/abi/
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> February 24, 2020
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The Day The Standard Library Died
11:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> The Day The Standard Library Died
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Making std::regex faster (it is currently faster to launch PHP to execute a regex than it is to use std::regex
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xdd
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > unique_ptr could fit in register with language modifications, which would be needed to make it zero-overhead, compared to a pointer
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Adding UTF-8 support to regex is an ABI break
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lmao
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the list goes on
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> c++ is fun
11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> lmaooo
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> i hate PHP :12:
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i havent used it yet thankfully
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> gg
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> only shit startups use PHP i swear
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> and Bisqwit
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol grumpy ppl always tell php is better than shiny ruby or nodejs
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> > WG21 will not promise stability forever
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yet they will block every proposal to ensure stability but they super promise to stop doing that in the future
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe in a decade or 5 they will super duper definitely break abi
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> classic old bearded man who doesn't want to give up the things he has learned
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a proposal, we create a very good compiler, infiltrate wg21 and wg14, then we form a vanguard party within the committee
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 im amazed google or m$$ havent done that
11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Take back the means of standardisation from the corporate elite
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They already have their claws in these committees, have you ever looked at the voting sheet for proposals
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> ðŸ˜®
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not rly
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never looked at that stuff
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The proposal to add overflow checked integers and stuff to C was blocked by a NVIDIA and HP coalition
11:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does integers wrap on overflow in c?
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> unsigned ones do, signed ones cause UB
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/922431296221884496/unknown.png
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This one is because C refuses to mandate twos complement for some bizarre reason I don't remember.
11:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The point of the blocked proposal was to standardize some form of `__builtin_add_overflow` which returns true if it overflows
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> loolll wtf
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> > WG21 wants to keep prioritizing performance over stability.
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Therefore they've blocked 2 decades of proposals to make `unordered_map`Â even remotely performant
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Revolutionary idea, this man might be the second coming of einstein
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/922434214924795914/Screenshot_2021-12-20_at_13.23.46.png
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> :Pepega:
11:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> big brain
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What do you mean we won't support linking to libraries built with Cfront or Turbo C++ wtf
11:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if it doesn't have 5 decades of support is it even a real language?
11:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> xdd
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I sometimes do actually wonder if these big companies do have internal tooling/libraries they've just lost the source to so they block improvement for everyone else
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just remember i did this <https://wiki.ddnet.tw/docs/>
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> remembered*
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ‘€
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> lol wtf
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> you did everything ? sheesh
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> mods will just unmute their friends while the 50+ server remains muted :P as much as is it annoying, I agree with @deen, not practical solution. might as well invest the effort into building a small portion of an account system to counter this ;)
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @SPYRES note that I closed it because deen implemented it
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> ah ok, will keep an eye out for mods unmuting anyone other than their friends ;)
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Where did deen say it's not practical? @SPYRES
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/922521293566378054/unknown.png
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> pretty much screams "not practical" to me
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> No it doesn't? He asked if it is really practical
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <SPYRES> but maybe he changed his mind!
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Well, it's better than the current state of everyone being muted for 5 min
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We need this to deal with persistent spammers with undetectable vpns
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> TsFreddie also has a issue open regarding sv_chat_initial_delay which could help #3894
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3894
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltLUadnCyi0
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> new video
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for the interested
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> could we have some filter system for maps in the editor ? like date or filesize ( and display that stuff )
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Sorah> I remember some admin saying he already made it but never added it =P
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @murpi thanks for testing out the new features ðŸ™‚
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> To access your database do you use microservices like a rest api ?
23:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> To access your database do you use microservices like a rest api ? I think no but i wanted to be sure ðŸ™‚
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
