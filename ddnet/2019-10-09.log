14:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yourenglishteacher> How difficult will it be to implement a swop with player feature like in dota 2?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <K1LL3RBR41N> why is my server saying WARNING: No master servers. Retrying in 60 seconds
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yourenglishteacher> Check your internet connection

16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Mr_Anderson seems like I am not the only one?
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> @K1LL3RBR41N what type of connection are u trying to host from
18:21 <+bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> hi :/

18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> fok quakenet
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why are stoppers not glitched as fuck without prediction? Of course you bounce around a bit, but I had in mind doing something like this and you would clientside just fall completely through and after you move a bit you jump back to the server position
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <K1LL3RBR41N> @onby  what u mean ?
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <K1LL3RBR41N> @fokkonaut  0.7
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Well, I can update ddnet7 to teeworlds master. There is a commit that shouldnt break this, but until now this fixed it for me
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> are u hosting from a vps? ur own connecttion? etc
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @K1LL3RBR41N pull and build again
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and try again
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <K1LL3RBR41N> did same
