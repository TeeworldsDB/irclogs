00:11 <@deen> hi
00:11 < Yensu> hi
00:12 <@deen> add_vote "Pados 3 by Pados" "change_map \"Pados 3\""
00:12 < Yensu> I will try this rq
00:12 <@deen> For the proper server type you have to disable cheats
00:12 <@deen> sv_test_cmds 0
00:13 <@deen> Has to be in your config
00:14 < Yensu> K, it is showing up as DDrace now, but my vote for maps isn't working
00:15 < Yensu> my map is named YY_SP_1
00:15 < Yensu> my map is named YY_SP_2
00:15 < Yensu> my map is named YY_COOP_1
00:15 < Yensu> my map is named YY_COOP_2
00:15 < Yensu> my map is named YY_COOP_1
00:15 <@deen> add_vote "YY_SP_1" "change_map YY_SP_1"
00:15 <@deen> and try moving the map to the maps directory
00:15 < Yensu> k, I will try that
00:15 <@deen> where the other maps are
00:16 < Bossk> Deen german?
00:16 <@deen> yes
00:16 < Bossk> [23:42] <Bossk> Ich habe einen part für Ice Cave gemappt  und für genau das tileset, welches DoNe fürn freeze hat ist kein automapper verfügbar, selbst bei ihm [23:42] <Bossk> deshalb frag ich mich wie er das gemacht hab 
00:16 < Bossk> :D
00:16 <@deen> keine ahnung
00:16 < Bossk> total bescheuert ich weiß nicht wie ich das machen soll
00:16 <@deen> Du musst nur Gametiles mappen
00:16 <@deen> sonst gar nichts
00:17 < Yensu> I only speak english. But yeah, that worked, I will have to write down how to change maps
00:17 <@deen> Yensu: You can add that to your config
00:17 <@deen> And yeah, I should probably generate a documentation with all commands
00:18 < Yensu> that would be nice
00:18 < Yensu> I made a txt document for future reference
00:18 < Bossk> Ah, somehow his image is named "round-tiles_2" and not just "round_tiles"
00:18 < Bossk> there it works tss
00:19 < Yensu> how do people vote for a new map if they're not familiar with my maps?
00:20 <@deen> ???
00:20 < Yensu> is there a way to show all possible maps to vote for?
00:20 < Yensu> or is there a way to vote for random map?
00:20 <@deen> They are in the votes window, right?
00:20 < Yensu> oh, yeah, sorry I'm returning to the game
00:20 < Yensu> I didn't know that was there
00:21 <@deen> Yes, for random votes:
00:21 <@deen> add_vote "Random Map" "random_map"
00:22 < Yensu> thanks a lot, this helped <3 you should make a forum for DDnet. I know you have trac, but that's not something I'm familiar with.
00:22 < Yensu> also, you should have a list of server commands ;)
00:23 <@deen> Hm
00:23 <@deen> There are about 10000 teeworlds forums, don't want another one
00:24 < Yensu> lol
00:24 <@deen> but yeah, server commands will be there
00:24 < Yensu> I just didn't know where to go specifically for DDrace info
00:24 < Yensu> I did post in the normal forums for modifacations and someone guided me to DDnet.tw  so, I guess it helped but it's very broad
00:26 < Yensu> Are you often in this chat?
00:26 < Yensu> If I ever need help again?
00:26 <@deen> Yeah
00:27 < Yensu> k, well I am trying to host a US server for DDrace with my custom maps, anywhere I can advertise? I know a few people have come and enjoyed my maps, but I would like to be more known
00:27 <@deen> Well, you could also send the maps to us and maybe we would add them
00:27 <@deen> See http://trac.ddnet.tw/
00:27 <@deen> But otherwise I don't know
00:27 <@deen> There are not many american players
00:28 < Yensu> sadly
00:28 < Yensu> okay, I will make some finishing touches before I try adding them to the trac, but when they are ready I will try
00:29 <@deen> Okay, cool
00:29 < Yensu> may I ask where you are from?
00:30 <@deen> Sure, Germany
00:30 < Yensu> I've considered moving there, but I was told not to from Germans saying it's competative in the workplace especially if I'm not fluent in German
00:30 < Yensu> so I gave up on the idea
00:31 <@deen> I don't know much about that
00:31 < Yensu> I would love to live somewhere in Europe. But all my family is here
00:32 < Yensu> But, I will stop bothering you, I'm headed out anyway
00:33 < Yensu> thanks  for the advice
00:33 <@deen> you're welcome
08:43 < Yensu> got another question for you if you're here
08:43 < Yensu> Can you bind DDrace commands, AKA, can I bind pause to a key, if so how?
08:44 < Yensu> I know you can bind kill with "bind X kill" but it doesn't work with specific DDrace commands
09:31 < Yensu> I got disconnected, not sure if you answered the question, it was can you bind DDrace commands? can you bind pause to ak ey?
11:11 < Yensu> I assume if I made a custom skin, others wouldn't see it, right?
11:38 <@deen> bind x say /pause
11:38 <@deen> and right about the skin
12:03 < Yensu> can you bind admin keys as well?
12:03 <@deen> yes
12:03 <@deen> bind x rcon up
12:04 < Yensu> and the up/left/right/down are cheats right? so you have to have cheats on
12:04 <@deen> Of course
12:04 < Yensu> k, thanks
14:17 <@deen> Yensu: http://ddnet.tw/settingscommands/
15:31 < Yensu> cool
16:24 < Yensu> someone recommended I use iDDrace for the dummies. How different is it from the DDnet client/server? Does it just add dummies?
16:24 < Yensu> Though I suppose it's someone else that is making that, so you don't support it?
16:24 <@deen> Hm
16:24 <@deen> I think iDDRace builds on DDRace
16:24 <@deen> So it doesn't have all the new stuff ddnet has
16:25 <@deen> Everything you see on http://ddnet.tw is missing
16:25 < Yensu> hmm, I can deal without dummies. It's fun when you're alone though
18:33 < Yensu> So, I can't seem to find the block you can shoot through but can't walk through. Maybe I just missed it. I found the one that makes you hover, you can shoot through it, but can't go through it...
18:33 < Yensu> but there is a solid block you can shoot through right?
