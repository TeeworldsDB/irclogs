21:14 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 9ca7651 H-M-H: fixed path to look for SDL2 on OS X
21:31 < vottak> someone alive here?
21:31 <@deen> vottak: hi
21:32 < vottak> deen: oh hi deen! i have some questions
21:32 < vottak> how much traffic per month need for one ddnet server? and how to add my server to official servers team?
21:33 < vottak> i want to buy one, because i hate lags  on russian server
21:36 < vottak> deen: 
21:36 < vottak> u here? :o
21:40 <@deen> vottak: yes, sorry
21:40 <@deen> https://ddnet.tw/stats/server/
21:41 <@deen> Check this, it has network bandwidth graphs for each server, on the top right is the weekly graph, look at the sum values
21:41 < vottak> deen: so, 1tb per month is normal?
21:41 <@deen> no, 1 TB per month is only normal for GER, the others have less
21:42 <@deen> also, there is no way to add your own servers to official servers. the official servers are all set up and run by the ddnet admins themselves
21:42 < vottak> ah
21:42 <@deen> where are you located? why do you have lags on RUS?
21:42 < vottak> rus server have shit admins
21:42 < vottak> all time server loaded on 95%
21:42 <@deen> we have the same admins everywhere
21:43 < vottak> and all time that server have lags
21:43 <@deen> that's the first i hear of that
21:43 < vottak> you dont play on russian servers
21:43 < vottak> german server is best
21:43 < vottak> but not good ping
21:44 <@deen> we could definitely use a better server in moscow
21:44 <@deen> do other people also have lags?
21:44 < vottak> yes
21:44 < vottak> i think, its because out of resources
21:44 <@deen> but it's not out of resources, I see it at 0% CPU
21:45 <@EastByte> typical vps instability issues or DDoS attacks
21:45 <@deen> anyway, if you have a better vps in moscow and could provide me root access I could set it up as a new DDNet RUS to replace the old one
21:46 < vottak> not replace
21:46 < vottak> just to add one more
21:46 < vottak> to balance 
21:46 <@deen> i don't like to have two servers in one location
21:46 <@deen> complicates things
21:47 < RafaelFF> Hello there.   bra.ddnet.tw  Internet connection went down.  'dmesg' returned "nf_conntrack: table full, dropping packet", which I assume to be related to DoS attack. Trying to get it up again.
21:47 <@deen> RafaelFF: strange, i don't remember setting up any iptable rules on BRA
21:47 < vottak> deen: russia is big
21:47 < RafaelFF> p.s.: system is up, just the Internet connection is down.
21:47 < vottak> :D
21:47 <@EastByte> nf_conntrack table full indicates ip spoofing attacks
21:48 <@EastByte> deen: linux does udp conntracking by default
21:48 <@deen> vottak: but most live close to moscow
21:48 < RafaelFF> Any suggestion? I'm kinda noob in this security area.
21:48 <@deen> at least we have very few players from eastern russia
21:49 <@EastByte> RafaelFF: I don't think there is anything you can do against DDoS attacks
21:49 <@deen> RafaelFF: i didn't see an attack on BRA
21:50 <@deen> I would guess it's a shared kernel and someone else is getting a ddos, if it's one
21:50 < vottak> deen: its not for rusian players only, because all people who live around moscow have better ping on russia servers
21:51 <@deen> RafaelFF: iptables -L to check if there are any rules
21:52 <@deen> you could also try increasing the nf_conntrack: http://www.pc-freak.net/blog/resolving-nf_conntrack-table-full-dropping-packet-flood-message-in-dmesg-linux-kernel-log/
21:53 < RafaelFF> iptables rules: https://gist.github.com/josephgbr/8e0425b3038ba493abbbe9828fd99edb
22:03 < RafaelFF> There is a tcpdump.sh in root's home folder. Is it DDNet's?
22:04 <@deen> yes
22:04 <@deen> used that once to record dos attacks
22:04 < RafaelFF> ok.
22:08 < RafaelFF> Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
22:08 < RafaelFF> 0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0         U         0 0          0 venet0
22:08 < RafaelFF> Is this expected in a VPS? I dont see gateway defined.
22:09 <@EastByte> it's normal for OpenVZ containers I think
22:10 < RafaelFF> Ok.  Well, iptables and conntrack modules are not enabled, according to lsmod (messages stopped after rebooting), and I can't get any route to work.  Maybe the problem is in the host
22:12 <@deen> what do you mean, you can't get any route to work?
22:13 <@deen> If I ssh to bra.ddnet.tw I can ping other servers just fine
22:14 <@EastByte> RafaelFF: in an OpenVZ container lsmod should be empty
22:17 < RafaelFF> oh, it is up again. I wasn't able to ping bra.ddnet.tw nor I was able to ping out from Virtual console. But, indeed, It is up again
