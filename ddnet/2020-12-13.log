00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> killall DDNet-Server
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen wanna add libpng to the ddnetlibs repo?
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then i'll implement it later
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ✪ sure, I can do that
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> libpnglite seems not to be used by anyone except Teeworlds, which is not ideal
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats funny xd
00:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but libpng is not alot harder anyway
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it just has more control about what todo if u got 16bit images and stuff like that 😄
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would you say this looks dangerous
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> str_copy(m_aFilename, "", sizeof(m_aFilename));
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ```
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why not m_aFilename[0]=0
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well its already in the code 😄
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just found it while looking through a pr
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if its even doing smth
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> guess it does what it should 😄
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just looks strange 😄
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @deen under debian openctm-tools also uses pnglite xD
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/787482255807348736/unknown.png
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon
01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> rlly
01:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> waste of a call, tho I'd imagine the compiler inlines str_copy very aggressively
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ciger> Is there FNG2 mod for Windows?
08:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not precompiled if thats what u try to ask
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod/tree/fng_06
08:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also added cmake support lately, but never tried mingw
08:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ciger> Need developing?
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can pm you with a build if you want
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else you need to add the cmake modules from ddnet in order to work for mingw to compile
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ciger> is it team or solo?
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @ciger just read the fng.cfg
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it explains almost everything
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ciger> thanks 🌹
11:11 <+ChillerDragon> wat is that my code @fokkonaut? _:D
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/DDnetPP/DDNetPP/blob/621969e0cfa6e6a205b6807a578678f17967af21/src/game/server/entities/character_dummymodes.cpp#L3470
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> good stuff :D
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Have any of you ever read a wikipedia arbcom case? It's fascinating how organized wikipedia is. It's like a court case
12:04 <+ChillerDragon> are you paid to collect donations for wikipedia? o.O
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 wikipedia is rly well organized and a good effort to provide knowledge to ppl
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yet ppl make fun of it all times
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what a sad world
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the fourth byte in the CTile struct used to represent tiles in the tiles/game/front layers is called m_Reserved and isn't used anywhere in the ddnet code
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> though there are 5 ddnet maps where this byte is set at least once
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> does anyone here know if there ever was a tool/client/editor/whatever that used that byte?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Patiga heinrich is ur best bet
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i doubt anyone else knows xd
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i use it in fng, but not from editor point 😄
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> at runtime only
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @Patiga what are you planing todo with it? 😄
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> "types/brutal/maps/Indicud.map": Tiles layer (at index 6 in group 6) has an invalid tile: Unused byte of tile at x=300, y=449 isn't zero
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> "types/brutal/maps/Rogue World.map": Tiles layer (at index 7 in group 12) has an invalid tile: Unused byte of tile at x=112, y=396 isn't zero
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> "types/brutal/maps/Tropical Island.map": Tiles layer (at index 0 in group 6) has an invalid tile: Unused byte of tile at x=360, y=356 isn't zero
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> "types/dummy/maps/SpookyDrag.map": Game layer (at index 2 in group 6) has an invalid tile: Unused byte of tile at x=152, y=138 isn't zero
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> "types/insane/maps/New Generation.map": Tiles layer (at index 12 in group 7) has an invalid tile: Unused byte of tile at x=133, y=31 isn't zero
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ```
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oop sry irc
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> its just that my map parser now errors on ddnet maps
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so i guess i repair the ddnet maps ^^
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can't u ignore that byte 😄
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why would it error on a reserved byte?
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> since reserved means that it could be used in the future
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> so it should be 0 for now
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so thats why it shouldnt error
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> future proof
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> hm
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i dont go that far with forwards compatibility
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i mean i might do that for this exact problem if it happens on too many maps
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> but if there are few enough maps i would rather fix the maps
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well maybe it was uninitialized for these maps in some editor version
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Patiga I would check old ddrace client
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It could be an artifact from the port to 0.6 which introduced a lot of changes
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> the repository ddnet is based on?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think so ddrace/ddrace iirc
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://github.com/DDRace/teeworlds this one?
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think we didn't ship a separate map conversion tool back then, so it should be part of the client if it ever was used
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> huh seems to be completely unused
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> TIL you can do `git log -Sm_Reserved` to get all commits that change a line with that string
12:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga not sure how the implementation was, but maybe we kept this byte uninitialized accidentally
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> interesting, I'm currently figuring out how many maps in the archive have this problem, the number seems to be below 100 though
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ~50 occurrences in the map archive
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> i think with such a low number i would rather keep it as an error, fix the ddnet maps if that is okay
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Patiga you can send me the fixed maps
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Go is easy to use: https://github.com/def-/adventofcode-2020/blob/master/day13a.go
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Robert just went god mode
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/787678869184446525/unknown.png
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what is that?
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2825
14:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, fancy
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can learn go in 1 day
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly ez
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Phorravie> Hello everyone, where can I download the trainfng server. (fng server withh /spawn and /team commands).
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Phorravie> can't find
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://github.com/35niavlys/teeworlds-trainfng
15:32 <+ChillerDragon> SpookyDrag seems to be a new map also the other map names sound new so i doubt it is a artifact fr from DDRace/teeworlds times
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You know what would make me extremely happy? If spotify would stop breaking google cast every other day
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What level of incompetence is required to break something 5 times a week?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> spotify mobile is so broken too
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i watch one of those dumb "watch this video and you won't have ads for 30 minutes" and it gives me ads 5 minutes later
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast we don’t get ads with spotify premium anymore, that was one annoying bug
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @Learath2 I have a mac now
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Apparently mac can render ime cocoaview the fine on top of fullscreen games?
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Apparently mac can render ime cocoaview just fine on top of fullscreen games?
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eeeeh sometimes, if it feels like it
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Oh
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> That's worse than not being able to at all
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :realsmiley:
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Oh well I can't find anything about ime for mac
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is no information for most anything about mac, your best bet is to form a company developing apps, become extremely popular so you can get enterprise support and ask apple
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or reverse engineer appkit like I did
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :cirBlech:
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> I guess windows is at least somewhat ok in term of exposing data
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There definitely is a way to get the data out of the IME
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> On mac?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://developer.apple.com/documentation/inputmethodkit?language=objc I spent a couple hours digging around here
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you just need to figure out what obscure or hidden api they are using to get a handle to the IMKServer
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :realsmiley:
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Never done mac stuff before.
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After you have a handle it's not too hard to get the candidates out. I gave up after 4-5 hours digging around in AppKit, but radare2 is sooo slow with a 30MB binary
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TsFreddie intel mac or arm mac?
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Intel mac
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Is my 2017 macbook pro. My mom was using it before.
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should get an arm mac sometime
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They say the performance is quite great
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I doubt I'll ever have the money for one, Apple is always out of their minds with their pricing
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Ye. Macbooks are pretty expensive tho. I don't think I'll get a new one any time soon.
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe I can trade in a kidney for a Macbook
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :realsmiley: online trade in, mail your kidney
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :realsmiley: contactless trade in, mail your kidney
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> This is funnier
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Phorravie> I can't figure out how to start this server (need LAN sv_register 0) where is start file like a DDnet_server.exe https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod/tree/fng_06
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you need to compile it yoursef
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> you need to compile it yourself
18:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Phorravie> so good, but what is needed for this and what order of actions can there be a guide?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> do you only have cl_chat_old now?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @deen pls I need some help
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @Learath2 could also help
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I finally want to PR color picker (cool feature ofc) but the thing I stuck at is editboxes. I don't undestand how to use them
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I need an editboxes like in editor with all editor features supported. `HEX` editbox and `Clamped Number` editbox
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @Phorravie readme.md has full tutorial, isn't it?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @Phorravie readme.md has full tutorial, hasn't it?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> I thought you wanted to say that DDNet has a documentaion on their code and nearly died out of laugh
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lul
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Editboxes explaination pleeeease 🙏
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> what don't you understand about them?
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @Learath2 how to make them actually... I made a HEX editbox and convert value from it, but I need a way to create only allowed characters and set max length
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> How can I do it?
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> uf, idk did you check how cinaera did it for the original color thing in editor?
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if not I would just check after every change and if the new character(s) aren't valid delete them
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <b0th> yo everybody, someone is pro in PHP xD ?
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @b0th https://dontasktoask.com/
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/787742614077308928/unknown.png
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Well, nice `DrawCircle()`
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Who broke it?
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Worked perfectly before I've updated to ddnet-master
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> ok, it somehow didn't clear the texture now, fixed
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Phorravie> @gerdoe ohhh tnks
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @b0th what do you need
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyone have any experience working with massive datasets and visualising them?
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to extract audit data from the entire teehistorian archive but it gets MASSIVE, a couple of months I can just put in json and use very naive O(n) algorithms on but even that makes my website sloow
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 web?
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see the fancy people use R for statistics stuff
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.r-project.org/
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, I'm wondering how things like elasticsearch handle their massive datasets e.g.
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I obv can't make the user download almost a gb of raw data to display, so I need to either paginate or precalculate at the server
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 what exactly u want to visualize?
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and what would be an example for a search query
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u want to view X player run on x map?
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe build some kind of index
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk tho im not an expert
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have moderator actions
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I want to visualize them over the "calendar" sort of like github does for your commit activity
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ur current aproach is?
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bundle the entire activity log and use js to filter/query it
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe u can extract data from AUTH_LOGIN to AUTH_LOGOUT
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> O(n) filtering, O(n) lookup
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> js :pepe_straight:
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually I think I can make the dataset much much much smaller so I can visualize for now
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> filter AUTH_LOGIN TO AUTH_LOGOUT and strip everything that isnt a CONSOLE_COMMAND(-10) ?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Still want to know if anyone has any ideas working with these kinds of things though. Do you do processing on the server? How much do you send the client?
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i doubt anyone sends 1gb of data to a client
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Despite what you think I'm obviously not retarded 😄
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That is why I'm asking how people usually work with these datasets
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet already works with a kinda big dataset doesnt it? ranks teamranks and the website
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that's true, we put it in a database where we can easily have indexes and we pre calculate wherever possible
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't do much visualisation though
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/787784320341114900/unknown.png
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lags a bit when u select 6 months or more tho
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> too much data i guess
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there anything I've promised to do but haven't yet? I've already wasted most of this day, might aswell waste the rest
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @deen could you give me teehistorian archives?
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Do you save inputs of player who did not finish map?
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> Probably not ...
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We save all inputs
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why do you want full access?
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> @deen wanna parse them and find cheaters
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> If you save all inouts, even when player did not finish it could show some interesting results
