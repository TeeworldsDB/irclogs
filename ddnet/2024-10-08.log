07:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> A little early innit
07:41 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I know the language im doing advent of code in :santatrollet:
07:42 < bridge> <teero777> Imagine
07:42 < bridge> <teero777> morning üåÑüåÖ
08:14 < bridge> <matodor> there a lot of generated names, like 5 symbols random strings
08:24 < bridge> <matodor> there a lot of generated names, like 5 symbols random strings 
08:24 < bridge> <matodor> 
08:24 < bridge> <matodor> p.s ok you were talking about the ddnet base
08:32 < bridge> <avolicious> I guess it stores namechanges during the Game too?
08:33 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah. I guess if he played for at least 5 seconds or something he is in the list already ^^
08:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In pm furo told me even with a Finnish that were like 1.9m.
08:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
08:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> With at least 100 points it were around 100k
08:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In pm furo told me even with a finish that were like 1.9m.
08:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
08:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> With at least 100 points it were around 100k
08:41 < bridge> <totar> what is the order based on?
08:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The order in the video?
08:50 < bridge> <totar> yeah
08:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I shuffled it, so random
08:50 < bridge> <totar> ah
08:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In pm furo told me even with a finish that were like 1.3m.
08:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™>

12:07 < bridge> <__fredy__> ty
12:15 < bridge> <__fredy__> i used sv_register 1 but its not making my server public
12:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> Did you port forward ?
12:21 < bridge> <__fredy__> oh i thought there is 2 ways to make it public, mb
12:22 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks https://rust-gpu.github.io/
12:24 < bridge> <__fredy__> can i know what should i type in "internal ip adress"?
12:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah it's based on https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu

12:34 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
12:35 < bridge> <teero777> so much effort
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Uff, when I try to have the debug console of chromium open while I scroll in our skin database i get

12:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chrome 0day? :p
12:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Apparently chrome changed smth about max xmlhttp requests
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i wanted to dbg it
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But no chance xD
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Dunno üòÑ
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
12:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But only happens if console is open, so maybe a bug in the debugging tools
14:36 < bridge> <__fredy__> can anyone help me please, how to fix this problem? I just want to make public server

14:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if you don't understand this msg, use google
14:57 < bridge> <__fredy__> i used already, i did a lot of things and nothing
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wont help you to bypass the protection of yout NAT tho
14:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it doesn't look like you host the server on a VPS
14:57 < bridge> <__fredy__> what is vps
14:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://google.com
14:59 < bridge> <__fredy__> so how can i host the server on a vps?
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> buy a vps
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> read tutorials
14:59 < bridge> <__fredy__> cant i host without vps?
14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> you can, but i wont help you with that. ask others
14:59 < bridge> <__fredy__> eh üò¶
14:59 < bridge> <__fredy__> alr thanks
15:00 < bridge> <murpi> Maybe https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2474013400&searchtext=server helps
15:03 < bridge> <murpi> But yes, you need to open port 8303 (or to whatever sv_port is set to in your config) in order to register the server in the internet tab.
15:03 < bridge> <murpi> and to do that, you need access to your router interface, if you don't know how, then either read your routers manual or google the routers brand
15:17 < bridge> <__fredy__> i did everything there and still no results...
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Even if you did everything right, there is a chance that your internet provider simply doesn't allow it
15:20 < bridge> <murpi> Since you've did everything, can you screenshot your routers port forwarding interface which clearly displays you've opened port 8303?
15:22 < bridge> <__fredy__> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1293201825448591471/image.png?ex=6706838d&is=6705320d&hm=b4d7f4c888b1fb6410480b02c7e56f5ccb685e770b52e87988613c16c2c7c04a&
15:23 < bridge> <murpi> and does the internal IP address match the local IP of the device you're using to run the server?
15:23 < bridge> <murpi> (screenshot that too) ^^
15:25 < bridge> <__fredy__> yes its 100% right, i have copied that ipv4 address from cmd
15:27 < bridge> <__fredy__> yes its 100% right, i have copied that ipv4 address from cmd and typed it there
15:27 < bridge> <__fredy__> yes its 100% right, i copied that ipv4 address from cmd and typed it there
15:27 < bridge> <murpi> Can you screenshot that? Just making sure
15:30 < bridge> <__fredy__> ill dm you, ok?
15:30 < bridge> <murpi> Sure
16:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 @jupeyy_keks @heinrich5991 any weird language u find interesting to learn? for the upcoming https://adventofcode.com/
16:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> maybe ill learn ocaml
16:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> go-lang
16:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> this lang is also rising https://odin-lang.org/
16:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i already know golang

16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do at least one puzzle in the GPU
16:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with risv-v
16:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> if i dont find a interesting alternative ill probs try zig too

18:21 < bridge> <shootxen> I create the PR to let you do the job? üëç
18:21 < bridge> <teero777> that would be called an issue

21:29 < bridge> <learath2> https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344037263_A_Direct_Proof_of_the_Riemann_Hypothesis I found this on youtube üòÑ
21:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> what did youtube say?
21:35 < bridge> <jxsl13> about that paper
21:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And where is their mistake?
21:39 < bridge> <learath2> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7POSJlOLgs
21:40 < bridge> <learath2> I don't know enough math to say that, but I'm fairly certain nothing "obvious" was missed with this problem given how long it stood üòÑ
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean where is the flaw in the proof xd
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:41 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Was it all so easy or what?
21:42 < bridge> <learath2> As said, I'm not the calibre of mathematician required to critique this guys proof. All I'm saying is that it's unlikely someone found a simple direct proof that fits in 7 pages and can be demonstrated on geogebra üòÑ
21:43 < bridge> <learath2> and it's even more unlikely that someone that solved a millenium problem refuses to post in an established journal
21:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ah yeah, looks to good to be true, him just casually using some paint skillz :lol:
21:44 < bridge> <learath2> but hey, maybe I'm wrong and the riemann hypothesis is actually proven true, either way win win üòÑ
21:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I have to assume they just want some attention. My brain doesn't allow it
21:46 < bridge> <totar> I think this dude has been talking about his "direct proof" of the remann hypoethesis for a long time now
21:47 < bridge> <learath2> His last update video starts off by saying the original paper had a mistake in it that could be shown with simple algebra, so he fixed it to this current version by reducing the proof to a single lemma
21:48 < bridge> <totar> idk you would think if his approach had any merit then it would have been confirmed by now
21:48 < bridge> <totar> also lol
21:48 < bridge> <totar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPSFiL-q_1s
21:49 < bridge> <learath2> if he was close people would flock to fix and complete his proof
21:49 < bridge> <totar> exactly
21:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this is 2020. if this had any merit, you would have heard of it already
21:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what everyone else already said
21:50 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nvm
21:50 < bridge> <learath2> Last update is Sept 24 2024, he fixed the "trivial issue" reduced it to a single lemma üòÑ
21:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Fake it 'til you make it üò¨
21:51 < bridge> <jxsl13> directly disproven: Grigori Jakowlewitsch Perelman
21:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> iirc arxiv.org
21:52 < bridge> <learath2> He was an eccentric person, whose proof was confirmed mostly quickly and furthermore it wasn't 5 pages
21:52 < bridge> <learath2> üòÑ
21:52 < bridge> <louis> there are a lot of schizo marhematicians
21:52 < bridge> <louis> vixra is a fun place to find them btw
21:53 < bridge> <learath2> Actually this paper is quite short, I wonder if you could type it up in something like Coq and have the computer check it
21:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> kog mentioned
21:54 < bridge> <learath2> Then you could write a paper on how this supposedly trivial proof of riemann hypothesis was disproven using computer assisted proof tech
21:54 < bridge> <learath2> or Lean 3 or sth
21:54 < bridge> <heinrich5991> nah, that doesn't work
21:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> only the reverse works
21:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can't say a proof doesn't work just because you weren't able to formalize it in lean
21:56 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, that's interesting. Can't you somehow show that you did formalize it properly? As in show the equivalence between the papers claims and your formalization?
21:56 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, that's interesting. Can't you somehow show that you did formalize it properly? As in show the equivalence between the papers claims and your formalization

21:56 < bridge> <heinrich5991> two problems with that
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> My professor proved his statements by saying "trivial".
21:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's my spirit.
21:57 < bridge> <learath2> The proof is trivial, alas too large for this margin, it's left as an exercise for the reader
21:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> a) no, you can't. that's one of the fundamental problems of formalization. you can't show that the model you have corresponds to what you want to have
21:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> b) even if it has the correct model, that doesn't mean the absence of a proof means anything ‚Äî it could just be you being too stupid to fill in the gaps the author left
22:00 < bridge> <learath2> Interesting, I would have thought proofs like this one would be rather simple to put into computer language, then a computer can check whether the claims hold at each step
22:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> a paper proof is almost never detailed enough for a computer to check
22:00 < bridge> <learath2> IOW whether atleast the papers claims are valid under the assumption that all it's assertions hold
22:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you always have to fill in the gaps
22:01 < bridge> <louis> aint they working on formalizing the riemann hypothesis in lean or something
22:02 < bridge> <learath2> I see, interesting. I've never seen a computer assisted proof done except for examples so complex that I can't follow
22:02 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try proving something really trivial from your first semester
22:02 < bridge> <learath2> the four color theorem is probably the only one that comes to my mind
22:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I actually like working with proof assistants üôÇ
22:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> kinda like a small puzzle game
22:03 < bridge> <learath2> Which one would you suggest playing around with?
22:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> lean is the hip shit, I heard
22:03 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I mostly worked in coq so far, but would try lean nowadays
22:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> one of the first things I did after going through various coq tutorials was proving that a group is commutative if each element is self-inverse
22:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this was slightly nontrivial but still interesting
22:04 < bridge> <learath2> Say I filled in "all" the gaps/hidden assumptions in this mans proof, would it still not be enough to show that this paper doesn't hold?
22:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if you filled in all the gaps, then you'd have the proof
22:04 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so there must be some gap missing
22:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this is probably where a false statement appears
22:05 < bridge> <learath2> hm, maybe I misunderstood the word "gap" there
22:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can find that counterexample if it's simple enough
22:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but if you do, the answer is going to be that this doesn't matter for the correctness of the proof
22:05 < bridge> <heinrich5991> and that you just need slightly different assumptions
22:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (which is also something that happens for actual mathematics btw, that statements have slightly wrong assumptions, but the whole proof still works if you correct them)
22:06 < bridge> <learath2> Is it not possible to show that a gap is "unfillable"?
22:06 < bridge> <learath2> I'm guessing not in general
22:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can sometimes prove that statements are false, yes. but since this is a well-known hypothesis, both a proof and a proof of the inverse are very hard
22:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> so if you construct your fake proof well enough, the person trying to show that your proof doesn't work has to almost prove the riemann hypothesis right or wrong
22:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> to conclusively prove that you're wrong
22:08 < bridge> <learath2> I see, that makes some sense yeah
22:09 < bridge> <learath2> btw my favourite mathematical problem ever is the Collatz conjecture. I really hope one day we have a beautiful proof for it
22:09 < bridge> <learath2> not one of those billion page computer generated proofs, nor a 2 sentence counterexample üòÑ
22:11 < bridge> <totar> some of the very hard long standing problems are in a little gap between the problem having sufficient complexity to encode a turing machine, the problem being solvable. So you end up almost running into the halting problem but not quite
22:11 < bridge> <learath2> It does feel very closely related to something like the halting problem though, so idk maybe it can be shown to actually be impossible to prove
22:11 < bridge> <totar> some of the very hard long standing problems are in a little gap between the problem having sufficient complexity to encode a turing machine, and the problem being solvable. So you end up almost running into the halting problem but not quite
22:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> concrecte examples are probably not impossible to prove
22:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> *for concrete, non-constructed, examples, it's probably hard to prove that it's impossible to prove
22:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> but turing showed really early that the generalized collatz problem is equivalent to the halting problem
22:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Impossible is just the lack of entering the world of infinity
22:14 < bridge> <learath2> What sort of generalization are we talking about here?
22:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> instead of 2 cases, choose n cases and give a polynomial step formula for each
22:15 < bridge> <heinrich5991> IIRC
22:17 < bridge> <learath2> I read about busy beaver numbers a couple months back, it's such an interesting way to "quantify" complexity
22:18 < bridge> <learath2> Proving the Collatz Conjecture is as hard as computing BB(15) apparently
22:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 What do you think, how many percent of today's known math do you know?
22:18 < bridge> <fantrapreal> Hi
22:18 < bridge> <learath2> Probably less than 10%, say 10 with all the curiousities I skimmed over my life
22:18 < bridge> <totar> wow really? bb(15) is absurd
22:18 < bridge> <fantrapreal> can anyone recommend gameskin?
22:19 < bridge> <learath2> Try #general or #questions
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> default is legendary
22:19 < bridge> <fantrapreal> Opps sorry
22:19 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> try that
22:19 < bridge> <learath2> >  There is a 15 state Turing machine that halts if and only if a conjecture by Paul Erd≈ës (closely related to the Collatz conjecture) is false. Hence if BB(15) was known, and this machine did not stop in that number of steps, it would be known to run forever and hence no counterexamples exist (which proves the conjecture true). This is a completely impractical way to settle the conjecture; instead it is used to suggest that BB(15) will be very h
22:19 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 10% sounds like too much IMO. even for some math researcher
22:20 < bridge> <learath2> I guess it's hard for me to estimate that percentage given I don't know what I don't know
22:20 < bridge> <learath2> So that 10% is more like, I know some things about 10% of the math I've heard about ever even in passing
22:20 < bridge> <heinrich5991> the longer text states the opposite: computing BB(15) is at least as hard as proving the collatz conjecture
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's still interesting to philosophy about such questions.
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We probably cannot even comprehend how much math there is xd
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What do you think, how many percent do you know? :DD
22:21 < bridge> <totar> If you consider the ability to understand the cutting edge math of any subject in under a week I think Tao knows more than 10%
22:21 < bridge> <totar> just because he hasn't read every paper ever seems unfair to say that he only understands <10% of mathematics
22:23 < bridge> <learath2> Hm, perhaps I misremembered, it's been months since I took a gander at bb
22:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> terence tao is a genius
22:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> good read https://gwern.net/doc/iq/high/smpy/1984-clements.pdf
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Possible.
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> What I often notice in software development is, how many libs we don't know but depend on.
22:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So much _random_ code that is actually used by many ppl, but I never heard of.
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ofc some code solves the same problem as others. But generally there are always new things.
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So if you say ok, but if you know most stuff about CPU arch and GPU arches and how memory works and what do I know, how much do you really know then?
22:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Possible.

22:26 < bridge> <learath2> To be fair, isn't it fact that there is no consistent system of axioms that can prove all truths of natural numbers? So some of the true things will never be provable
22:26 < bridge> <totar> Idk it's hard to find a parallel to Terence Tao is the computing world
22:26 < bridge> <learath2> So there is "math" if you can even call it "math" that we would never be able to ever explore üòÑ
22:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's also kinda two sided. A good kernel dev might understand the problems of a "normal" program. But does that make him a good developer in this field? üòÑ
22:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> Terence Tao competes against great mathmaticians, and he is alive, probs the best math guy in the world rn
22:27 < bridge> <totar> software is mostly about labor than it is deep insights.
22:28 < bridge> <totar> I think there's probably many software engineers who given enough years could replicate the linux kernal, but no one has time for that.
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well is that so? üòÑ
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do you learn by doing this labor? If you can learn from it, what is there to learn if it's just about doing stuff üòÑ
22:28 < bridge> <patiga> gg
22:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> well there are many great software guys
22:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> alan turing
22:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot the other big name
22:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @patiga gg
22:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> omg
22:28 < bridge> <totar> I don't mean computer science, I mean software as a practical industry
22:28 < bridge> <totar> the part that has a $10 trillion dollar value
22:29 < bridge> <learath2> Well there is still theoretical computer science going on, with many deep insights required
22:29 < bridge> <learath2> Software engineering is just putting pieces together, so yeah, that is a little less "deep" I guess
22:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> software practical industry is driven by computer science imho
22:30 < bridge> <totar> yes but those deep insights alone do not get you to useful software
22:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> but they kind of do
22:30 < bridge> <louis> the field of computer science is hugely influenced by industry moreso than pure mathematics
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah I can defs understand your point. It seems like development doesn't require huge skills, since so many ppl can create useful stuff.
22:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> a language like rust is based on computer science, the borrow checker is literally a paper
22:30 < bridge> <totar> there is no deep insight you can have that lets you reproduce the linux kernal in a week or a month
22:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Probably bcs our computers are so fast üòÑ
22:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> with lot of theory
22:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> and rust is useful software
22:30 < bridge> <totar> I'm talking about the ratio of theory:work
22:31 < bridge> <learath2> I just had a very deep insight that will allow me to do that
22:31 < bridge> <learath2> `git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git` üôÉ
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And do you feel the theory is needed to invent smth like Rust?
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or could you just do it and do the theory later? üòÑ
22:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/stacked-borrows/paper.pdf
22:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust lies strong on the theory to prove its safe
22:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> in its definition of safe
22:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> engineering is just an application of science
22:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> there are ofc good engineers
22:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> imho its 50/50
22:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> LLVM the best compiler in the world, along gcc is powered by its R&D
22:33 < bridge> <learath2> After looking into making my own, I can confirm that just going at it is not possible unless you are like a savant for whom it's immediately obvious
22:33 < bridge> <learath2> If you are not careful and don't have a strong theoretical background you immediately run into the halting problem trying to implement a borrow checker üòÑ
22:34 < bridge> <totar> just because you can use theory to make software doesn't mean it's necessary. strictly speaking you could write every program in C with enough time, and the end user would not notice
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> its true tho that a lot of science papers are crazy and ignore completly how a computer works in the real world
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> and dont do optimized algorithms
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> whathever
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> what i mean is sometimes they are far fetched fro mreality yes
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> but there is some practical stuff
22:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> (for example, of useless things: galatic algorithms)
22:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_algorithm
22:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> yes. g√∂del's incompleteness theorem
22:35 < bridge> <learath2> There are more theoretical papers and there are more concrete practical papers, I've seen both kinds in the wild
22:35 < bridge> <totar> like if you make a program will only run if you input the lean proof of the Poincar√© conjecture and then say that "see you need theory in order to make software"

22:36 < bridge> <ryozuki> > An example of a galactic algorithm is the fastest known way to multiply two numbers,[3] which is based on a 1729-dimensional Fourier transform.[4] It needs O ( n log ‚Å° n ) {\displaystyle O(n\log n)} bit operations, but as the constants hidden by the big O notation are large, it is never used in practice. However, it also shows why galactic algorithms may still be useful. The authors state: "we are hopeful that with further refinements, the algo

22:36 < bridge> <cellegenrih> mind you, im NOT implementing it in Tee Galaxy
22:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> i recommend u read the biography paper i sent
22:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> its rly interesting
22:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> he was identified as a genius and was raised as such, not ignored
22:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> lucky to have rich parents tho
22:37 < bridge> <totar> Tao is very impressive because of his breadth, it's hard to say if there is an equally smart mathematician who only focused on one subject their entire career.
22:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> His research includes topics in harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, algebraic combinatorics, arithmetic combinatorics, geometric combinatorics, probability theory, compressed sensing and analytic number theory.[4]
22:38 < bridge> <learath2> Well not all theory fits to computation. You can't really "just make" an AI without understanding any theory. AI is about as close to "just theory" as you can get
22:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> his dedication must've been insane

Tao remains the youngest winner of each of the three medals in the Olympiad's history, having won the gold medal at the age of 13 in 1988.[25]
22:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> god damn, at the age of 9
22:39 < bridge> <cellegenrih> young neilson would shit itself
22:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> hmmm. rust is a very practical language I think, very distant from academic languages. it tries to solve real-world problems, such as interactions with C, something that academics are largely unconcerned about
22:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah, i dont disagree (?)
22:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it still relies on a lot of CS, just like other languages
22:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> i wish they made a movie about tao
22:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i seen the ramanujan one
22:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> i like seeing movies about smart ppl
22:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
22:42 < bridge> <totar> I think all theory does fit in computation, by definition. Even cutting edge AI research doesn't not require math knowledge as deep as physics or other areas, most people can learn all the math for transformers in a couple years it's not insane stuff.
22:42 < bridge> <learath2> What does it mean to be the "best" mathematician anyway? He is exceptional in his field but is he say better than everyone in every subbranch of mathematics? Is he the best to ever live? Is he "better" than say Euler e.g.? or Ramanujan?
22:42 < bridge> <teero777> @totar tell tao to invent better ultraforce if you see him around
22:42 < bridge> <totar> lol
22:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk
22:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> the nice thing is he is alive

22:43 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And you are young

22:43 < bridge> <totar> it's hard to understate how good Tao is. There's a joke where mathemeticians who are struggling on a problem would could spend their time more productively by trying to get Tao interested in their problem. Even if he knew nothing about it previously.

22:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 dont u think the current problems in the math world are the highest difficulty? since usually by logic the older stuff tends to be "easier" and discovering "new" is harder
22:46 < bridge> <totar> it's hard to overstate how good Tao is. There's a joke where mathemeticians who are struggling on a problem could spend their time more productively by trying to get Tao interested in their problem. Even if he knew nothing about it previously.

22:46 < bridge> <ryozuki> ? xd
22:47 < bridge> <learath2> Well, that's by definition, as our understanding of a field improves there is less and less low hanging fruit. But the problems Euler faced at his time were also the hardest of his time.
22:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> if i have a kid he will probs learn rust or whathever future safe gcless lang there is
22:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
22:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And if your kid doesn't like computer science?
22:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> then he can go kick a ball
22:47 < bridge> <ryozuki> it will be sad but thats life
22:48 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i think parentsh ave lot of influence on what a kid likes

22:50 < bridge> <teero777> What annoys me the most is the current standard of physics. We always use models that are supposed to represent real life behavior but are pretty annoying to deal with since it won't be 100% accurate and if you want to simulate something over a longer time the solution will become so inaccurate that it is unrecognizable. But people just accept that.
22:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> most kids dont even know about "code" itself
22:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> or how a program is made

22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 Ok last question, then I rq.
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Do you believe in _sudden_ geniuses?
22:51 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Like let's say until 35 you sucked hard in math, but suddenly you like it insanely for no reason and are super good and still do smth epyc?
22:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i hope thats me
22:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> two potatoes awaiting the teachings
22:52 < bridge> <learath2> I think the young lads say touch grass or sth. It's very good for you
22:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> i need to master math someday in my life
22:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> but i got no time
22:52 < bridge> <jxsl13> mash our brains
22:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> math is the programming language of the world
22:52 < bridge> <teero777> make it rhree
22:52 < bridge> <teero777> make it there
22:52 < bridge> <learath2> There is one of those people I've read about. Sucked at math until uni, took a class in uni accidentally, loved it, won a fields medal
22:52 < bridge> <totar> happened once to a guy who got a concussion from pool diving, maybe try that
22:52 < bridge> <teero777> I don't think you can represent all of nature with math
22:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> i believe u can
22:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üëå Cya later
22:53 < bridge> <fantrapreal> you mean the world was made by mathematical process?
22:53 < bridge> <jxsl13> :0 it's too profound. Is it the naivity?
22:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> i mean you can describe all the world by math
22:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> and if so, probs what u said hold true
22:54 < bridge> <fantrapreal> I got it
22:54 < bridge> <teero777> Math is made up by humans to describe the world around us I don't think it is able to describe everything as it is right now. I'm pretty sure there is behavior that you cannot describe with our current "set" of math. So it will need to get extended over time
22:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> i also believe there is no destiny all is predetermined by a nearly or infinite state machine, whose input before was all the atoms or whathever particle is the smallest, and it produces an output
22:54 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'm old btw
22:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> üò¢
22:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just so complex it looks like its ur own decision
22:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> to move ur hand
22:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> to write here
22:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> but no
22:55 < bridge> <learath2> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Huh
22:56 < bridge> <teero777> An atom is also just a model we use to describe nature. We have no idea if we are correct. It is just that it fits with everything we have seen so far
22:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> I liked maths before university
22:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah thats why i said whathever particle is the smallest
22:56 < bridge> <louis> i mean it depends how much of 'math' u mean by math
22:56 < bridge> <fantrapreal> what would a world be like without mathematics?
22:56 < bridge> <louis> like are u including random variables, statistics, etc.
22:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> SAT
22:57 < bridge> <learath2> Thou shalt touch grass, or thou shalt end up talking about mathematicians at 11pm on a week night
22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory
22:57 < bridge> <jxsl13> Dayjob is so far away from theory as can be.

22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> did i tell u yet i love isaac asimov
22:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> good read https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~gamvrosi/thelastq.html
22:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> "let's fix the http/s proxy parameter not being set"
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://libraryofbabel.info/
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> this library is made with maths
22:58 < bridge> <learath2> Wait, so you do believe in destiny?
22:58 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1293316652854673498/image.png?ex=6706ee7e&is=67059cfe&hm=8a3f36c44dd1caa08d462ff698d1c51334d8c9d31347a91f29a4f10193741cf1&
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> it holds all the info in the world
22:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> and all the possible books
22:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> babel was iirc before the internet
22:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> well not in the romantic way
22:59 < bridge> <teero777> Wait what?
22:59 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1293316802201391144/Screenshot_20241008-2258332.png?ex=6706eea2&is=67059d22&hm=180f4965419179a93f6e0a91c357b8a92b4674e1d18ca4ba3c2e3cdf8f073f28&
22:59 < bridge> <jxsl13> now they got a website
22:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> in the way of our brain is made of chemicals that drive how we act
22:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
23:00 < bridge> <teero777> The website is fake tho
23:00 < bridge> <learath2> https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?a:524
23:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> im watching the office on the side screen
23:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> how so
23:00 < bridge> <totar> do you guys think there will be super intelligent computers within the next 5 years that will replace all of us?
23:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> no
23:00 < bridge> <fantrapreal> Yes
23:00 < bridge> <ryozuki> @teero777 https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?jtpxuv_vvy69
23:00 < bridge> <fantrapreal> Bcs why not¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
23:01 < bridge> <learath2> No, there will be medium intelligent computers that'll replace all of us within 2026
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> Idk i have searched for stuff that shouldn't exist because the character set doesn't support it but it will still give me an output
23:01 < bridge> <totar> Sam Altman said there will be ASI in <3000 days
23:01 < bridge> <totar> which is about 5 years
23:01 < bridge> <learath2> Companies don't need many medium smart people, they need a handful of very smart people
23:01 < bridge> <teero777> Atleast the search function is not legit
23:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> sam likes marketing
23:01 < bridge> <totar> it's true
23:01 < bridge> <jxsl13> same as elon
23:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> where is the tesla roadster
23:02 < bridge> <totar> but also I give him a little bit of credit because he might know more secrets about ai than the general public
23:02 < bridge> <totar> all the models that openai release seem to be delayed by 1 year
23:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> you can give him credit in case he lives in a basement and programs all day
23:02 < bridge> <teero777> I don't think the current theory is good enough
23:02 < bridge> <totar> they had O1 since last october
23:03 < bridge> <learath2> This I don't buy. Unless he has a secret unpublished novel AI
23:03 < bridge> <totar> except they did for the last years
23:03 < bridge> <totar> except they did for the last year
23:03 < bridge> <totar> their most recent release was secret for a whole year
23:03 < bridge> <learath2> but all signs point that pouring more and more data into the models has exponentially diminishing returns
23:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> they seem to be hitting a boundary there
23:04 < bridge> <totar> but inference time scaling is a thing now
23:04 < bridge> <learath2> They'd need to be doing something extremely novel under the wraps
23:04 < bridge> <teero777> Except there is some crazy new theory on how to do AI without transformers I do not think this is going to happen
23:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> they do kind of layer their models
23:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> sam is fake
23:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> he wants mony
23:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> which might improve training time
23:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> did u see those e/acc guys? xd
23:04 < bridge> <learath2> https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04125 I read this a while ago, it's quite a decent read
23:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> this for sure
23:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism
23:05 < bridge> <teero777> lol
23:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> time to invest into nasdaq?
23:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity
23:05 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
23:05 < bridge> <learath2> but I'm fairly sure a lot of computer engineers will be replaced within 5 years. We are just not very efficient at our work
23:06 < bridge> <fantrapreal> :gigachad:
23:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> i hope im not replaced, i know rust
23:06 < bridge> <totar> ok but consider that some people who left his company founded a new company called to make a "straight shot to safe superintelligence" it's such a bold claim that surely they think they have a chance right?
23:06 < bridge> <learath2> You are a bit more safe as you are doing some novel work, you'll at least be needed to prompt the AI
23:06 < bridge> <jxsl13> I'm like super chill and learath2 totally not sarcastic there
23:06 < bridge> <totar> ok but consider that some people who left his company founded a new company to make a "straight shot to safe superintelligence" it's such a bold claim that surely they think they have a chance right?
23:06 < bridge> <jxsl13> 100% real
23:07 < bridge> <totar> they're not even going to release anything to the public, they're just gonna make super ai and then get money
23:07 < bridge> <jxsl13> this is the point where you might wanna touch some grass
23:07 < bridge> <learath2> if they actually manage to make super ai, the super ai will manipulate them into putting itself in charge and murder all of us
23:08 < bridge> <learath2> See I'm telling you, it's still not too late to fix your lives
23:08 < bridge> <teero777> Imagine some math and energy takes over humans
23:08 < bridge> <learath2> Software engineering is dying anyway, we'll all be replaced by offshore prompt farms and AI
23:08 < bridge> <totar> I was touching grass yesterday I'm done for the week
23:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> make some fries then
23:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> üëÄ
23:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i want to see amovie about this
23:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> distopian
23:09 < bridge> <totar> idk it seems like you guys are pretty skeptical which is what I was curious about.
23:10 < bridge> <teero777> I discussed with @jupeyy_keks recently how it would be nice for time to be ~stopped so you can cod e and create new things indefinitely.
23:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> I have seen apes pressing random buttons somewhere in a movies.
23:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> tbh the pinacle of tech dev wuld be that no person on earth has to work and there is no scarcity, but we are greed personalized so it wont happen

23:10 < bridge> <jxsl13> I have seen apes pressing random buttons somewhere in a movies.
23:11 < bridge> <totar> my dads company outsources a lot of work to overseas because the executives want to save money and he always complains about it, so I'm not too worried
23:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur a company boy?
23:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> get out!
23:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> we have the same problems
23:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
23:11 < bridge> <totar> no
23:11 < bridge> <totar> the company where he works at
23:11 < bridge> <totar> he doesn't own it
23:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> ah
23:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
23:11 < bridge> <learath2> The second technology gets that good the people who own it will wall us off and live in tech utopia while we graze fields and trade with them to stay alive
23:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> ur safe
23:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> for now
23:11 < bridge> <totar> I don't work for him either
23:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> :nouis:
23:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> what dou you do :0?
23:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> freelance?
23:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> megacorp?
23:13 < bridge> <learath2> He farms taters ofc
23:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> in texas?
23:13 < bridge> <ryozuki> texas <a:aPES3_EmuRide:827518329408192523>
23:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> howdy pals!
23:14 < bridge> <totar> it's a small company, I work remote. If I said the industry or what it is you could find it instantly xd
23:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> when i ehar texas i think of this
23:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2AC41dglnM
23:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> he says texas
23:14 < bridge> <teero777> @totar do you own a gun to defend yourself if the taters act up?
23:14 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh its american interrogation day
23:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> we used to do this to gdin
23:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> taters are the ruling class
23:15 < bridge> <totar> I already got rid of all the other Taters so I don't need it
23:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> @gdin hi
23:15 < bridge> <teero777> @gdin hii
23:15 < bridge> <jxsl13> fritoes are the underlings
23:16 < bridge> <teero777> What did you do? :justatest:

23:19 < bridge> <ryozuki> wat
23:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> you just waiting for the sleep paralysis to stop
23:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> somehow
23:20 < bridge> <teero777> I can still hook
23:20 < bridge> <jxsl13> bro, what is the topic here, even
23:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> what is this fever dream talk
23:23 < bridge> <jxsl13> *more ideas for the pixar movie*
23:24 < bridge> <teero777> Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?
