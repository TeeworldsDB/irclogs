08:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> time to learn 6502 asm
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why? It is fun, but not much use to it
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you porting ddnet to NES? 😄
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Is there some tooling to turn proprietary binarys into compilable code? My employer forces me to run the zoom desktop app -.- I would feel way less comfortable if I could generate some C code with ghidra or something like that that then compiles into zoom is that possible?
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Is there some tooling to turn proprietary binarys into compilable code? My employer forces me to run the zoom desktop app -.- I would feel way less uncomfortable if I could generate some C code with ghidra or something like that that then compiles into zoom is that possible?
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> what's the point
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I mean even if you decompile their binaries you'd still have to check for some shit
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> and you already know how bad zoom is
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its just emotional at this point
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i understand that i would not have variable names etc but at least i could try chaning some shit and recimpile right?
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> sounds easier to me than hook into the raw binary
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> still what's the point
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> 1st you can break the app itself, 2nd afterall you send your data to them
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ye i wont get around 2nd i accepted that even for discord still i feel much better here
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i dont understand 1st?
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> at my job the guy in charge of the cybersec asked to disallow zoom, we got forced by the administration
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Do you know if its possible?
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Does decompiled code compile to a similar functioning binary?
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, that's generally not possible
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can't you use the web version of zoom??
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can't you use the web version of zoom?
09:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they use some dark patterns to not show you the web version, but I've generally been able to use that
09:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> omg shit
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> is the web version new btw? Last time i checked it was not a thing
09:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> then im sending all my cookies to zoom o.O
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the web version is at least as old as the pandemic AFAIK
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh wow
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> weird
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they do use some dark patterns to steer you away from it
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> what is that xd
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> like only showing you after you interacted enough with the site to show that you 'tried launching the desktop app'
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cookies are something the zoom webservers ask you to send back when you reconnect
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can launch it in private mode to disconnect your sessions
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the zoom web app, in a private browser window, I mean
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ghidras decompiler is very capable, but even that isn't remotely close to producing fully compileable code, let alone a complete reproduction
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh sad
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> mr NSA entered the conversation
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> you contributed to ghidra didnt you xd?
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> the web app looks kinda functional still would be cool to run a selfcompiled desktop app instead
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have bad news for you: v
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have bad news for you: https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/pull/1889
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> et tu mi fili
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> joke
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i think its cool
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Me and @heinrich5991 are coworkers??
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> OwO
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> o/
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> onlything bad about ghidra is java \:D
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> rest is fine
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Accursed Java why must it become popular 😭
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so bois then get to work and fix ghidra decompiler
09:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thanks
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do normal humans wake up and be operational this early in the morning??
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its 10 in my timezone
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also 10 here, woke up at 8
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> isnt it fair to assume to be functional 2h after waking up!?
09:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its my prime
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe I have some sort of brain damage
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> no u just proper hacker who works in da nite
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> with mate and hoodie
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and im soy dev with morning routine and starbucks coffe
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> using nodejs and vscode
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wait Learath are you on mac rn?
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Phone, waiting for lecture
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 3 hour lecture on circuit theory :AnyaSob:
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> go leak what lecture
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> is it any fun?
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh boi
09:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's more fun than math analysis. Less fun than any computer related lecture
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> pog
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm also starving
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> was asking about if u got enough hotdogs
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also cant get food because the vending machines only take coins... who tf uses coins?
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> the 3 lectures i visted i was always eating a lot of shit \:D
09:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i do use coins!
09:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> imagine using digitally tracable payment methods -.-
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is one thing I never really changed my habits on despite multiple people asking me to go back to cash
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It is just so damn convenient to use some sort of contactless payment, I cant imagine going back to carrying a bunch of banknotes and coins
09:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i just never went there
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Probably the best way if you want to steer clear. Once you get to that point it's hard to go back 😄
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I don't buy anything I wouldn't want daddy government to know, so it's fine-ish
09:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wrong mindset
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It truly is, but that's the rationalization I'll go for
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but ye tell me about going back \:D Im trying to get rid of my smartphone since years wout success
09:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> To learn more assembly idk
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Getting rid of smartphone is probably the hardest. I use it for just so many things. Imagine going back to SMS and no internet access
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Ryozuki\: reverse zoom to c code to learn assembly thanks
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Im not touching c when i have rust
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> or better no phone at all
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Learath2)
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> rust also fine
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Ryozuki)
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 8086, 68k, z80, 6502 all have interesting assemblies
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Isnt zoom a electron app?
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk
10:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought it wasn't

10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do you know if you can use e.g a gpl license on ur software but disallow usage explocitly from a person or company, such as m$m
10:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 do you know if you can use e.g a gpl license on ur software but disallow usage explocitly from a person or company, such as m$?
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ppl do all sort of things with it tho iirc
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Why
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nah
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Ryozuki)
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I dont want m$ to use any of my code :BASED:
10:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I pity those poor souls
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> idk, don't use copilot then
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> afterall for me this utility is useless af
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ```

10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ```
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I dont use it
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Bro
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> making people just lazy af
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its not about using it
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U got it all wrong
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its about them using copyrighted work to train it
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And it also spits out copyrighted code
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> so you mean that they can use your written by hand code to train
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They do already
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not really. and it doesn't do anything about the copilot thing anyway. anything that it'd do would already be done by the gpl
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hence the action class lawswit they wanna make
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> maybe it is explicitly told by github about that
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> idk
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ???
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Copilot uses code from all github repos
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> that you have to be aware that using copilot helps it to learn
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> well that's different then
10:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> They never asked
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> that sucks lmao
10:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the tod asks that your code can be used for github‘s services. copilot is such a github service
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so they are legally safe? \:D doubt it works that way
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> you can not have ToS that overrule code licenses, can you?
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> court has to decide that
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it's you uploading your code to their platform, they can ask you to license things
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whenever there is a grey area, you can almost always be sure US courts will decide with the corporate overlords
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it gets a little muddy when you upload other people's code, which is usually the case for GPLed software projects
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> So if i mirror the linux kernel on github i actually broke the kernels license and donated to code to ms?! xd
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it has nothing to do with license is what i would argue as github, the suggestions copilot gives do not have any specific license. you as the user are responsible (and good luck finding out where the code came from)
10:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> how can they not have a license if its a snipped out of licensed code? That does not sound valid.
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you can argue the system just learned by reading the code
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> its copying it 1/1 with comments
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> xd
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > how can they not have a license if its a snipped out of licensed code? That does not sound valid.
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no license means you can't use it. not that you can do whatever you want with it
10:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if you manually read someone else‘s code of a project, and then a few months later code something similar based on what you learned, is that against the license?
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thats why i dont read code where i dont agree with the license
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@deen)
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (playing devil‘s advocate, i don‘t like copilot much)
10:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> depends on how much lawyers you and the other person have
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> depends on how many lawyers you and the other person have
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> im sure it can bend you over
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but ye there is no way m$ is getting into any trouble \:D
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I heard some programmers not being allowed to read code as to not break copyright somewhere
10:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> would be cool if there was some sort of open project that you can train on your own code. Which gives you a context based pasted from your old projects \:)
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> thats why restrictive licenses are so ugly
10:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only to be cautious
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can always steal from your own code
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://twitter.com/docsparse/status/1581461734665367554
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> çcheck this out
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but it takes time to find your own code
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> even if it had restrictive licensing
10:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Clean room implementations used to be more common back when corporations had an iron grip on all code
10:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There was a huge mess between the first open bsds and at&t
10:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Does anyone here know a good self hosted http tunnel
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> To receive webhooks locally for example
10:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why not just nginx?
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I mean receive a http request from a public facing server and pass it to my local machine
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Does nginx do that?
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nginx can proxy stuff, sure. proxy_pass is the keyword
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ohh
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U can then pog
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://gist.github.com/gdamjan/4586758
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nice idea mixing it with ssh
10:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems that to make rust link the tests on windows, I need the C++ code compiled with /MD (dynamically linked, release c stdlib). we're currently compiling with /MT (statically linked, release c stdlib) for release and /MTd (statically linked, debug c stdlib)
10:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what is the difference between "release" c stdlib and "debug" c stdlib on windows?

12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> green CI: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5599 !
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen could you try compiling it again? 🙂
13:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2022/no-congress-2022 😦
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do we want to vendor our rust dependencies? into the main repo? into a submodule?
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's a `cargo vendor` which would make it very easy
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> have to board flight first, i‘ll check later today or tomorrow
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sure, thanks 🙂
13:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where do you fly? if you don't mind sharing
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> back home from palermo to karlsruhe
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ddnet airlines
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ddnet airline
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> any RegEx pros? How do i make sure 2 numbers are equal, here is my expression: `\d{1,32}on\d{1,32}`, i want to make sure both numbers are equal, im new to regex and was confused by number of tokens, didn't find something useful for my case
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don‘t think you can, would need some extension so probably depends on the regex engine
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just collect them both as groups and compare them later in your regular code
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> k, thanks
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Backreferences are the keyword you are looking for, if you want to check if your regex implementation has them
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but not a regex in the strict compsci sense then anymore
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd need to be a pushdown automata atleast, right?
13:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> my uni classes are too long ago
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> based on google seems so
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> did you try coffee 😄 ?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not the best idea on an empty stomach
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> coffee + croissant then
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, I guess. Q croissant alone maketh not breakfast
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `(\d{1,32})on\1` for a (not quite) regex engine supporting backreferences
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think(tm) this sort of regex engine is usually vulnerable to stuff like catastrophic backtracking. So I'd really suggest what deen suggested
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it is, but usually not on all regexes ^^
14:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the regex engine shipped with python is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking, for example
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> working perfectly, thanks ^^
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> ```cl_auto_demo_on_connect    Only start a new demo when connect while automatically record demos```
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Vy0x2> Does somebody have a better explanation for this command?
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> is there a way to send motd silently, so it wont pop up to user?
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What use would it have?
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> well, i thought to use it as updating server info
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you can just send serverinfo and the client should update it properly. What does motd have to do with that?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> im about custom server info, just any changing info, its not that necessary to use broadcast or chat for displaying it, so i thought of motd
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mh, idk if sending a motd message makes it pop up
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> yep, definitely
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, then I don't think there is a way. But I'll take a quick look
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> unfortunately😄
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> idk what was changed but i get only half fps recently in ddrace
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i had like 4000fps normal and now 2000, and when i open scoreboard it even decreases to 500

17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> You can send motd at any interval for each user ,individually, or silent for someone, or for each his own interval. 
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> Send me a pm and I'll explain
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <𝙺𝚞𝚛𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚘> You can send motd at any interval for each user ,individually, or silent for someone, or for each his own interval without erasing it from serverinfo motd.

18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> can't wait to have that gpu catch on fire
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> have u tried click restart
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> restart what?
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> windows
19:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Izanagi> i played the game before i shut down my pc and also after i started my pc so i'd assume a pc restart doesnt change anything
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no press restart
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> shutdown -> start is not = restart in windows
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> else try what usually helps
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> try new config
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> clean computer
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> down/up-grade drivers
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> try older ddnet to confirm
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> close all programs except ddnet
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> hmm, ipv6 and ipv4 servers appear twice
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which version? which server name?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> LAN?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> current trashmap with behemoth2 map
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 0.6 protocol failed to register via IPv6 for some reason
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> need logs
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro ^
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <J$ON> Python pros pm me
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> seems to work on linux and windows, haven't tried mac
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> cool 🙂
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> is it possible for you to try in the next couple of days as well? the normal build should work, I tried it on some friend's notebook, but I haven't tried the release script
23:55 <+deen> ok
