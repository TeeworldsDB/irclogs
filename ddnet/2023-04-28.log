09:59 <+ChillerDragon> Yo print driven debug developers!
10:00 <+ChillerDragon> you prefer dbg_msgs everywhere over actual debugger tooling?
10:00 <+ChillerDragon> but you ended up putting 100 dbg msgs in your tick method so the log is spammed with unchanged values?
10:00 <+ChillerDragon> you wrote 100 lines to print just to figure out you forgot to recompile?
10:00 <+ChillerDragon> then buy the chiler debug macro now
10:00 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1682668758.png
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> just say `DBG_II(yourvar1, yourvar2)` and it will generate a nice print message which only prints if the variables updated
10:01 <+ChillerDragon> pre order at shop.zillyhuhn.com now

10:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If u want debug messages everywhere use a verbose flag
10:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Generally I'd say it depends. Sometimes log driven debugging is defs easier
10:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just gotta be careful to not to spam so much that u can't find the real bugs anymore xd
10:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If bug is easy to reproduce, debugger is probably easier
11:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2:
11:03 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> I officially did nothing today
11:04 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> vocation starts tomorrow tho
11:04 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> vacation starts tomorrow tho
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> scrumplex: when build polytw?
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> i need to organize all my fake identities and bot clients and keep it seperate
11:13 <+ChillerDragon> :justatest:
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> i mean during development i just yeet in a dbg to verify the variable content is what i expected @Jupstar ✪
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> if thats in a loop it spamms out the same value 100 times and log is full
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> my macro removes the effort of writing the format string and it ensures repeated values are not printed
11:16 <+ChillerDragon> also hi heinrich pls no ban this was a joke .-.
11:16 <+ChillerDragon> fstd: did you get hacked?
11:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Chillerdragores omg amazing
11:31 <+ChillerDragon> anyone know a good hack to release mouse in ddnet client?
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> i currently use opening console but that then blocks the view
11:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> In kde i have one. But no idea for gnome
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> xd
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> wot kde pro?
11:32 <+ChillerDragon> how in kde
11:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Can u search logs?
11:33 <+ChillerDragon> yes
11:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what i usually do is pressing meta key + d, which is a KDE script to minimize all windows and frees the mouse
11:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> From there
11:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U have to activate it in kde tho
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/irclogs/blob/2754e3032ca7ab6f7754ba715501ae2a85f0ed67/ddnet/2023-02-25.log#L83
11:34 <+bridge> <uwu> Chat, console, esc, spec, dummy switch
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> caht doesnt work
11:34 <+ChillerDragon> spec doesnt work either
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> console blocks view
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> dummy switch?
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> i dont mean stuck inputs
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> but release mode so i can get out of da window
11:35 <+ChillerDragon> wait jopsti but u minimize
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> thats not an option for me i use the client as camera
11:36 <+bridge> <uwu> Isnt that like the same, you can change windows without loosing controls state
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> but i can not get my mouse out of the window
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> oh yea and i do not want to tab out :D
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> just mouse ou
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> guess ill have to rls the mouse from sdl xd
11:38 <+bridge> <uwu> Oh you mean that release mode, ok, now i got it
11:38 <+ChillerDragon> yes
11:39 <+bridge> <uwu> Well, console and esc works, doesn't know any other ways
11:39 <+ChillerDragon> esc doesnt work for me
11:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> It's stupid that no os does this anyway
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> does what
11:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> We should listen for debugger signal
11:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> And release mouse
11:41 <+ChillerDragon> ?
11:41 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> !
11:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Did I bait u to use matrix BCS u thought I was answering something?
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> nope
11:43 <+ChillerDragon> i just ask u
11:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Too bad XD
11:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Well I don't understand ur problem maybe. My brain is not active today
11:47 <+ChillerDragon> dw i fix it with code like real haxor
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> https://tube.zillyhuhn.com/video.php?t=superior_mouse_mode.mp4&u=chiller
11:52 <+ChillerDragon> i want this and i have it now so all good :)
11:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I don't understand what's different than normal client but gg
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> you can not leave the window with your mouse in the normal client
11:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Switching between two instances I'd use alt tab
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> yes
11:55 <+ChillerDragon> but i dont wanna switch xd
11:56 <+ChillerDragon> i wanna use it like a normal window that i can click out of and move around and click in etc
11:56 <+ChillerDragon> im a mouse person xd
11:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> I see
11:56 <+ChillerDragon> idk how to keyboard shortcut
11:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah obv not working. F1 u can release mouse
11:56 <+ChillerDragon> but then i cant see shit
11:57 <+ChillerDragon> i want 10 clients on my 7 monitors and click around to stalk 
11:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Yeah yeah
11:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Just do ur way
11:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Easier
11:57 <+ChillerDragon> i want starting the client to feel like starting a browser you know?

12:02 <+bridge> <Joel.> 🙂
12:03 <+bridge> <Joel.> why you say every time hooman and not human
12:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Homunculus
12:05 <+bridge> <Joel.> oki
12:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i developed chiller
12:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> with rust
12:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and some sprinkle of bash
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> xd
12:06 <+ChillerDragon> senpaii ryo UwU
12:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> sensei*
12:07 <+bridge> <Joel.> It is a very good AI that you developed
12:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> thanks
12:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its cuz i made it in rust
12:08 <+bridge> <Joel.> sry don't really know how rust works
12:08 <+ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPk-fyP9MFM
12:08 <+bridge> <Joel.> XD
12:09 <+bridge> <Joel.> I think that is the rong Rust Chillerdragon
12:11 <+bridge> <Joel.> Does the Ai continue to develop himself?
12:12 <+ChillerDragon> when rename #deveoper to #off-topic2 ?2~
12:13 <+bridge> <Learath2> I never knew Chiller was AI, wtf
12:13 <+bridge> <Learath2> Good job Ryo
12:13 <+bridge> <Joel.> XD
12:15 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Who guarantees me that ChillerDragonballTroll isn't the genius and ryo is in fact an ai that always advertised rust?
12:16 <+bridge> <Joel.> Chillerdragon writes to fast to be human and sometimes the answers are...weird or not right

12:54 <+ChillerDragon> i added a gnome keybinding for the hotkey
12:54 <+ChillerDragon> then it calls miam screenshot tol
12:54 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> too adavanced for me
12:54 <+ChillerDragon> and uses scp to upload in my web dir
12:54 <+ChillerDragon> maim
12:54 <+ChillerDragon> wtf this tools name is literaly a typo
12:54 <+bridge> <TsFreddie> My colleague has a pretty cool screenshot too (on windows) in which he can crop a screenshot and pin it on the top

14:31 <+bridge> <Joel.> but why does Chillerdragon didn't answer?
14:32 <+bridge> <Voxel> because he has a life
14:32 <+bridge> <Voxel> i dunno
14:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hey @marmare_314, I'd like to talk to you about https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6440, I'd like to see something like that merged
14:37 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (if you do answer, ping or DM me so I don't miss it)
14:38 <+bridge> <Voxel> #6440
14:38 <+bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6440
14:38 <+bridge> <Voxel> oh this
14:45 <+ChillerDragon> rage closed
15:00 <+bridge> <Voxel> it sux
15:00 <+bridge> <Voxel> i like how you can drag the envelope box size tho
15:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what sucks? 🙂
15:06 <+bridge> <Voxel> oddly intimidating
15:06 <+bridge> <Voxel> i think ravie said it perfectly here
15:06 <+bridge> <Voxel> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6440#issuecomment-1493383109
15:08 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I see someone having a plan on how to improve the editor
15:08 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'd like to encourage that
15:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> on the particulars of this PR: I think this makes browsing the envelopes much quicker (+/- button seems bad). making the envelope editor resizable seems entirely obvious
15:15 <+bridge> <Ravie> resizing is the one good thing about it, the browser part is just really strange and not good
15:17 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I guess we can agree that the current method isn't good?
15:18 <+bridge> <Ravie> I prefer the current +- over moving them away to some random other place
15:18 <+bridge> <Ravie> ideally there would be something like a dropdown with a scroll bar where the +- is
15:18 <+bridge> <Ravie> but there's also no point in adding that to the current envelope editor imo
15:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it seems relatively clear to me that +/- for selecting something from a list is really bad UI
15:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> if we can't agree on that, I guess we can't agree on how to design the editor ^^
15:19 <+bridge> <Ravie> it's not great but it's better than having the list in some totally unrelated other part of the ui
15:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > it's not great
15:19 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> glad we agree
15:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure where to best put it
15:20 <+bridge> <Ravie> ^
15:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds good
15:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (but that's not what I got from the comments in the PR, that's why I wanted to communicate with marmare314 again)
15:22 <+bridge> <Ravie> there are other parts of the editor that need work much more than envelopes tho
15:22 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's okay. it's nice that we get someone who wants to improve something
15:23 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm happy. and if we're a good fit, maybe we get another contributor that might eventually also tackle the other problems you see in the editor
15:23 <+bridge> <Ravie> change doesn't necessarily mean improve
15:23 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> please explain how this relates to the situation or the PR
15:24 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> causation does not imply correlation
15:24 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (yes, this way around)
15:24 <+bridge> <Ravie> I wrote in the pr why I think the change is not an improvement
15:25 <+bridge> <Ravie> I think different ways to do it that *would* be an improvement are not really on topic for the pr
15:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think we agreed that changing +/- to some dropdown might be an improvement? did you say that it's not an improvement because of something else as well?
15:27 <+bridge> <Ravie> it would be an improvement, but that's not what the pr does
15:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> correct
15:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> in communication, I think it'd be better to give constructive proposals how the PR can be improved rather than rejecting it entirely
15:28 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think this will lead to more devs in the long term
15:29 <+bridge> <Ravie> true but I think proposing to do it completely differently means the pr gets rejected anyway
15:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not necessarily, the PR can me adapted
15:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> PRs can be changed before they get accepted/rejected
15:30 <+bridge> <louis> yeah dropdown list is best imo
15:30 <+bridge> <marmare_314> I just want to point out that it was a draft pr
15:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (I think marmare_314 wanted to imply that this wasn't supposed to be the final state of the PR)
15:37 <+bridge> <marmare_314> I agree with this. Its a bit frustrating to have your ideas get stomped into the ground completely
15:37 <+bridge> <marmare_314> I get that this is quite a big project with many different opinions on design, but still its not nice to get that kind of feedback
15:38 <+bridge> <marmare_314> Before anything with draggable buttons can be done https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6529 needs to be fixed btw
15:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ah
15:42 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Do you want to investigate this further and find a fix or workaround? I couldn't reproduce the issue yet. Would be nice if this was fixed before the next release in ~2 weeks
15:44 <+bridge> <Learath2> Yeah, also the reason I haven't touched the code in a while. People are extremely nasty about changes to the nostalgic game
15:45 <+bridge> <Pipou> Imagine having 60 envelopes with that new system
15:46 <+bridge> <Pipou> That would be painful
15:46 <+bridge> <Pipou> The left side is already messy enough
15:46 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Why? It would show a popup menu with a maximum height of 10-15 entries and then scroll for the rest
15:46 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> please read the chat
15:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it was about constructive criticism instead of dismissing the ideas outright
15:50 <+bridge> <Pipou> I was refering to that github page
15:50 <+bridge> <Ravie> first you have to scroll down all the layers to get to it, either that or compromise precious space for layers
15:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u sure its that or just lazy/life
15:50 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what do you think about https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6493 ? it's true that this adds quite some additional handling in the normal code paths. how would we do this?
15:51 <+bridge> <marmare_314> What I outlined in the issue is pretty much all I have on this, I can implement that and hope that it works, but I cant check
15:51 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the problem was that we just had a chat about how this is not-so-constructive feedback. you were apparently unaware of that discussion, sorry
15:51 <+bridge> <Robyt3> The envelope list would only be shown when the envelope editor is open, or when a different button is pressed
15:51 <+bridge> <Ravie> showing/hiding some other menu along with envelope editor is messy too
15:51 <+bridge> <Learath2> I mean I do get an hour or so free sometimes, but I just do something else instead because if I go for the editor rewrite I've been thinking of I know it'll be so much friction
15:52 <+bridge> <Ravie> it should just stay inside the envelope editor
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 this morning i started implementing a postgresql backend for the database and after 2 hours i stopped cuz i felt lazy
15:52 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> deen would be delighted 😄
15:52 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> :DeadCat:
15:52 <+bridge> <Pipou> When did I dismiss it ? It isn't convenient as it is proposed
15:53 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye ill probs continue, just need to recover xD
15:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the problem is that you say "this idea is bad", and don't try to instead improve the idea
15:53 <+bridge> <Ravie> saying exactly what about the idea is bad is just as good as saying how to do it better
15:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no
15:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you saw marmare_314's message above
15:54 <+bridge> <Pipou> I didn't say it's bad, l said it would be painful, not very efficient and practical
15:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> they explicitly said that the communication in the PR was not good
15:54 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the problem is that you say "this idea is painful, not very efficient and practical", and don't try to instead improve the idea
15:55 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ("bad" was supposed to be a placeholder)
15:55 <+bridge> <Pipou> Yes because I would rather keep it as it is than change it
15:56 <+bridge> <Pipou> I dont have a better system to suggest that the current one
15:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you do not think that the current method of selecting envelopes is quite obviously suboptimal?
15:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> then say something along those lines
15:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> e.g. "I don't think this improves anything, but I can't think of a better method either, currently"
15:57 <+bridge> <Pipou> It is, unfortunately but I don't know enough about UI to give the perfect solution
15:57 <+bridge> <Pipou> I know ravie already had great ideas in the past when he showed me some prototype of his
15:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> cool, then let's not discourage new contributors because they might in the end implement something like that
15:58 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> cool, then let's not discourage new contributors because they might, in the end, implement something like that
15:59 <+bridge> <louis> what abt press editor button opens up a popup window
15:59 <+bridge> <louis> wasnt someone working on popup windows before
16:00 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> hi
16:00 <+bridge> <Pipou> I can't wait then 😄
16:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well popup windows already exist
16:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> altho they are not rly "modular"
16:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> they are like hardcoded and meh
16:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> (popup windows being like the warning ppl used to get for wrong skins)
16:02 <+bridge> <Robyt3> We also have the small popups which are used everywhere in the editor already
16:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe a way to make floating windows
16:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and let mappers organize the editor to their liking
16:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> like in egui
16:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://www.egui.rs/#demo
16:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ye i made those hehe
16:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but they are not windows like he means i think
16:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> does not respect my hidpi monitor
16:03 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what does that mean
16:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the text is blurry, probably using 4 pixels to render one pixel
16:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm well idk, maybe something about canvas rendering in web
16:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sorry, was my fault
16:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it works
16:05 <+bridge> <Pipou> I also believe people should consult Ravie when they plan on adding or editing the editor
16:05 <+bridge> <Pipou> So we don't end up adding feature that are broken or pointless
16:05 <+bridge> <Pipou> So we don't end up adding features that are broken or pointless
16:06 <+bridge> <Pipou> (example : the custom zoom feature)
16:06 <+bridge> <Pipou> I also believe people should consult Ravie when they plan on adding features or editing the editor
16:07 <+bridge> <Pipou> I also believe people should consult Ravie when they plan on adding features to the editor or when they plan on updating the existing ones
16:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> generally, the way to get feedback is via github; people suggest changes and we review them
16:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I don't know about the custom zoom feature, can you explain what happened there?
16:10 <+bridge> <Pipou> In short, the custom zoom broke some maps and it's awkward in general
16:11 <+bridge> <Pipou> It even makes it more difficult to understand for the average designer
16:11 <+bridge> <Rating> Hey guys, I'm trying to work on merging from vanilla too DDNET but this is my first time working on games / server ( I got a degree in dev overall ).
16:11 <+bridge> <Rating> If anyone could few minutes to explain to me how to start / understand overall code. Thank you 😄

16:11 <+bridge> <Pipou> Ravie could tell you more about it, he fought against it already
16:12 <+bridge> <Pipou> All I know is that one of my maps (unreleased) is broken since then
16:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I see

16:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> (:justatest: )
16:18 <+bridge> <Voxel> i kinda know that feel
16:18 <+bridge> <Voxel> i made the infamous sitting PR
16:18 <+bridge> <Rating> I hope it'll be a good experience not stuck in a single ; for days
16:18 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> if u know c++, its a matter of time and looking at code
16:19 <+bridge> <Rating> I used C C# C++ but been a while
16:19 <+bridge> <Rating> last ones I used are flatter / ionic mostly mobile
16:19 <+bridge> <Skeith> Sitting is great
16:19 <+bridge> <Voxel> yeah but everyone else hates it
16:19 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but yeah the truth is its hard to get into it, not many resources
16:20 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Robyt3 the IME change?
16:22 <+bridge> <Skeith> I believe a very vocal minority dislikes it, everyone I know prefers it
16:23 <+bridge> <Voxel> oka
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ quizz time! which web designers are happy to find bugs?
16:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> those who seek for themselves
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> spiders
16:33 <+ChillerDragon> :trollface:
16:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice one
16:34 <+bridge> <gerdoe> L
16:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u didnt even get mine
16:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs u need 300IQ
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> just casual front end insult
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> no iq needed
16:34 <+bridge> <gerdoe> nice feature but list should be "hide-able" idk
16:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xD
16:35 <+bridge> <gerdoe> yeah i still hate it xd
16:37 <+bridge> <gerdoe> btw seems Patiga would make same animations tees have ingame so he will make literally animkey editor for tw in rust
16:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> when i made telegun some ppl were angry too xd
16:38 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> also when i made the /spec ghost tee
16:38 <+bridge> <Voxel> i wanna make procedrial animations for tees, sorta like how rain world does it
16:38 <+bridge> <Voxel> where the animation looks more fluid
16:38 <+bridge> <Voxel> 
16:38 <+bridge> <Voxel> only in like another client though, or just a demo renderer
16:40 <+bridge> <Skeith> The outline? Why would anyone complain about that :thonk:
16:41 <+bridge> <gerdoe> lol? no one was afair
16:42 <+bridge> <Skeith> Grrr! The game's better!
16:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> some ppl yes
16:43 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i think konsti
16:43 <+bridge> <Skeith> ofc
16:43 <+bridge> <gerdoe> afkoksti
16:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> its like full rework of skin system isn't it
16:46 <+bridge> <gerdoe> also about editor "problem"
16:46 <+bridge> <gerdoe> isn't it a time to separate modules?
16:46 <+bridge> <gerdoe> like making editor standalone
16:47 <+bridge> <gerdoe> and client
16:47 <+bridge> <gerdoe> and server
16:47 <+bridge> <gerdoe> and engine
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> koksti
16:47 <+bridge> <gerdoe> but anyway source isn't prepared enough xd
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> !ping

16:50 <+ChillerDragon> ok ill add
16:51 <+bridge> <gerdoe> !pig
16:51 <+bridge> <Voxel> wouldnt that be too complicated
16:51 <+ChillerDragon> bot down for maintenance
16:51 <+bridge> <Voxel> n..no?
16:51 <+bridge> <Patiga> could you please elaborate on that in this issue https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6196 ?
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> !bing
16:52 < chillerbot> bong
16:52 <+bridge> <gerdoe> the same thing actually but with possibility of making custom client/server/editor without need of merging whole stuff
16:52 <+ChillerDragon> xd
16:52 <+bridge> <Ravie> mine's not in rust so I guess it's not cool :feelsbadman:
16:52 <+bridge> <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1101521430950203483/default.mp4
16:53 <+ChillerDragon> downloading default.mp4 from discord cdn ..
16:53 <+bridge> <gerdoe> like changes appeared originally in ddnet-server and ddnet-engine -> you are making custom editor but there's no need to merge ddnet-server stuff
16:53 <+bridge> <Patiga> I actually already finished the animation rendering, I wouldn't call it an editor tho ^^
16:53 <+bridge> <gerdoe> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/295908390956433410/1051886342155542628/steam1_rapid_uncropped.gif
16:53 <+bridge> <Voxel> i think its cool! <3
16:53 <+bridge> <Pipou> Hey Patiga, I'll try to, or I'll just send the map later
16:53 <+bridge> <gerdoe> waiting for sources xd
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> new github ui trash now noting holding me there
16:54 <+ChillerDragon> ryo u got some free git instances running i can use to upload 100gb of repos? ima ditch ms
16:55 <+bridge> <Patiga> I'm not sure what you are expecting, so please relax your expectations. its literally just that the keyframes are stored in constants and I have a function for sampling
16:55 <+bridge> <gerdoe> :feelsbadman:
16:55 <+bridge> <gerdoe> anyway good job xd
16:56 <+bridge> <Patiga> well I'm just trying to reimplement the rendering, no fancy editor stuff :d
16:57 <+bridge> <Patiga> tadaa, very amazing code https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twgpu/-/blob/7a3df5d7e1c0904d176851ade4237d83a7b64e57/twgpu/src/tee/animation.rs#L57
16:57 <+bridge> <Patiga> :bluekitty:  ignore the comment about binary search
16:58 <+bridge> <Voxel> what even is gitlab
16:58 <+bridge> <Voxel> isnt that just paid github
16:58 <+bridge> <Voxel> or is it not
16:58 <+bridge> <Patiga> no ^^
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> its actually more free in a sense
16:58 <+bridge> <Voxel> weird
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> but yea they have similar pricing models like github
16:59 <+bridge> <Patiga> but if you want you can host your own gitlab instance, since its open source, or at least mostly(?)
17:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > (mathematics, computing) To interpolate linearly.
17:00 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> interesting
17:01 <+bridge> <Patiga> > sample
17:01 <+bridge> <Patiga> or which word is it?
17:01 <+bridge> <Ravie> @Patiga so you're gonna implement tw physics and have something like a replay bot but for rendering
17:01 <+bridge> <Ravie> @Patiga so you're gonna implement tw physics and have something like a replay bot but for rendering?
17:01 <+ChillerDragon> sus
17:02 <+bridge> <Patiga> I'm writing a plain renderer, that hopefully can be used for demos as well as a client etc.
17:02 <+bridge> <Patiga> Zwelf is writing the physics in Rust, which I'll also need at some point for rendering
17:03 <+bridge> <gerdoe> epic duo
17:03 <+bridge> <Patiga> and ofc heinrich5991 has tons of other stuff already, which is awesome
17:04 <+ChillerDragon> epic trio
17:04 <+bridge> <Ravie> I hard coded some values so that the tee's speed matches feet movement :justatest:
17:04 <+bridge> <Patiga> rn for example I use the demo crate from libtw2 which depends on a lot of other teeworlds algorithms also implemented in libtw2
17:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> lerp
17:06 <+bridge> <Voxel> the strength of that L is unmatched

18:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if u now get above 70° u did smth wrong
18:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
18:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> 6 pipes
18:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> such a monster of a cooler
18:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> on each side
18:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://www.bequiet.com/admin/ImageServer.php?ID=2a148a15642@be-quiet.net&omitPreview=true&.jpg
18:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but be quiet still looks a bit bigger xD
18:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> hopiun
18:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i should switch to water cooling some day
18:51 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> just for the flex
19:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> ill get over 70
19:34 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what  i read is that this cpu rly tries to hit those temps, squeezing more perf
19:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so better cooling just results in more perf
19:35 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but idk
19:36 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> and the 5800x is just stupid hot
19:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> how do u read the temps?
19:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> sensors
19:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> also its now getting summer temps here
19:41 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i also think my case is simply not that good at airflow xd
19:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh yeah but seems u are right, they are designed to try to use as much as possible
19:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ALL IN FOR PERFORMANCE, that's the spirit
19:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> kek
19:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but i also read intel is hotter these days
19:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:46 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> man i havent hada intel cpu in decades
19:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i see intel the whole day
19:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fat yellow circle in the sky
19:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i dont even know the intel cpu names
19:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> wat
19:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://tenor.com/view/sunshine-sunday-blessings-gif-24906345
19:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its normal that intel runs 15 million °C
19:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> using 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000Wh
19:47 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
19:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its funny that intel is the one that is blamed xD
19:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> while nvidia planned to use 600Watt xD
19:48 <+bridge> <Chairn> they show up normally for me
19:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks so far, gaming stays about 60C, compiling can reach 80
19:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> the 3080 is always like 45-60
19:50 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> insane cooling
19:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> anyone seen the new beta client for steam?
19:51 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1101566481306759248/image.png
19:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hot
19:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i liked the lighter one
19:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> c
19:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :c
19:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it feels a bit faster
19:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice
19:58 <+bridge> <Chairn> damn, i feel forgotten
19:58 <+bridge> <Chairn> [], + is extend i believe
20:00 <+bridge> <Chairn> good thing that on ~600 messages, most were chillerbot spam
20:02 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> !rust

20:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
20:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ChillerDragon: fix !jup
20:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> !c should say, rewrite it in rust
20:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> !cpp too
20:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ez
20:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> !windows = use linux
20:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> !cpp_is_awesome should autoreply in your name
20:04 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:05 <+bridge> <Chairn> should say Segmentation fault
20:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> !python should wait 10 seconds before answering
20:05 < chillerbot> 4
20:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks here is a cool bot idea, i seen in other projects, make a channel where the user uploads a crashlog, ideally the crashlog contains the commit information inside, so the bot auto resolves the symbols and shows us the stacktrace
20:06 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> i seen this on discords
20:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, we should simply use a custom drmingw and inject the commit there
20:06 <+bridge> <Chairn> we'll soon need a #bridge channel to not spam this channel
20:07 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1101570461441200229/image.png
20:07 <+bridge> <Chairn> We can also compile with `-DCOMMIT_HASH=1234 -frecord-gcc-switches` and retrieve the hash from the binary
20:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> u tell me how to resolve this in detail and i can host a bot
20:09 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Or just compile release with debug information so we don't need to resolve any symbols
20:09 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that would be too easy
20:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
20:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lets take the overcomplicated way
20:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> we dont do easy engineering here
20:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> but well the end user can be stupid and dont know how to send stacktraces
20:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> well if its a file yes
20:10 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:11 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but yeah, actually we should just build with debug symbols
20:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @deen wanna try out for the next RC? ^
20:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> for windows
20:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 40mb more to download not nice, but also not too muhc compared to other games
20:12 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> its for rc anyway
20:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> as a start ^^
20:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> later maybe for release too
20:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but for RC should be cool already
20:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks does windows support split debug info?
20:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> gcc supports it
20:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe we can add the debug info on steam as a dlc
20:13 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> xd
20:23 <+bridge> <Chairn> how about light debug symbols, with -g1 ?
20:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if drmingw doesnt struggle with it
20:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but why not full?
20:23 <+bridge> <Chairn> g1 allows stacktrace with no other info
20:24 <+bridge> <Chairn> so way lighter than g2 that gives all variables
20:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Robyt3 does drmingw source code preview even work without the source being available?
20:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well drmingw can literally show the source code
20:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which is kinda cool
20:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but probs only with source downloaded
20:25 <+bridge> <Chairn> yeah, but then it embeds the source code
20:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we would survive it xd
20:25 <+bridge> <Chairn> that's already 10MB
20:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> sounds like nothing
20:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> our chinese font wastes like 15MB XD
20:28 <+bridge> <Robyt3> I think it can only resolve the line numbers if the source code is not available, e.g. I get this crash log with nightly with symbols, when loading a random invalid map:
20:28 <+bridge> <Robyt3> ```
20:28 <+bridge> <Robyt3> DDNet.exe caused an Access Violation at location 00007FF669148DD7 in module DDNet.exe Reading from location 0000000000000059.

20:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mhh thats sad
20:29 <+bridge> <Learath2> I think wasting 40MB just isn't enough. We should do more. Let's zero pad everything with a couple extra kb
20:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bro lets be fair, this isnt wasted
20:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its actually useful
20:30 <+bridge> <Learath2> Oooh, lets also link the entire git history
20:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also 40mb xDDD
20:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's nothing
20:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where are u all living
20:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in 1996?
20:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Drive    Price    Price Per GB
20:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Crucial P3 Plus    $54.99    $0.05
20:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 5 cents
20:33 <+bridge> <Learath2> Just because you have it doesn't mean you have to use it
20:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if its useful?
20:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its also not loaded into ram if not used
20:34 <+bridge> <Learath2> How is every user having the entire symbol table useful? What for even? It's literally a cop out so we don't have to think as hard
20:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> better would be if it downloads it as soon as the crash occurs
20:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or a bot as ryo suggested, but both would require code change in drmingw
20:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> which is not controlled by us
20:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's the motivation behind this
20:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but
20:36 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> actually i have an idea
20:37 <+bridge> <Learath2> Does drmingw have nowhere you can hook to print a commit hash?
20:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah it has
20:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the name of thefile
20:37 <+bridge> <Robyt3> Except the filename, no, and the author rejected such an idea
20:37 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we do have a short git hash in the client?
20:38 <+bridge> <Learath2> That does sound annoying. How about using another solution like crashpad?
20:38 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think the file name is good enough
20:40 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Why read crash logs? Just rewrite in rust to fix crashes
20:40 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> !rust
20:40 < chillerbot> @Ryozuki
20:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> what license drmingw has?
20:42 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> free software has no limits such as "author rejected such idea"
20:42 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
20:44 <+bridge> <Robyt3> We can fork it again and compile our own version, but then we'd have to maintain the fork instead of just using the official release versions
20:54 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> do like chiller, diff-aware changes
20:55 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> so we have easy merging xd
20:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we actually did compile our own version
20:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> before
20:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @murpi is the ddnet bot hosted on a linux server?
20:58 <+bridge> <murpi> yes
20:59 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> heresy otherwise
20:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i wonder if its even safe to use external programs outside of python
20:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
20:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> e.g. is addr2line free of vulnerables.. i guess nobody cares in such an app xD

21:01 <+bridge> <Ryozuki> truly C
21:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, maybe we can sandbox it?
21:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Learath2 what cpu ring magic do i need
