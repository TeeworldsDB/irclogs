01:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> Do you guys knows of any shell that gives enhanced command history such as working directory, duration of the command, return value, etc. ?
01:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the most "enhanced" shell ive seen is fish but it's not POSIX compliant
01:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> POSIX compliance is probably not a problem, but not being able to copy-paste arbitrary bash snippets can be
01:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that's more what i meant
01:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> something specific out of posix lol
01:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sh would probably have the same problem
01:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and sh is posix-compliant)
01:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i hate the new logo
01:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> set a profile picture :P
09:13 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> I can also recommend sticking to a shell like bash or zsh. But zsh has plenty of plugins so you might be able to use those @lynn there is this one for example https://github.com/zthxxx/zsh-history-enquirer it looks a bit less fancy than what you are looking for but maybe if you are motivated enough you can build it your self :)
09:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use this, which runs on top of bash, fish, zsh https://starship.rs/ and made in rust ofc
09:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i really like zsh
09:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starship/starship/master/media/demo.gif
09:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
09:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> idk i like fish and zsh equally
09:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it doesnt matter to me
09:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but fish is cooler probably B)
13:07 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> vanilla bash masterrace
16:09 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon https://cdn.noby.world/1621001368.png no u
16:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I want something fancy I use fish, It's much better than zsh imo. zsh is like the visual studio of the shell world ðŸ˜›
16:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but almost all of my machines have just bash on them, because it justworks(tm)
16:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `fn main() { break rust; }`
16:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
16:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> is there a rust "interpreter" a la tcc?
16:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> How is tcc an "interpreter"? It's just a fast compiler with few optimizations
17:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is tcc
17:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://bellard.org/tcc/
17:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well it has a cute `-run` flag which still obv compiles it (hence the quotes)
17:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So you can have `#!/bin/tcc -run` ðŸ™‚
17:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I once tried to make the nim interpreter run with libtcc
17:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> `#!/usr/bin/env run-cargo-script` https://github.com/DanielKeep/cargo-script
17:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Oh well, no new commits, maybe this instead: https://github.com/igor-petruk/scriptisto
17:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Or some hacky way to make your program both a valid rust program and a shell script: https://blog.firedrake.org/archive/2020/11/A_Shebang_For_Rust.html ðŸ˜„
17:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What's missing is to remember the return code and return it from exit
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i love these blogs using pure html tables and tags that nobody uses but exist
19:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they also work rly well with extensions that turn pages dark
20:27 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i hate sites in general with too many custom components
20:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i value using natural DOM stuff to its limits first
20:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh @Learath2 i took your advice :P
20:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://teehou.se/
20:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> let's encrypt cert and nginx
20:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and i DIDNT USE the plugin this time, i actually learned how to set up the nginx directives myself this time, like a good girl
20:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yaaay
20:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's a good time investment
20:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yea, it was weird figuring out that for a long time i kept writing to modules-available until i realized, no, sites-available you idiot
20:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also wtf is with ubuntu over SSH? tab does nothing, arrows do nothing, and this is just a nitpick but the default prompt doesnt even have relpath xD
20:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe this is just a windows terminal issue?
20:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe you use the wrong shell, i.e. sh instead of bash?
20:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> wait maybe
20:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is default sh??
20:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk, but your symptoms sound like it
20:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is it bashrc or rcprofile for selecting a shell
20:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> xD
20:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
20:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> waitttt
20:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> its usermod isnt it
20:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> shell is selected using chsh -s /path/to/shell <username>
20:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh that's new
20:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i did it in the past with something else i think
20:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `cat /etc/passwd | grep <username>`
20:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to see your currently configured shell (last column)
20:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ah
20:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> god maybe i manually edited that with root LOLO
20:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> god maybe i manually edited that with root LOL
20:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> careful not to make that unparsable
20:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk what happens to your system then ^^
20:35 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> probably not being able to log in ever again lol
20:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i need to stop running scp from powershell and just get ftp working
20:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> isnt it installed by default on ubuntu
20:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's your use case for scp?
20:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there's WinSCP which is a graphical tool for scp
20:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well, random html stuff i want to edit locally and upload later
20:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for ftp*
20:36 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> or .map files for servers
20:37 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think i downloaded that
20:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I use msys scp on my main windows computer. On anything else if it needs it it's getting winscp
20:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> o lol that worked just fine
20:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sftp even
20:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sftp doesn't have anything to do with ftp IIRC
20:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's a file transfer protocol over ssh
20:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (ftps is ftp with TLS)
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i just didnt know i didnt have to set it up
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i still miss arch though, god dammit NFO
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you don't mind fiddling, you can probably install arch there, too
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Eh arch on a server isn't an excellent idea anyway
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i mean i could using the virtual disk but too much effort
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You want stable not bleeding edge on a server
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> and i already set it up
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i use 18.04 lts on both servers usa and ger
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cus 20 is wack
20:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You just need a recovery environment and you can get arch on there using pacstrap. I do the same for devuan with debootstrap
20:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's fine, plus i should probably be proficient with different types of distros
20:47 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> in case i ever encounter them (assuming i would ever get a devops job :P)
22:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <Deeper> vote_yes removed?
22:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Try without the _
22:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what's suggested if you just type `vote`
22:34 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> can't reproduce vote_yes being suggested
23:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <jao> vote_yes never existed
