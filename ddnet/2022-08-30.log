00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I've seen someone in KoG discord mentioning coloured names for servers, could be cool tho
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Probably cuz I made rainbow name
09:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Probably very distracting. I like the current, clean look of the server browsers, where only important things are colored, such as gametypes or ping
10:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> It's 2022 not 2002
10:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Should every entry on google should have the possibility to color their entry in any color they want just because its 2022?
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> 2022, time to have lgbtq vegan furry gender flags on your screen in every fucking app
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> advertized links become rainbow :greenthing:
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :justatest:
10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> fr tho colored names might take attention away from gameplay, which is not good in this game
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> They are talking about server names
10:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Anime.pdf> Oh, server names. Server list will be a complete mess, like in trackmania nations
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh i misread.
10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Me too

10:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> at first
10:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I did rainbow playername tho
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Latest thing I coded
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i saw, which is why i got confused xd
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Same xd
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its very complex due to the way the client uses the team information :(
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but i think i made quite a good algorithm for it now
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and cuz the way its sent
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Its more than obvious that this shouldnt be done with teams haha
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> about the ui, the visual style is very clean and i dont think it should change much. given the actual content should change, i wouldnt edit the styling
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> üëåüèº

13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> still playable today, but lots of bots
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Omg I want this for ddnet rn
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Well, you're in the dev channel. If you can program or find a way to fix this, let us know!
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–°eeper> Looks like UPD is being filtered
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–°eeper> 
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–°eeper> what is this?
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–°eeper> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014142040797347870/unknown.png
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, bizarre, an ipv6 server in the wild?
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Might be one of those chinese InfClass servers, not sure
14:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> do you even have ipv6? my isp doesn't provide it for example
14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Mine neither. I wonder how we even handle that
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we should try to contact an ipv6 server at the very start to determine if we even have ipv6 connectivity
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> I have it but tunnelled ipv4 has major lags and i don't get both
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> So i disabled it ^^
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Too bad tw still stuck at ipv4 xd
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> when the chinese are trying to get their own servers restricted to only chinese
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :thonk:
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> would at least fix their ddos
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> üòÑ
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> true, from now on restrict rus servers to only russian and filter russian ips from other servers
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :kekw:
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> that would 100% solve it, since most of the ddosers are russian
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> or polish
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> :think_bot:

18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk windows 11 ui kinda nice ngl
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it looks like any generic modern app
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> which looks nice
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i mean its the best default ui by far imo
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it's not nice
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> rounded corners everywhere like some electron crap
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think rounded looks nice
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> win10 far better
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> you can tell it was designed by a graphic designer and not a HUD designer, but they have made things alot harder to use
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> when they discontinue 10 I'm gonna have to use penguin os
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh yeah i heard lots of buttons are hidden beside more> menus
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> should have hired me, I do both

19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Youtube xd
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but its so ez to create awesome gui with all the javascript frameworks
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> took me like 20 minutes to create a pretty good map releases filter in react
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wish it could be so ez with c++
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> can't tell if you're joking or not
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> im not
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> gimme a second
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i show u
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe it's just me but I hate this look where literally everything is rounded and flashing and popping up for no reason
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say depends on the framework u use
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i used MUI which implementents googles material UI
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://aliveclan.de/releases
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> note: i am not saying it looks good, but for like 20 minutes work its better than anything we have in the client
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well it has this same look and feel as everything else nowadays
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and where is your problem with it?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> show me anything comparable in the client
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in fact it has less "roundings" than our ugly client GUI
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> which has rounding next to other roundings
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://tenor.com/view/discordmemes-gif-25118502
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> looks like total crap compared to this
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well I think I've said this before but the client has its own soul and that at least makes it stand out
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> very nice
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> and exaggerated roundings are okay in a game about jumping balls, but on websites it just looks stupid
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say the page above has not too many roundings
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it looks cleaner than our current website
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well the current website does look very dated but going with the most generic thing possible is not the only way to make it more modern
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well if we have some google designers laying around doing awesome css effects for us
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can live with a custom solution
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I think we're moving towards all apps and websites being standardized to all look the goddamn same
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well tho there is an amount time required to do this:
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just look at the frameworks i used:
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> react - facebook
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mui - implements googles ui
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nextjs - twitch
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> recoil - facebook
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's like sillicon valleys biggest players
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well tho there is an insane amount time required to do this:
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just look at the frameworks i used:
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> react - facebook
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mui - implements googles ui
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nextjs - twitch
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> recoil - facebook
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's like sillicon valleys biggest players
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> they also use these frameworks so they are pretty stable and well thought through
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am not saying javascript is the best shit, but i'd say the GUI frameworks for javascript are unbeatable
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and the themes are built around these frameworks
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so yeah, u kinda have to live with similar looking stuff
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> whats the point of standing out and being urself then
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'm sure you can make something better with oldschool methods if you just keep it tasteful
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> doesn't have to be complex at all
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nope
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u never used react so you dont understand why it changes the game
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is no framework similar
19:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but you simply don't need all this
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> as said i built it in 20 minutes
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs react is built to make this simply
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah that's what it's good for
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but when you see a program from a large company, even something like windows 11 and it has this same stank xD
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Vue is pretty similar. I also saw some lightweight alternatives to React more suited for weaker devices. Either way I find the virtual DOM approach just another bandaid to the way web has to keep full backwards compatibility for decades
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but the optimizer prerenders, so you get a static html on first load
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But yes, angular, vue and react are your best bets if you are building a site now. Making something without any of them is just way too much work
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which is another bandaid on the bandaid. The entire modern web is a massive ball of bandaid üòÑ
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ^^
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It might just be that CSS+HTML has just become way too powerful. The flexibility just causes way too much complexity
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but yeah, it's really about development speed:
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nodejs + react triggers hot replacements so i never have to reload the page at all
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i instantly see all changes
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> imagine the same with c++... even with smth like jet-live which is similar to hot replacement its still slow
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, without a framework you need to mess around with webpack to get a hot reloading setup
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The best implementation c++ of hot reload I know is unreal engine and that is sluggish as hell
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Of c++ hot reload*
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> a c++ script language would be nice.. then i can compile for release
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> use script in debug ^^
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also would buy a NASA pc for that
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I don't know if C++ is interpretable without some extra rules
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd accept a certain amount of extra rules üòÑ
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe a single TU limit and no forward declarations
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and if u do smth game breaking restarting is ofc ok
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but ddnet UI for example would be ez with jet-live
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can just recompile and it works bcs our ui has almost no state
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Honestly in our codebase hot reload isn't even my biggest issue. Our code compiles quick enough that I dont lose focus
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The bigger issue is that it's not standardized at all
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I keep having to alternate between coder and designer mode, which is really taxing on the brain
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well anyway, my point is really about making good, ez UI
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and imagine you could search like on my website above and vote a map like that
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> would be really cool üòÑ
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like my clan website
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://uniqueclan.net/
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder who made it
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was willing to make that happen but I think other devs didnt want me to do it out of band
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there is a new kid in the school
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its called svelte
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://svelte.dev/
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Some component hierarchy, some event bubbling, some standardization of ui components would go such a long way
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like e.g. I want a component to be "cached", I have to look at containers and stuff for like 50 minutes. This could probably be transparent to the designer if done well
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this also exists https://github.com/pintariching/rustle
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i cannot judge but before some bigger company used it idc xDD
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> depends on how well it scales
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its way way faster
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> than reactjs
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz it does the work at compile time xD
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014242097236283412/unknown.png
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but nextjs does that too
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it renders the first render and makes it a html file
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nextjs uses react
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw svelte can only be compared to reactjs
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you could say that svelte already does pre rendering by how it works
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sveltekit is what you compare to nextjs
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look at how svelte works :p
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What work? Does it figure out the chain of updates required at compile time to create optimized routines or sth?
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it doesnt use a virtual dom
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014243164971876492/unknown.png
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now that sounds impressive. I'll take a look
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it uses a custom jsish syntax
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That 1.6 kb bundle size is sexy too
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a interactive tutorial
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> brb food
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but not at first render?
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> else i understand https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> incorrectly
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it uses javascript as soon as you e.g. fetching data or change site etc.
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No state management libraries is also hot
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I might give Svelte a go for my next project
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its called hydration
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> server side rendering
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway, its normally that newer libs are better in smth
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but it probs doesnt have such a huge community behind it
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> svelte can do SSR too iirc
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> SvelteKit
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if it gets as good as react i have nothing against it tho ^^
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> svelte is definitly getting traction
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see it here and there in hn
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its normal
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tbh i dont really care about javascript anyway, i want smth like react in c++
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 4 years ago reactjs was the sme
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same!
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this will be possible
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when wasm matures
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and doesnt need to call js to manipulate the dom
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with rust having wasm as first class its even better
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://yew.rs/
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look at this
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i wonder if there will be smth like a electron wasm edition
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> web assembly is the future
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that would be dope
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the only way to make js die
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> forever
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and finally
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> all javascript gone, makes it much smaller probs
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and wasm can be probs optimized easier
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its assembly after all
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found this today on hn
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> was kind of a good readm
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not hacker as in script kiddy but programmer
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the word surely lost a lot of meaningg today
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think its a good article for aspiring programmers
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Voxel :bluekitty:
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> whats up
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> interesting article

21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if someone says "GitHub discussions" please ban me from this server
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> learath said it in 2018 already and it was talked about before for sure ^^
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> github discussi
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> what does lazy loading mean anyways
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u load as soon as u need
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> rn it loads all at client start
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> all that im saying is that it was agreed with because someone who said it has a green name.
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the other times my comment was reframed, ignored, and then you can see the third time i tried to change my question to be about all assets
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It was agreed with way before I proposed it üòÑ
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes xD
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well lynn its not about the idea
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its about someone doing it
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> how about u do it?
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not saying whether or not you agree with the idea
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but what was said
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think eeeee was the first one to implement it in teewebs, since then I think everyone wanted it
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh god this again
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well what do u expect?
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ask robyte or codedev, they currently the most active devs
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am currently doing some web dev, bcs i need some off time of client stuff
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i only fix bugs
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im just bitching about how im frequently ignored or discounted as a new player or a troll and i was already sick of it but i just see patterns still xD
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it has nothing to do with "is lazyloading a good idea"
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bro srsly, u doin drama rn
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> most ppl dont even understand it
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you also don't know my experience with being a moderator
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ye ok nvm
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just do it, pr it it gets merged
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> discussion over
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not the point
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well most ppl are assholes, never noticed it before?
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then i tell ya now
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> people are disproportionately assholeish to certain people. so much fuckin bias in this community xD
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you tell me "do it"
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just change ur mind, do what u think is best, show others that u are doing it better
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I've done shit in the past and no one cares
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> I remember a discussion with lynn which didn't end well for me and i didn't know what i did wrong. So my advice is to leave jupstar:justatest:
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe u want too much attention
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> tried
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nooob is a racist or something i don't remember the conversation
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ignore that
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he cant beat me over internet i really give a fuck xD
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe if he's my best friend
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> oh convenient that it's in a server i left
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok anyway, pls do it in #off-topic thanks
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> only political drama and nuclear fission drama in dev channel, no personal drama xD
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> on the topic of something dev related
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i want to make proper ddnet dev tools that will aid for very niche things, like tee animations or automapper generators
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> actual problem with the community != personal drama imo
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it doesn't belong here anyway but idc
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lynn, everything what u say or me saying or someone else saying into the void will not be implemented until u will not try to implement it
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ive wasted my time before, im sure if i at least coded something it could be PRed
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i don't know cpp
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its actually disrespectful asking devs to implement something
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> especially when u forcing it
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not asking devs xD
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> ya you are clearly not understanding at all
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> then what the topic of ur lil drama here
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> üôÑ
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i said the same thing learath said and then someone was like oh yes we should do that
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> because i am frequently ignored
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> people are sick of me
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> they wish i would leabe
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean murpi litteraly said that downloaded skins is basically that
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> they wish i would leave
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> thats what i said u rn
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also learaths statement was right after a client crash
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc another dev more likely says "oh yeah we should"
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no you said im forcing devs to do something
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok u clearly out for drama rn
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think with the current setup of ddnet's coding its hard to actually make any real **improvements**
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> jupey you don't even understand how often this happens
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> dont take him literaly xD
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> wtf, they will agree if they want to
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> theyre all humans
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> if they didnt respond u or something then what
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think (in total) the changes ive been able to contribute was the idea of USA2 and official DDNet xPanic servers but that is under an iceberg of stuff that has been ignored
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sometimes i even dont respond bcs it feels "too forced"
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. if deen posts some nice stat or smth
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i have about 30k messages in this server
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its weird if everybody would be like
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> OH YEAH NICE xD
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> all of mine were questions
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> same timing as recent skin changes
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it was most convenient time for anyone to say "oh yeah"
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i think if you want something to be changed you are accountable for learning how to make that change yourself
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway, now u have ur answer, so better late than never i guess, even if it was not answered to you directly
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeaah
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> same
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Time management in developing a free game is always the main problem
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i gave up doing things for ddnet cuz a) someone does it really faster then me b) they do it 100 times better than me xd
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> now i can only asking for features and asking for opinions
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> than*
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i still have motivation to do things, because they're like really really niche ideas that none of the devs want to have the time to make
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> like; what if tees had a run animation for when they go fast enough? what if they sat down when they were afk, or standing on a certain entity block?
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> how can we improve the demo ui where it becomes more readable?
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> how can we make the tees custom colors less... ugly?
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> uhm last one is super niche idea that will not appear in ddnet
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> voxel i am happy that you have a better track record of people listening to you, it is just unfortunate that there is a disparity xD
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> that was my whole point and now i rq
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> lynn barely anyone listens to me
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you already got a change in ddnet
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> he did it himself
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> nobo
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you're newer in the community than me
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> voxel does alot himself actually
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> all his drawings, the SVG stuff
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no one knows what i tried to do is the problem xD
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ofc its easier like that
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> hell i had an entire pitch deleted out of #showroom becuase murpi thought it was irrelevant LOL
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so this conversation is really easy for you
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wait
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> how about this:
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> You contribute smth and in the same line you ask a question... then u probs wont get ignored üòÑ
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :troll:
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe voxel is less ignored bcs he also changes stuff
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I've wasted too much time already, if I actually knew C++ it may be accepted but you're a dev and don't see other sides of the game
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you are putting this too much in dev context
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i know little to no c++ LMFAO
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if ravie would tell me i draw everything u want in the next 3 weeks, i'd listen to him much more closly ofc
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs he'd basically be a working partner in that time
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I have tried both ways. Doing stuff without explicit approval and ending up wasting my time later and instead asking about the idea, fully explaining it, and people tell me "ok but you didn't finish it so i don't have an answer for you"
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's a double standard
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well what exactly is wasted times anyway?
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i don't have access to mod chat anymore
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i can't really count the hours
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe u are simply overloading ppl?
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @.@
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not like we sitting here and reading every single message
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i rq
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> enjoy game
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no jupey
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i muted all channels except question and bugs
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you just do not understand
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think ur problem is simply that you overestimate this community
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you don't understand full context + scope + amount of messages + amount of ideas
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> most ppl just want to play
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and most devs already have lots of ideas
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> even without your ideas, even if they are great
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> as soon as they respond they are also kinda into the topic
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i am very practical about my estimation of this community, but people rather do other things with their tike
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> time
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> lynn i LOVE your ideas and tbh id try to impliment it if i knew how
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you would be wasting your time
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it's already tagged internally as a "Lynn" idea xD
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> ??? whats the sudden change in tone
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so it will get f4
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> nope
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> lynn there is no bias here
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> at least i dont think os
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> I've already talked about it
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> at least i dont think so
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> the only person who would be able to explain is Skeith
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i also think you are imaginating it a bit, there probs is some biased group around in the community, but that doesnt mean that all ppl are.
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> For most ppl its really about time
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what i said was a joke btw
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but it does feel that way
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> :HUHH:
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> someone doing bookkeeping behind the scenes like "oo lynn is typing again"
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lynn u have such good imagination
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> not only for a game but i for this channel too
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well anyway if you cant provide evidence of what exact situation you are annoyed abbout, i have to ignore you, bcs its drama rn
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you get ignored in some mod channel than i bet its simply bcs lots of ideas = lots of work = less time
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that simple
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> anyways i love this game more than anyone ever realizes but it's exactly for that reason why i feel like i can't be a part of the community. it's too bittersweet from my past and honestly my life might be better if i just stop talking
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i love this game probably more than half the staff
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> it doesn't matter
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> half of the staff probs contributed more than just ideas
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and thats usually work
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just accept it
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i guess how heated people are contesting even something simple like being ignored is a final nail for me
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> all I said is that I felt ignored. and everyone is making up other argumebta
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> arguments
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i hate that type of anxiety. i feel that every time i make a pr, the sigh of a dozen developers every time i dont clang format
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> idk it might be a different point but
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Staff is always the one making the mistakes. Hard life being staff
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but deen always says he gleadly does that for any contributor
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u just have to ask him ofc
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> he knows that not everyone uses linux and knows tools like clang-format
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah my pr also got clang formatted by deen afair
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> thing is, i have a tool on VSCode that helps with clang format so it's turning out a bit better in that sense
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> the one I told u?
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> okay but i am serious though, i just got a job recently for anyone who cares (i guess you can reference this message as my last) and probably doing more irl stuff. my past is littered with times I've tried to help the community or do something specific and it's either ignored, reframed into a new conversation, or downright rejected. i have had many ideas that i knew had clear solutions and even some people backed me up. but it wasn't enough, i
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> 
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> :lynnyaLove:
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but still i feel like you are not realistic
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> an idea can also be a risk, and if u just provide the idea and are not here to also take responsibility than its simply extra work for devs
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. coding:
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u add a bug, u should at best also fix that bug. u cannot expect to just implement some idea and then rq
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ofc that doesnt mean that it must be perfect or smth. It's really simply that the game keeps to stay running
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> post your idea what you are most annoyed about, else this discussion is pure drama...
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we need some case to talk about maybe its clear than why it got rejected
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or if its really as awesome as you think maybe u find ppl backing u up here
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but still i feel like you are not realistic
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> an idea can also be a risk, and if u just provide the idea and are not here to also take responsibility than its simply extra work for devs/staff
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> e.g. coding:

21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> post your idea what you are most annoyed about, else this discussion is pure drama...
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i remember myself trying to do server-side bots for ddnet and like "lol it seems im making another game"
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i believe ddnet will abandon teeworlds
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> its just keeping legacy rn
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea there's a whole discussion of if we should just give up on keeping the teeworlds coding style,
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I agree with voxel, if you want something done you have to learn how to do it yourself maybe if you're lucky someone else will do it but that rarely happens in my experience
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah voxel is right, there is no idea in oss world huh
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i got EXTREMELY lucky with my first pr, the multicolored laser things. it would not be a thing if it wasnt for fokko actually knowing how the communication between server and client works
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well he rq anyway xd
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> give him 2 days
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> wait she left?
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ye
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> DAMN
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no shared servers with lyyn so yes
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> @Voxel ask her on lynn lounge
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i dont want to force it harder onto her. i think the most i can do now is listen
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Did lynn actually contribute any code to ddnet?
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> afair ye
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Last time I checked I only saw some grammar fixes, that's all
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1014264981786734592/unknown.png
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> and quite a few issues
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> xd
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> i have found myself in contributors but not lynn for some reasons
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and found voxel
22:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I kinda question how we contribute the dev role üëÄ
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <funman> gib dev pls
22:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> btw lynn did something on ddnet xpanic so no worries xd
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> yea xpanic was fun
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> and then no one else wanted to play it so
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> that has nothing to do with ddrace or our project though
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> wait for zhp
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> but ye she did make it somewhat playable (I guess?)
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> they moved on database
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> txt -> mysql
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> thats only big thing i remember
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ah teeflower sans did it
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> copypasted kurosios code :troll:
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> anyways, im thinking about making the all in one tee-poser as a seperate executable; i just need to know how to start it.
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> someone else did the sqlite thing
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Where are all the servers in master?
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> voxel if u want to try something to do i can ask u for **TEE TAUNTS** *sighs*
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> tee taunts?
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> tee taunts
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> like tf2 taunts
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> whats that üëÄ
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> fornite dancing tee
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> smh u don't know about tf2 taunts
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://www.google.com/search?q=tf2+taunts
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lmfao
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> fortnite dancing tee
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> I never got into tf2, didn't like it
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> was more of a csgo type of guy ^^
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah im also
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but taunts jus tdiwespreade
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> tee-poser?
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> d
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> hmm. if i were to make taunts/animated emotes, i would have to actually make a program to deal with animation quicker
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> like check out fortnite and super animal royale for example
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> my pitch is i want an easy app thats like the tee assember online, except with more features
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> u need to refactor animating system firstly i think
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> but idk actually
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> where you can: export tee poses, view animated states, change colors, possibly have a mode with a dummy where hook is always active
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah, i started to do that once, just a skin renderer into png, left it mid work, as usual üôÇ
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> okay, we're not talking same thing i think
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> yours is edit tool
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i just wanted renderer
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> fair
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> i want a way to export high quality tee PNGS for youtube thumbnails without the need of greenscreen
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> animateeng
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> tl;dr plz
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> looks like a lot of DDrama
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lynn rq, voxel does anima edit tool
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> lynn rq bcuz they felt undermined
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> lynn rq because she's a snowflake
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> she's part of a group of people that does not accept criticism and reject any differing opinion
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> reminds me of some political party in recent history
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> #off-topic for my take
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> I wonder if teeworlds was made in C# if there would be way more active devs
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> it feels like there's not that many for how big the community is
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> maybe. but that involves me learning MORE terms
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> lol what?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> C# is not that hard compared to C++ unless you make it complicated on purpose I guess
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> C# is basically a java clone right?
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> well
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> kinda but not really
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> idk much about java tbh
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd say 90% clone
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> I don know either, i have seen some memes about that
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> https://github.com/Matodor/TeeSharp
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> under huge refactoring rn
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Broso56> lol teesharp
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> does it actually work?
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> it reimplements the entire client and server?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> dk about client but server
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and mLife is teesharp thing
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and such good thing i would say
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> C# is just much more noob friendly for modding, you trivially make changes to a game with something like dnSpy which has round trip decompilation. also there's things like Harmony which makes mod loading easy

22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh thats handy!
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Tater> also rip dnSpy, microsoft made the dev disappear or something
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> deez nuts spy
