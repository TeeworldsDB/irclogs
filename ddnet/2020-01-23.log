00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [12:15 PM] Im 'corneum: noby would be the guy but i dont think he cares much about ddrace
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> yeah i dont care about ddr really but i would be interested to work with any big server on anti cheat stuff
00:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i have asked before about a way to replay teehist files thru a server that can run different types of anti bot checks im not sure what happened to this
13:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen did you create the directory ~/.teeworlds/dumps/servers ? Idk maybe it was still 0.6 log system before fokko merged with vanilla and now itâ€™s 0.7 style starting from dumps dir
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I just merged the last few weeks
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Hmm
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I noticed complains about missing name change feature should we reimplement that for ddnet7?
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> So at least ddnet clients can change names
13:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Im sure gamer would also adapt
14:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh and @deen could you please turn off circleci and appveyor so we can get our green checkmark back ðŸ™‚ both are replaced by github actions now
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon Yes, name change would be cool, also thought about that with the ddnet client.
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the logging system changed for sure
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i just tested it
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> or well not sure if it changed but currently it is 0.7 style
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen Could you deactivate the CI services, please? GitHub Actions does the work now.
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (in DDNet7)
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @onby nothing happened there yet ðŸ˜¦
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What do you mean deactivate the services
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You mean remove the webhooks?
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they fail the builds cause their files got removed already
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ok, removed them
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where are we building now?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> GitHub Actions, as I said
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Does github host the vms?
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Yes
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 and provide compiled/packaged binarys as public download
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 just check the build now, on this commit
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i could not reproduce the logging issue
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not before and not after the merge
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> the second merge
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> any reason you didn't upgrade the 0.6 repository aswell?
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> why not
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 did not find the time yet i prioritize things that support 0.7 obviously
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> obviously, who cares about the stable version of ddnet we are supposed to be maintaining while there is cutting edge 0.7 to mess around with
15:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> appreciation of my work at this point
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You should fix the artifact names too btw
15:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm?
16:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> whats wrong
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> the artifacts are prefixed by `teeworlds-`
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah ye idk where that comes from was too lazy yet xd
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's at the very bottom of the workflow file
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The last step, uploading of artifacts
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Make that ddnet7 to match the others? ðŸ˜›
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> DDNet7*
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> or not?
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> teeworlds used all lowercase, I thought you'd want to be compliant
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can we pls rename ddnet6 to ddnet6 and ddnet7 to ddnet :p
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You wish
16:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ™‚
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 can we get a badge with a useful link? ðŸ™‚
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure, where would you like it to head?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> To the workflow page?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> somewhere where I can see a more detailed status
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Will do in a sec
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 apparently there is no link to the latest run, best I can do is link to the page with all runs
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <redix> that page is not public i think
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, yep that's not public
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I don't see anything to link to that'd be useful, except maybe the latest commit itself
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sadly their links are not handled that well so you can look at `commit/master`Â but not `commit/master/checks`Â you need the full commit sha for that
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> apparently they are working on a public version of the /actions page so I guess we can wait for that
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @JFox seems to have a libcurl issue I can't diagnose, it's timing out and giving it more time doesn't seem to help but he can access the link from a browser and that works
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao how does one append maps?
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> top left
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And what does appending a map do? :P
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just adds the layers from the second map to the first?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually, this seems to be taken care of
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> merges the other map into the current map, excluding game layers
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> btw that could be optimized to discard duplicate layers/images/envelopes/etc
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It could be, but the problem ravie mentions seems to be accounted for in the code
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if it doesn't work, it's a bug
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> can u link code?
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh @jao the editor pro could you please add quad mass delete ðŸ™‚
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its easy to shift select quads and spam then all over the place and then it takes ages to move or delete them
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki what is a CChatCommands and why didn't you abuse the console like we did for it? ðŸ˜›
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Abuse?
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao game/editor/io.cpp:L1322
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U mean the server side commands added on 0.7.4
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Is smth wrong?
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not really, I was just wondering why you didn't just let the console handle it
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I added a packet i think its way better
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 i made the server redirect the packet to the console, like through the chat
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I understand the packet, I don't understand why you don't just execute the command as a console line to get the free argument parsing and stuff
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (ddnet7)
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/commit/0d88a4d649fef9ce4ef98041b55782ade1b22caa
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idi
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idk
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I made it simple, you can do like fokkonaut i guess
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess keeping it abstract like this is good enough, should be simple enough to override it
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Better not bloat it, u know how sensible tw devs are
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :lol:
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki I added this to official ddnet7 already
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nice
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L641
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> only added more or less important commands for now
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> also, added this cmdlist entry, when executing that, it will send the cmdlist, thats what Com_Cmdlist is for
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki is there autocompletion btw?
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, using enter
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Only for command
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so the server is sending the cmdlist aswell
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sadly
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hardcoded?
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I planned to add autocompletion someday but holidays ended
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> > send the cmdlist
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its the same, old cmdlist in chat
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L648
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Server sends 1 packet to client with info about a command
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I added this, so player can select it with the arrow keys, and if they hit enter it will send the cmdlist
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L653
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Interesting, I'll take a peek
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I needed to modify the parameters for the command callback, and I added a check, whether the callback is 0 or not, if yes, execute the command like an old command, using the ExecuteLine thing, but if there is a callback, then of course it, like Com_Cmdlist
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ```void CLayerTiles::ModifyEnvelopeIndex(INDEX_MODIFY_FUNC Func)
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> {
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> }```
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> empty function
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do Tile layers even have envelopes?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yes
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> color animations
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What for?
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ooh
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> could we maybe display the envelope name in the layer menu?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> ok too hard
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> > What for?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> To change color of tiles? xd
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i use it sometimes to do pulsating freeze
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u can also make flickering startlines
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> rainbow main tiles idk
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @ChillerDragon fix the macos bug in my pr
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yikes
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> where
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2046/checks?check_run_id=405569325
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> hdiutil: create failed - no mountable file systems
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> y i see
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yikes
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> python2 lol
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yikes
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> didnt build any 0.6 mac in a while idk right now
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe run it with sudo? xd
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> upgrade to py3 :D
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki why is there a MAX_COMMANDs btw? the autocompletion thing can't scroll?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, sadly
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can only have 22 commands in there max
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm, guess I'll have to code that first
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> what are you trying to do?
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well just making this into a complete feature
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> With no command limit and autocompletion
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> autocomplwetion is there
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Autocompletion for commands the client doesn't have to know about before compilation that is
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, that is already there indeed
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Couldn't get mine to complete for some reason ðŸ¤”
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> enter
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 will they be sorted alphabetically?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> dont know whether they should or not
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it breaks freedom
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @ChillerDragon what happend, why do the workflows complete now
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
19:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> idk
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe ur branch was behind the fix from learath
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I re ran them, it had trouble with the macOS vm
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> some stupid bug with storage mounting
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, workflows break bors too
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is there a way to get the max amount of glyphs that will fit in a given width?
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª you'd know if there is one
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do u know the font size?
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if so you can load the glyph metrics and just advance a variable by the glyphs width + its bearing
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 is there any ddnet tool or libtw thingy where i can search for ddnet map settings? I tried ``strings`` but that doesnt seem to work
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao can you try the envelope thing?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª yeah I know the size
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But I don't know the text in advance
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah, then its impossible
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u can load the max possible width of a glyph tho
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon you can run config_retrieve on a map to get the config out of it
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i knew there was soemthing like that awesome thanks
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/tutorial/step2.html
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 3. Global Glyph Metrics
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> max_advance_width
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> when i run apt install ddnet-tools do i have that in my path?
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh that sounds like it'd be useful
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Who knows, idk how we package ddnet for distros
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if you build it'll be in your build directory
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> do you need it for teeworlds @Learath2
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª yeah
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then remember the font size is recalculated to a virtual screen size
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hoq does it work @Learath2 ? i excpedted a config in stdout or something
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/669988081851433000/unknown.png
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/client/text.cpp#L805
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon I think it needs to be mapname outputfilename
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> [2020-01-23 20:33:57][usage]: ./config_retrieve FILE1 [ FILE2... ]
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats unintuitive
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª so I need to scale the max_advance_width the same way, right?
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah nvm it created a cfg next to the map thanks a lot @Learath2
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> better scale the font size and load the metrics for the actual font size then
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> should be documted somehow
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> freetype can round some metrics for some font sizes up and down
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª Well we already have the font loaded, I was thinking of using that
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/tools/src/bin/settings.rs
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> literally the tool you asked for
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yea @heinrich5991 learath was faster but thanks ðŸ™‚
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I'm guessing the libtw one can output to stdout and has better documentation ðŸ˜›
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah but metrics are always per font size
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you cannot use font size 100 and just recalculate variables, because freetype has some degree of freedom
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 envelope thing works
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> oh wait u mean ur pr
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 cp the truncate code from how image names are rendered in layer menus
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª how do we afford to load the font in the wrong size and then scale it then?
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> a font is not really size depended, you can request a fontsize and freetype calculates the font u are using to that metric
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> font glyphs are vectorized most often
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes(pFont->m_FtFace, 0, pSizeData->m_FontSize);`
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> CalculateTextWidth
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> right i use for the gametile layers `CalculateTextWidth`
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but not sure rn if its limited to numbers only
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well u need a textless version anyway
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but maybe that gives u the idea
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @jao thanks for the tip, done
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª hmm, I can't quite say I get it. If a font is not aware with which size it's loaded, how does it know the max_advance_width?
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thought u know the font size
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then u can just tell freetype
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When we load a font we call `FT_New_Face`, The `FT_Face` we get has the field `max_advance_width`. Yet we gave no indication of font size yet
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The global metrics are given in "font units" apparently
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes(pFont->m_FtFace, 0, AcutalFontSize);`
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `int MaxTextCharacters = (int)((float)Width / (pFont->m_FtFace->size->metrics->max_advance >> 6));`
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but you do know the font size?
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Depends on what you mean by fontsize. I know it in terms of the units CTextRender would use
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Idk what CText/CTextRender would push to underlying freetype though
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> text render gets a font size
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then recalculates it to fit the transformation from virtual screen to actual screen size
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then u can use the actual size to get the font size displayed on your actual monitor
20:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and thats also the font size freetype needs
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/engine/client/text.cpp#L1397
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just use the code and all vars needed to get that actual size
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats the font size u can then use in `FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes`
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What's the idea with a virtual screen anyway, I never really touched much of the graphics code
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why are we doing all this rescaling?
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think mostly so full hd looks same as 4k
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs same aspect ratio
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tw also uses it too define a maximal possible view distance
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno hard to explain, tw makes some weird stuff
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tw is also flipped upside down
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just to flip it upside down in the end xd
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but actually to make it ez to create the gui
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> from top to buttom ðŸ˜„
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should read all this sometime
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why are you shifting the max advance btw?
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if i remember correctly freetype uses a own metric which isnt pixels
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and thats how u get the pixels xd
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `The metrics found in face->glyph->metrics are normally expressed in 26.6 pixel format (i.e., 1/64th of pixels)`
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, for fractional placement
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno if thats only for glyphs
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ` They are expressed in 26.6 pixel format but rounded for historical reasons.`
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so should be right
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thanks @Jupstar âœª
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 i dont like the wider menu
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> and u still need to show the envelope number since names arent unique
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> like "6: name" if it has a name otherwise just the number
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, I thought wider would be better, I can shrink it down again
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> youre also not checking if the name is empty
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fixed both
21:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Freetype is special
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I don't quite like that you have 2 copies of CChatCommand, 1 on the client and 1 on the server, but  I don't see a nicer way to do it either
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you have something in mind that you didn't do because you didn't feel like spending the time?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 sending current args to sv to request autocompletion values
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> All its own packeta
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Packets
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> If packet is too big just put a flag that more autocompletion values will arrive on thebprevious packet
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Idl if its good idea but i was lazy
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 looks good now
21:51 <+Learath2> @jao feel free to merge it then
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> wrong jao
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tea> forgot to change name back lol
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, there is another jao ðŸ˜›
