01:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> @noby
01:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> why would he be banned
01:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Voxel> from ddnet?
01:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> ?
02:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> yeah hes banned i banned him
03:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Souly> :nouis:
04:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> ye he bots all the time
04:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if u see him in-game dm me
06:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> No, but if u just say that I can not know u mean anything with dummy xd
10:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @heinrich5991 what do you think about writing the assert messages to disk somehow, else the information is often lost (if not ez to reproduce it might be useful)
11:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds good. best would be to also write the log to disk somewhere recoverable
11:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @deen\: Im sorry if i upset you i will never say anything about putin or russia again so please unban me
11:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe we should scan our logs regularly
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> what would be great for the assert message would be to also print a stacktrace
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> drmingw will print a stack trace for windows
11:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but sadly no textual information
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> for linux it should be relativly easy to print a stacktrace
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> wait, or do we create a coredump on dbg_assert?
12:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> that's even better then, no need for stacktrace
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i dont think we do that rn
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> drmingw just catches illegal instructions
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but yeah coredump sounds good
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I mean on Linux, for official servers
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> oh i guess linux does that automatically, if you enable core dumps?
12:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> because with coredump we have the message, stack, and all context
12:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and the core.$pid files are not overwritten a day later
12:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yep, works:
12:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ```

12:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> One other thing I wanted to do about this was to keep around the old builds
12:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> because sometimes I only look into a coredump a few days later, and then we already run a new server version
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> Hey!
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> 
14:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> Would it be possible to perhaps display upcoming map releases on the website?
14:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Not so easy with how it's set up at the moment, would have to be manually maintained
14:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> Aww, thought so \:(
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> can't the bot just read map-releases channel
14:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i mean i guess you want it for yourself?
14:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> the matrix bridge also links to wiki, so doesnt sound so hard to add more channels
15:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> I'm fine with that aswell, I'm guessing Zwelf is the one in charge of it?
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that would be easier, I don't know who runs the bridge bot
15:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Zwelf> #ddnet-map-releases\:matrix.org already bridges those map releases. (You can see all currently bridged channels in #ddnet\:matrix.org
15:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Zwelf> I plan to selfhost the bridge at some point to bridge the remaining channels to matrix and have more moderating control over it.
15:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that would be nice, then i can join back without these insane delays sometimes ^^
15:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> Thanks Zwelf, didn
15:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <furo> Thanks Zwelf, didn't know about that channel as I couldn't find it when searching for it \:D
