00:56 < maple> confirmed
01:02 < laxa> ...
01:02 < laxa> not really
01:09 <@deen> laxa: don't be so agressive in the forum
01:09 <@deen> we never judge maps based on the mapper
01:10 <@deen> i hated that at ddmax, that mappers get their map release date pushed back as punishment for doing something bad
01:12 <@deen> Learath2: I think you recently said that you didn't know whether there are (m)any female players. now a girl even has the most points on ddnet :P
01:16 < eeeee> we used to have quite a few (supposedly) female players on our block servers
01:17 < eeeee> was easy for them cause all the foreveralone guys were protecting them :D
01:18 <@heinrich5991> log in as pinky and get protected. noticed that
01:18 < maple> lol nice
02:56 <@deen> ahaha, correcting exercises
02:56 <@deen> and this guy was supposed to do a type check proof
02:56 <@deen> he started and after 3 lines he started drawing UML diagrams for a game
03:17 < Nimda> Teleport by El Futuro & Broken just released on Novice at 2014-12-04 03:14
04:58 < eeeee> he's probably gonna drop out of uni, found a startup and get filthy rich
05:03 <@deen> eeeee: a bit late for that, i think my students are all in their last year^^
05:16 < eeeee> too bad for him, gonna be forever payroll like the rest of us

08:20 < laxa> deen: honky can speak english well on teamspeak but is too lazy to write english on the forum. I am sorry, but I really feel like it's disrepectfull, how am I suppose to test a solo map if he writes in english ?
08:20 < laxa> in german I mean
08:20 <@deen> tell him that you want to become a tester and don't speak german
08:22 < laxa> You should sleep sometimes deen :p
08:22 <@deen> I did
08:22 < laxa> 3 hours or what ?
08:23 <@deen> last evening, was tired
08:23 < laxa> oh ok
09:57 < laxadedi> deen: take a look at that : http://www.tokutek.com/tokudb-for-mysql/
10:41 < xrothx> laxadedi:  Dedi = windows? 
10:50 < laxadedi> dedi = ubuntu 11.03 LTS
10:51 < xrothx> ok
10:51 < xrothx> with gui?
10:53 < laxadedi> wut ?
10:53 < laxadedi> Hell no
10:53 < laxadedi> using ssh only
10:56 < xrothx> :o
10:56 < xrothx> Ok
11:05 < xrothx> laxadedi:  Ton amis a du temps? 
11:05 < xrothx> Pour un petit travaille en ruby? :D
11:12 < laxadedi> Il boss, je pense pas :)
11:40 < xrothx> Pff.. J'ai besoin d'un simple truc :P 
11:41 < xrothx> Anyone able to do something for me? A small interface. For example on port 1234. I go to IP:1234 And there I can login with admin & 1 password (only1user)
11:42 < xrothx> After I logged in I would like to be able to start/stop/change options and change the map
11:44 < xrothx> thats it ^^ 
12:14 <@deen> laxadedi: what's interesting about that? I'm just laughing at the buzzwords so far^^
12:16 < laxadedi> deen: I don't know if it's free/opensource, but I understood that you like great performances
12:16 <@deen> ah, yes I do
12:16 < laxadedi> so, it's to improve SQL performance
12:16 < laxadedi> it works with mariaDB
12:16 <@deen> but mostly I'd want to reduce the memory requirements of mariaDB
12:16 < laxadedi> I got this link on my school's forum, didn't paid more attention to it
12:16 < laxadedi> but maybe it'll interest you !
12:17 <@deen> performance is so good that every query should be < 1 ms
12:17 <@deen> or somewhere in that direction
12:18 <@deen> from how i uderstand it: you should run tokudb on a separate server since it eats memory like crazy
12:20 <@deen> but thanks anyway
14:50 <@deen> vali is telling people that ddnet client is a botnet that I use to ddos other servers...
15:10 < o_be_one> hi :)
15:11 < o_be_one> LOL serious about vali ? wtf omg x)
15:11 <@deen> i guess he's still worried about how I got his passwords^^
15:11 < o_be_one> lol :D he doesnt know how to read your code ^^
15:38 < BeaR> hey
15:38 <@deen> hi BeaR 
15:42 < BeaR> what's the result of the race map discussion?
15:42 <@deen> We will add a separate race server
15:42 <@deen> aaa is heading the decisions about which maps to add and how to fix them, I hope Welf & Index will help hi
15:42 <@deen> m
15:43 < BeaR> ok nice (:
15:44 <@deen> you have a good knowledge of race maps?
15:44 <@deen> if you want to help, you can get in touch with aaa
15:44 < BeaR> didnt play much race, the only nice looking map I know is run_sunsetcave
15:45 < BeaR> but I can ask died
15:47 <@deen> don't know him, but sure
16:43 < o_be_one> dafuck there is a feature with tile buttons to show or hide tiles oO ?
16:43 <@deen> don't understand
16:43 < o_be_one> im watching the video on ddnet.tw
16:44 <@deen> nope, there is not
16:44 <@deen> it's just a part cloned many times
16:44 < o_be_one> and i see a map with tile that are use as buttons to clip or noclip tiles
16:44 <@deen> and you get teleported
16:44 < o_be_one> oh ok
16:44 < o_be_one> would be awesome as real feature ahah, i can just remember "Mario" :p
16:44 <@deen> yeah, but would totally lose vanilla compatibility
16:45 <@deen> see minetee
16:46 < o_be_one> :(
16:52 < Learath2> we had a version of ddrace 0.7 with dropped vanilla compatibility that can do all that

20:27 < Nimda> Aim 6.0 by Aoe & Loop just released on Brutal at 2014-12-04 20:24
21:54 <@deen> i could use all the ddnet servers as a fuzzing cluster :P
21:57 < Maple> fuzzzz
22:58 < eeeee> or embed fuzzer in the client and use all the players' computers as a fuzzing cluster
23:00 < eeeee> call it "advanced proactive security technology"
23:14 <@deen> great idea!
23:14 <@deen> needs some "cloud" in there somewhere
23:32 < Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
