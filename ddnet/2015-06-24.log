00:50 < Savander> good night
00:56 <@heinrich5991> night
01:15 < eeeee> speaking of old games, did any of you guys play the original "xcom: ufo defense"? i tried openxcom.org yesterday and it seems to be work nicely, most of original bugs and annoyances are fixed.
02:04 < Edible> is it complete? or do you need old game data?
02:08 < eeeee> you need the old data
02:09 < eeeee> hopefully they will remake the data from scratch as well eventually, like openttd did
02:09 < Edible> it shouldnt be that hard, they are sprites after all
02:10 < eeeee> well there's also a lot of ufopaedia illustrations
02:10 < eeeee> and background images
02:15 <@deen> i think i could never fall in love with xcom
02:16 <@deen> openttd is great though
03:10 < Edible> i wouldnt get into xcom now
03:10 < Edible> now it just seems like farmville to me
03:11 < eeeee> lol
03:11 < eeeee> people dig the modern crappy remakes though
03:11 < Edible> which makes me wonder if youngins play games that are older than they are, regularly.
03:12 < Edible> which remakes?
03:12 < eeeee> like this most recent one http://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/xcombattlefield.jpg
03:13 < Edible> remakes have always existed *cough* sport games *cough*
03:13 < eeeee> which isn't all that bad admittedly, but it's very restricted in what you can do
03:14 < Edible> yeah but... isnt that a shooting game?
03:14 < Edible> shooter/strategy
03:14 < Edible> or w\e xcom is classified as
03:15 < eeeee> idk, but the best selling point of xcom is it's trademark mixture of geoscope strategy and battlescape tactical missions
03:17 < Edible> yep
03:18 < Edible> i have never played xcom fairly
03:19 < Edible> always cheated with cheat engine, so thats the best thing for me
03:23 < eeeee> i played in easy difficulty so it wasn't even that hard, so i might not have needed all the features it had
03:24 < eeeee> but still having them made you feel like you're actually in charge and can do whatever you think is best instead of choosing out of 3 options that game allows you to implement
03:24 < eeeee> (latter is the case with the remake)
03:30 < eeeee> e.g. say you want to shoot an alien with your soldier, but another soldier (without any time units left, so cannot move) blocks line of sight. you can just shoot that guy (even accidentally, lol) or make someone else go and stun him so that he drops to the ground (can even pick up and carry his body later to someone with a medkit. or throw the darn medkit and use it). or shoot a nearby wall with a heavy plasma to create a new opening
03:30 < eeeee> can't do any of that in simplified remakes
03:35 < Edible> wow, so its less tactical... which is what its meant to be!
03:35 < Edible> what a colossal fuck up
10:38 < eeeee> lol i've became a newb after not playing the original xcom for ages. lost half of the crew on the first mission (on the 2nd easiest difficulty)
10:39 < eeeee> was a night mission tho
10:53 <@EastByte> I don't know these games :/
10:53 <@EastByte> good morning eeeee 
11:31 <@EastByte> trying to create a named pipe in nim, not realizing permission 0666 is parsed as decimal ^.^
11:33 <@deen> heh
11:48 <@deen> oh, about binaries: i started using file endings for everything else instead, like readme.md, license.txt
11:48 <@deen> so I can at least exclude binaries in the gitignore reliably: https://github.com/def-/nim-brainfuck/blob/master/.gitignore
11:50 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: maybe try 0o666?
11:51 <@deen> heinrich5991: yep, that works
11:59 <@EastByte> deen: haha doing it vice versa will probably work, yes
12:01 <@heinrich5991> it's easier for windows users: *.exe
12:02 <@EastByte> unfortunatly

12:21 < Savander> deen,  maybe sometimes you should send broadcast about "Call fo Testers" ? Not everyone have account on forum, so maybe we'll find people ?
13:01 <@deen> hm
13:02 <@deen> i don't know, maybe testers feel forced to test then
13:02 < Savander> they "should"
13:04 <@deen> no, they should not
13:04 < Savander> you don't pay them, but if they want to be 'testers', they should do something, if they don't want, they shouldn't be a tester. I know, they do it for free
13:04 <@deen> they should do what they want, if that's testing then great
13:04 < Savander> but you can ask people on servers, "we looking for testers"
13:05 <@deen> well, most people aren't fit to be tester
13:05 <@deen> we mainly need experienced mappers as testers
13:05 < Savander> most people don't know about forum
13:05 <@deen> and they usually have sth better to do
13:06 < Savander> You can give a chance for new people, to expand they experience about mapping/testing
13:06 < Savander> like NICO
13:07 < Savander> their*
13:08 < Savander> am i wrong? You don't lose anything 
13:10 <@deen> ok, done
13:11 < Savander> awesome! It'll help ddnet
13:11 < Savander> new blood needed :D
13:12 < Savander> old testers are tired in my opinion
13:12 < Savander> so they need rest^^>
15:05 <@EastByte> the overloaded `/` operator for joinPath is simply awesome
16:26 <@deen> right
16:26 <@deen> have you seen my jsonify macro?
16:26 <@deen> makes it possible to paste regular json into nim
16:30 <@EastByte> deen: I think there was a thread about it
16:31 <@EastByte> it's pretty nice

19:29 <@deen>  /mapinfo Kobra now prints:
19:29 <@deen> "Kobra" by Zerodin on Novice (★★★★✰, 4 points, 14560 finishes, released 1 year and 5 months ago)
19:33 <@EastByte> neat
19:42 <@deen> we could also have more advanced random voting, but not sure how to make the user interface nice and if it's really needed
19:42 <@deen> maybe we should just allow sql queries to vote a map :P
20:45 < Savander> xd
20:45 < Savander> definitly.
20:45 < Savander> with updated and delete permissions
20:46 <@heinrich5991> I'd like to vote for "; DROP TABLE records; --
20:46 <@heinrich5991> and you?
20:50 < Savander> i want to.
20:54 <@deen> haha
21:08 < WolfAlex> @deen: if i enter a wrong map it gives me "" by  on  (, 0 points, 0 finishes)
21:08 <@deen> WolfAlex: oh right, should make a better error
21:38 <@deen> EastByte, Savander: http://ddnet.tw/1tee1.demo http://ddnet.tw/1tee2.demo (should be at the end of last one)
21:38 < Savander> btw
21:38 < Savander> we did it agian
21:38 < Savander> :P :D
21:38 <@deen> nice
21:39 < Savander> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=14&p=17383#p17383
21:39 < Savander> automap, how it works, lul.
21:39 < Savander> it's black magic for me haha
21:40 <@deen> it's a single step of a cellular automaton
21:40 <@deen> at least that's how i always looked at it
21:41 <@deen> http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=581
21:41 <@deen> maybe this helps
21:42 <@deen> basically you say what tile to set depending on the ones set around
21:46 < Savander> Looks at a lot of work ^^

21:58 <@EastByte> (at the end ^^)
22:07 < Savander> i know
22:07 < Savander> tbut in first post
22:07 < Savander> i make it black
22:08 < Savander> ^^^
22:08 < Savander> haha, :D
22:12 <@deen> I'm wondering if I could post DDNet on HN
22:13 < Savander> hn?
22:13 <@deen> Hacker News
22:14 <@deen> maybe i should write a summary of some cool things (like eeeeee's webgl client) on hookrace
22:14 < Savander> 64 slot hack on teeworlds
22:14 <@deen> ^^
22:14 < Savander> fast download by eeee
22:14 < Savander> (im right?)
22:16 < Savander> http://l03.imgup.net/tap5k3xg.gif
22:16 < Savander> hhahaha
22:17 <@deen> ^^
22:17 < Savander> tap tpa tap
22:23 <@EastByte> deen: also the tcp syn cookie like spoof protection would be worth mentioning
22:24 <@EastByte> well it would be a whole post about eeeee's work
22:24 < Savander> ^^
22:29 <@EastByte> we definitly need web livestreaming
22:29 <@EastByte> imagine a webviewer on ddnet.tw showing the current most active servers
22:30 <@deen> yes, would be great!
22:30 <@deen> hack it into the webgl client?
22:31 <@EastByte> would be the way to go
22:31 < eeeee> but ideally we'd find a way to make the webgl client more lightweight first...
22:31 <@EastByte> yep
22:33 < Savander> twitch.tv
22:34 < Savander> deifintly!
22:34 < Savander> most popular stream in the world!
22:34 < Savander> xd
22:34 <@EastByte> nah we don't want video streaming
22:34 < Savander> just joking ^^
22:34 < Savander> but yes, it'd be great.
22:44 <@EastByte> deen: adding demo markers does currently only work for manual demo recorder
22:44 <@EastByte> I would like to add all recorders there
22:45 <@deen> demo markers?
22:45 < Savander> converting demo into avi
22:46 < Savander> woah! 
22:46 <@EastByte> deen: markers on the demo timeline
22:46 <@EastByte> do you know them?
22:46 <@EastByte> "add_demomarker"
22:47 <@EastByte> Savander: if we would have map94 in our team, such a converter might have already been there
22:48 <@deen> nope, don't know
22:48 < Savander> map94?
22:48 <@EastByte> deen: you can use add_demomarker binded ingame
22:49 <@EastByte> and on the demo player there will be a marker on the timeline^^
22:49 <@deen> I'm not sure if we need a demo conversion feature
22:49 <@deen> why not just use ffmpeg?
22:49 <@EastByte> because you need to record first :P
22:50 < Savander> yup :D
22:50 < eeeee> could also hack in video streaming directly into the client
22:50 <@deen> meh, wouldn't want ffmpeg in ddnet client
22:51 <@deen> just adds another 5-10 MB
22:51 <@EastByte> some encoding lib like vpx + dynamic loading would be nice
22:52 <@deen> you would want x264
22:52 < Savander> btw, it'd be great, another "program" to convert demo
22:52 < Savander> into video
22:52 <@EastByte> I don't like x264 :P
22:53 < eeeee> vp8?
22:53 <@deen> eeeee: webm video codec
22:53 < eeeee> yeah i was asking eastbyte if he likes it more
22:54 <@EastByte> it's open and stuff
22:54 <@EastByte> and new
22:55 < eeeee> have heard it's actually a simplified version of h264 so a little bit worse
22:55 <@EastByte> yes, it's less performant (atleast for me)
22:55 <@deen> eeeee: i think the quality compares to h264 baseline (which is the simplified h264)
22:57 <@deen> vp9 is the new one, which should compare to x265
22:57 <@deen> h265*
22:58 <@deen> "On September 12, 2014, Google announced that development on VP10 had begun and that after the release of VP10 they plan to have an 18-month gap between releases of video formats."
22:58 <@deen> sounds like a lot of video formats^^
23:01 < Savander> ^
23:11  * eeeee wonders if VP is gonna catch up to google browser, which is version 45 already
23:12 <@EastByte> ^^
23:12 <@EastByte> eeeee: so I tested the spoof protection sending the real map at the beginning
23:12 <@EastByte> it's not the best idea
23:13 <@EastByte> while downloading a map at this point there is not even a loading screen displayed in the client
23:16 <@EastByte> I think the proper solution is the following: before sending empty snaps the server sends MAPCHANGE+MAPDATA+CON_READY in one packet
23:16 <@EastByte> it works, but of course the map needs to be as small as possible
23:19 <@EastByte> (so basically I'm sending an empty stub map preventing the client from crashing)
23:20 < eeeee> how small is the stub map?
23:21 <@EastByte> just by saving an empty map in editor it's ~500bytes
23:21 <@EastByte> and I hope to be able to decrease the size manually
23:21 <@EastByte> so that's like a challenge
23:22 < WolfAlex> EastByte: empty map is for me 351bytes 
23:23 <@EastByte> deen: what do you think, how small can a tw mapfile be? =)
23:23 < WolfAlex> EastByte: grp 0 deleted
23:23 <@EastByte> well 350 bytes then
23:27 <@heinrich5991> hm.
23:27 <@heinrich5991> 36 byte header
23:28 <@heinrich5991> does it actually need any content?
23:29 < eeeee> in any case, as long as all of that stuff fits in one packet i don't really see a reason to care
23:29 <@EastByte> well we can reduce amplification attacks by decreasing the size
23:29 < eeeee> except maybe to reduce amplification
23:29 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: not sure
23:29 < eeeee> ^^
23:29 <@EastByte> ha!
23:30 <@EastByte> I'm currently trying to find out what is needed for layer/collision init in the client
23:35 <@EastByte> eeeee: btw. there still is the huffman compression and the mapfile contains many zeros
23:36 <@EastByte> not sure how much data actually is left
23:36 <@heinrich5991> huffman compresses these zeroes 8 to 1
23:49 <@EastByte> heinrich5991: well the compressed packet is atleast only half the size
