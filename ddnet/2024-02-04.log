00:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> why do i laugh at such stupid things
00:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> 50/50, either he finishes or he doesnt
00:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> easy!
00:32 < bridge> <deen> 50/50, either I finish it or don't
00:32 < bridge> <deen> üòÑ
00:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> DEEN
00:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> MY JOKE
00:32 < bridge> <deen> two idiots, one thought
00:32 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:
00:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> lmao
01:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That has to be the weirdest flex ever
01:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Donation by teelevision?!!!!  Isn‚Äôt that the guy who run zCatch in the 90s? I did not know he is still around
01:06 < bridge> <chairn> just zero the filesize character?
01:09 < bridge> <chairn> or don't use std::vector for this, you don't need expandable container for reading a file
01:27 < bridge> <jxsl13> that is not him
01:38 < bridge> <smetanolub> is it possible to allow ddnet client connect deepl api for translating chat?
01:39 < bridge> <smetanolub> https://github.com/sienori/simple-translate/wiki/How-to-register-DeepL-API
01:39 < bridge> <smetanolub> its half-free to use legally
01:58 < bridge> <Ewan> Yeah but you have to do it lol
02:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `std::fs::read(filename)` in rust
02:09 < bridge> <heinrich5991> rust doesn't do it with the above-mentioned method
02:10 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in rust you can write to the not-yet initialized parts of the vector and afterwards set its length
02:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> this is guaranteed to be a memcpy for types that support it, I think
02:11 < bridge> <heinrich5991> read it as you'd read the C standard. something will happen, but the result will be the same as if each element was cloned
02:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> btw, even that is very easy to do: https://docs.rs/memmap2/latest/memmap2/
02:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```rs
02:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> let file = File::open("LICENSE-APACHE")?;
02:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> let mmap = unsafe { Mmap::map(&file)?  };
02:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```
02:12 < bridge> <heinrich5991> works on all platforms already
02:13 < bridge> <heinrich5991> (mmap is inherently unsafe, if the underlying file changes)
02:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I feel you. I also like to write efficient code, which is why I started doing it in C. later I found that I could achieve the same in Rust, and to me, it felt a lot easier to get correct
02:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imposter?
02:48 < bridge> <jxsl13> just someone else
02:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Its the same spelling isnt it? https://github.com/Teelevision
02:59 < bridge> <Ewan> how to have a number parameter with clap
02:59 < bridge> <Ewan> this seems obvious
03:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Reusing such a well known name seems a bit problematic to me
03:01 < bridge> <Ewan> nvm
03:02 < bridge> <Ewan> had to use `default_value_t` in the arg() proc macro instead of `default_value`
03:02 < bridge> <Ewan> o_O
03:03 < bridge> <Ewan> sucks that it doesn't come with de/serializers for std::time Duration
03:03 < bridge> <Ewan> i think if u conform to a particular syntax it's easy
03:46 < bridge> <Ewan> well there's my first contribution in rust ü•±
04:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> uhm @avolicious the 2nd hit on duck.com for qshar is some april fool from 2023 about kog shutting down. That seems a bit odd
04:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1707017179.png
04:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also when add a irc bridge to kog so i can stop using ddnet#developer for kog stuff
04:46 < bridge> <Ewan> lol true
04:46 < bridge> <Ewan> idk why you'd wanna talk about kog tho
05:27 < monkyyy> hello i'd like to complain that I joined multimap on usa3, and in 15 seconds batsoup vote kicked me
05:27 < monkyyy> I remember that name being an asshole from eailer so thats probaly not the first time
05:27 < monkyyy> fuck him
06:14 < bridge> <Ewan> dude you should not use the dev channel to complain about a blocker
06:14 < bridge> <Ewan> please create a ticket
06:15 < bridge> <Ewan> mods dont read this chat. too high iq :greenthing:
06:20 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> when creating a ticket from irc?
06:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when turn off kick votes?
07:48 < bridge> <Ewan> when they hire more mods
09:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> omg @robyt3 awesome :3
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen @learath2 when i start ddnet from steam i get:
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ~/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/DDraceNetwork/ddnet/DDNet: symbol lookup error: ~/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/DDraceNetwork/ddnet/DDNet: undefined symbol: curl_multi_poll
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if i start the steam game files without steam (./DDNet) it works
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe steam has it's own curl library?
09:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ^ nightly

10:05 < bridge> <learath2> Aaaaaaaaaaaa
10:07 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks can you find the curl they ship and tell me whether it has `curl_multi_wait`?
10:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sure, which one should i test with? üò¨
10:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1203628674449145966/image.png?ex=65d1c98e&is=65bf548e&hm=2ce8a7b2ff0adc5f4d5cbc17f0eff1b9b9ec2379e173f37546617dded8ed9876&
10:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how can i look up which one is loaded without starting the game?
10:11 < bridge> <learath2> Normally I'd say ldd, but that won't work here
10:14 < bridge> <learath2> @jupeyy_keks how about setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` like steam does to this directory and doing the ldd?
10:14 < bridge> <learath2> That should work
10:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but don't i need the path for that xd
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can just try the one from `.steam/bin32/steam-runtime/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`
10:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that sounds like a useful one
10:16 < bridge> <learath2> That should be it
10:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can't post it for some reason, read pm

11:19 < bridge> <kekomonter> @jupeyy_keks done
11:20 < bridge> <kekomonter> :gigachad:
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 i discovered ive been using my dualsense a bit buggy
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> because i didnt enable osme kernel options
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> now it works nice
11:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sony_DualShock
11:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> it also supports bt sync via usb
11:25 < bridge> <learath2> This os the downside of building your own kernel. You have to be careful üòÑ
11:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:25 < bridge> <learath2> What is a bt sync?
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> bluetooth auto sync
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> bluez says wanna accept this device? y/nn
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Connect the DualShock 3 to the system using a USB cable and press the PlayStation button.
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> > 
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> > Allow the service authorization request:
11:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> > [agent]Authorize service service_uuid (yes/no): yes
11:26 < bridge> <learath2> Ah, I get it
11:26 < bridge> <learath2> I thought sony did that in a proprietary way
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> i couldnt know a reason why do that propietary
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> if ur controller is used for more than ps5 u get more sells
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> i bought my ps5 dualsense for pc and i dont have a ps5
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> 70‚Ç¨ btw
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh it was ur first contribution, epic change üòè
11:29 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
11:30 < bridge> <corneum> Hey can you add the % rank thing as a filter to ddnet.tw so I can see on what maps I can improve best?
11:31 < bridge> <learath2> I've always used xbox controllers on my pc. I've always found it more comfy
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://tenor.com/view/ni%C3%B1o-asustado-huh-what-meme-stare-gif-16752413
11:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> you are one of them
11:32 < bridge> <learath2> Seriously. The asymmetric placement of the analog sticks look janky, but it just feels correct in the hand üòÑ
11:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> it never felt good for me xd
11:32 < bridge> <learath2> I haven't even had an xbox like ever until last year
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> does the xbox controller also have the pressure thing?
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> on l2 and r2
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> its smth dualsense has new
11:33 < bridge> <learath2> I mean if you tried it without prejudice and didn't like it, then nothing I can say
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> its epic for some games
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> resistance*
11:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> idk the name
11:33 < bridge> <learath2> No it doesn't. Are there even pc games that use that?
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
11:34 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1203649717800800296/image.png?ex=65d1dd27&is=65bf6827&hm=476675ff1274a55a0ed0eb66820eb52c07eb5bde238b68e374b5c7d8b74e3029&

11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> it supports it when the game natively supports dualsense controllers
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> steam tells u
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> im playing persona 3 and it supports dualsense
11:35 < bridge> <ryozuki> altho its a simple game so no features used xd
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 wanna know smth curious
11:37 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1203650562172657684/image.png?ex=65d1ddf0&is=65bf68f0&hm=abee509b40f91018a5b93aea494720a8c3b1f0e379a7616557b904e9bfea6a43&

11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> oh u can update the firmware
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> sad i dont have winshit
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/how-to-update-dualsense-firmware-on-linux/
11:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> lol
11:39 < bridge> <learath2> New project time. Reverse engineer and port the updater
11:41 < bridge> <learath2> Or a different project. Touch grass and find a friend with a ps5
11:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
12:02 < bridge> <kekomonter> :poggers2:
12:02 < bridge> <learath2> Developer moment
12:03 < bridge> <milkeeycat> ok maybe not checked checkboxes in my pull request wasn't the problem üò¶
12:03 < bridge> <ChillerDragon> It was personal
12:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> yep
12:09 < bridge> <learath2> yep
12:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> yep
12:24 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 why is bottles not on gentoo overlay?
12:25 < bridge> <learath2> It should be available on some overlay
12:25 < bridge> <ryozuki> yea
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> i tried usinh flatpak for bottles for quick n dirty but
12:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> sandboxed shit, doesnt detect my controller
12:26 < bridge> <learath2> So just use an overlay and get it from there? Or steal the ebuild from an overlay and put it in your local repo
12:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> yea
12:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> will try later
12:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> i went to the outside world for a bit
12:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> where many windows users lie
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 ever used a iphone
12:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> my sister got a new phone and is giving me their iphone 11
12:30 < bridge> <learath2> I did, back in highschool
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> well thats long ago ig
12:31 < bridge> <learath2> They make decent phones, if only it wasn't a walled garden
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> i forgot ur age
12:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah
12:32 < bridge> <learath2> I remember it being fairly usable after you jailbreak
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> time to break the jail
12:32 < bridge> <learath2> Though recently I think there aren't any untethered jailbreaks around üò¶
12:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> whats untethered
12:33 < bridge> <robyt3> > An untethered jailbreak is a jailbreak wherein a user can reboot their device at will, and have their device start up with the jailbreak automatically applied without the assistance of a computer or a utility on the device.
12:33 < bridge> <learath2> You can reboot the device out in the wild. With a tethered jailbreak you need a computer when you restart to rejailbreak
12:34 < bridge> <robyt3> Anything else seems unusable unless you only use the jailbreak for playing around
12:34 < bridge> <learath2> I guess we did get a semi-tethered jailbreak too. An app on your phone that you had to launch to rejailbreak
12:35 < bridge> <learath2> Though that came with the annoying having to either have a apple developer certificate or having to resign the app every other month
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @ryozuki you are the one who added the doc comments for the CUIRect code right?
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its epic i just managed to vsplit thanks to it <:poggers2:1008007455936094328>
12:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> ye
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> was smoother than me trying to vsplit something in html for the first time
12:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2:
12:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://edgarluque.com/blog/ui-code-ddnet/ smh
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah ye that true i know it exists that would have been my fallback
12:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> :kek:
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but the comments in the code are so good already
12:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> true, its great
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I guess its time for server side rendering
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I will ditch html/css for server side generated tw screenshots
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> front end in C++ <:poggers:546812233867329556>
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @melo∆û i had to look up smh xd
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> meaning, "shaking my head", smh is typically used when something is obvious, plain old stupid, or disappointment.
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=smh
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> still dont get it xd
13:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> i rather translate it to "somehow" meaning, "how did you somehow miss this"
13:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> but yeah shaking my head fits aswell
13:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i have been reading it as "somehow" so far
13:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> same
13:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> and thats usually the context i use it in
13:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> smh
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> i use it for disapointment
13:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> like here

13:17 < bridge> <remakepower> I found after i run "sudo pacman -Syuu", my vscode become more green (Color Theme: Dark +).
13:17 < bridge> <remakepower> Are you got the same problem?
14:06 < bridge> <teero777> is the ddnet bind system touring complete?
14:25 < bridge> <teero777> lol
14:26 < bridge> <teero777> i just made bind files and ddnet segfaulted xDDD
14:26 < bridge> <learath2> It most certainly is not turing complete
14:26 < bridge> <teero777> ```python
14:26 < bridge> <teero777> for i in range(1000):
14:26 < bridge> <teero777>     with open(f'e{i}.bind', 'w') as file:
14:26 < bridge> <teero777>         file.write(f'echo {i}; exec e{i+1}.bind')
14:26 < bridge> <teero777> ```
14:27 < bridge> <teero777> executing e0.bind crashes the game
14:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> might be a stack overflow
14:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> although 1000 seems a little low
14:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe we have a large buffer in that function
14:27 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1203693355725496390/image.png?ex=65d205cb&is=65bf90cb&hm=c5fa6d2a5abc8241113990c106d0f1591f12c3aa4e107e6534ea9d91626a76a7&
14:28 < bridge> <teero777> 110 is a little random tbh
14:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> probably a stack overflow
14:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I suppose we could limit recursion to like 10 or so
14:29 < bridge> <teero777> very annoying limiter
14:29 < bridge> <teero777> i would suggest just not implementing it recursively if possible
14:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> practically, I don't think you need more than 10
14:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> on a theoretical level I agree with you. but it doesn't seem to be worth it to me
14:33 < bridge> <learath2> If you could branch on the value somehow it could be turing complete but I can't think of a way to do that üòÑ
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> i have noticed anothe bug
14:33 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1203694809181593700/image.png?ex=65d20726&is=65bf9226&hm=5acbdad5ef9d158ae7854766a6c942598cdeaf9fa093fe0695924843deee89ab&
14:34 < bridge> <teero777> also i think it would be cool to exec every line of the bind after 1 tick. so the game doesnt hang or lang on executing large binds
14:34 < bridge> <teero777> and it would allow for cool matchups
14:35 < bridge> <learath2> Looks like some flavor of memory corruption. Try with asan should be a free bugfix
14:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> would allow delayed binds which would enable input delaying which we don't want to allow
14:35 < bridge> <teero777> this would also fix the recursion bug since it would queue the binds
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> what kind of input delaying?
14:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> fire after 50 ticks
14:36 < bridge> <learath2> ^^
14:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> we don't want that
14:36 < bridge> <teero777> you cant do +fire or anything in bind files?
14:36 < bridge> <learath2> You can, but it'll happen instantly when you press a button
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> lemme try
14:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> anyway. bind delaying is something we'll likely never support
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> why is that bad?
14:37 < bridge> <learath2> if every exec happened after a tick, you could spam 50 execs to get 50 ticks of delay
14:37 < bridge> <teero777> yes.
14:37 < bridge> <heinrich5991> because it's an input we don't want to support. we don't want to automate players away
14:38 < bridge> <teero777> you still cant do +right, +left or +hook or look in any kind of direction? how would just firing be useful? maybe for double rockets? but you still need to just jump perfectly and aim
14:39 < bridge> <learath2> I can't even imagine much of a legitimate use for it, so I'd guess whatever you want to do with it is what we don't want in the game üòÑ
14:39 < bridge> <teero777> making weaponswitches better
14:39 < bridge> <learath2> e.g. double rockets yes, with no recursion limit and the ability to get 1 tick delays, you can automate that away completely
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> how???? you cant even aim or jump automatically
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> if the jumpt isnt perfectly tuned to the tick it fires it wont work
14:40 < bridge> <teero777> if the jump isnt perfectly tuned to the tick it fires it wont work
14:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> anyway. we don't want to open that can of worms
14:40 < bridge> <heinrich5991> delayed binds aren't coming
14:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> rust
14:42 < bridge> <learath2> You should be able to jump in a bind file
14:43 < bridge> <teero777> you cant.
14:45 < bridge> <teero777> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1203697766371688479/2024-02-04_14-44-14.mp4?ex=65d209e7&is=65bf94e7&hm=01e26e9dbe48d262de7c0706963042b8a6560cfa17110dc5917f199262360ff1&
14:46 < bridge> <learath2> That's nice to see
14:49 < bridge> <learath2> But I bet you can do it by binding `exec file` to the mousewheel, having `file` bind `+jump` to the mousewheel, then just spam
14:50 < bridge> <teero777> doesnt work
14:52 < bridge> <teero777> as long as its in a file it doesnt get treated diffrently when bound to mouse or keybord
14:52 < bridge> <teero777> as long as its in a file it doesnt get treated diffrently when bound to mouse or keyboard
14:52 < bridge> <teero777> as long as its in a file it doesnt get treated differently when bound to mouse or keyboard
14:52 < bridge> <learath2> Actually binding +jump to mousewheeldown just straight up doesn't work
14:53 < bridge> <learath2> It probably needs an actual stroke with button down + button up
14:54 < bridge> <teero777> my suggestion is that binds that are chained like `echo "a"; echo "b"` are executed instantly while binds like 
14:54 < bridge> <teero777> ```
14:54 < bridge> <teero777> echo "a"
14:54 < bridge> <teero777> echo "b"
14:54 < bridge> <teero777> ```
14:54 < bridge> <teero777> are delayed by 1 tick each
14:54 < bridge> <learath2> Won't happen anyway, I was just theorycrafting
14:55 < bridge> <teero777> i had high hopes for a fellow aw member üòî
14:57 < bridge> <teero777> btw aimline is still bugged by 1 pixel

14:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> latest master code?
15:00 < bridge> <teero777> i reverted the commit that caused the last bug
15:00 < bridge> <teero777> lemme test
15:02 < bridge> <teero777> yes
15:02 < bridge> <teero777> ~~lemme test~~
15:02 < bridge> <teero777> ~~i reverted the commit that caused the last bug~~
15:03 < bridge> <teero777> its just off by 1 tw unit
15:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @furo321 ^
15:13 < bridge> <furo321> Eh, I have no clue what could be the issue this time. I can't reproduce the issue either.
15:21 < bridge> <heinrich5991> in rust, this would panic (abort?) as well
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> yeah no segfault
15:31 < bridge> <teero777> really?
15:31 < bridge> <teero777> if you go on x=15.00 on tutorial and hook straight up?
15:33 < bridge> <furo321> Ah, now it happens. It happens on older versions as well.
15:33 < bridge> <teero777> yea i thought so.
15:34 < bridge> <teero777> doesnt seem related to the new bug
15:34 < bridge> <teero777> doesnt seem related to the last bug
15:34 < bridge> <teero777> probably just the intersect line function that is off by 1
15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it's actually done via segfaults ^^
15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I think they started abort()ing from the segfault handler because people asked why rust code can segfault ^^
15:36 < bridge> <heinrich5991> via reliable segfaults
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the only important is that the hookline color is correct
15:52 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so if the ground would be lower it should be red
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u know what i mean
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> visually it might be wrong
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> drawing lines is also a "weird" task for the GPU
15:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> subpixels & stuff
15:55 < bridge> <teero777> kk. color is correct
16:16 < bridge> <uniformgeist> Not the same person, i wasnt even born in the 90s
17:04 < bridge> <stnwtr> Is it hard to make DDNet available for `winget`?

17:59 < bridge> <milkeeycat> average chillerbot enjoyer
18:16 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Hello all, i have so much input lag with new 18.0.3 version, related to 18.0 release. 
18:16 < bridge> <_wohoo_> I was rendering with OpenGL 2.0.0, now I'm forced to use OpenGL 3.0.0 (worst) or 3.3.0 (slight better).
18:16 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Vulkan not available on my laptop card. 
18:16 < bridge> <_wohoo_> How can I fallback to OpenGL 2.0.0? Thank you
18:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> windows?
18:44 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Yes
18:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what gpu do u have? you said laptop, is there a chance it has two gpus? like intel + nvidia?
19:08 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Correct, Intel + nvidia discrete
19:09 < bridge> <_wohoo_> With 18.0 it rendered with (custom) opengl 2.0.0
19:14 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and did u try opengl 1? does that lag too?
19:14 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Input lag increased using external display, because nvidia output routed through iGPU.
19:14 < bridge> <_wohoo_> I blame them enough for this design choice.
19:14 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Changing OpenGL version made it barely unplayable
19:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @_wohoo_ can you start the client press f1 and show the purple text to me?
19:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it says smth about gfx
19:17 < bridge> <_wohoo_> GPU Vendor NVIDIA
19:17 < bridge> <_wohoo_> GPU renderer GeForce 820M/PCIe/SSE2
19:17 < bridge> <_wohoo_> GPU version: 3.3.0 Nvidia 389.12
19:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats the problem then
19:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it uses your nvidia card instead of intel
19:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> can you look into your windows settings if you can force intel
19:17 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://i0.wp.com/pureinfotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/windows-10-select-gpu-preference-per-app.webp?resize=827%2C489&quality=78&strip=all&ssl=1
19:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it looks smth like this
19:20 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> or does it _only_ allow nvidia to be used here?
19:21 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Intel gpu go black screen after 1h playing.
19:21 < bridge> <_wohoo_> It started crashing some years ago, not first version of teeworlds or ddnet. 
19:21 < bridge> <_wohoo_> 
19:21 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Since command input still handled, i have to open another ddnet and blindly tape /swap etc...
19:21 < bridge> <_wohoo_> ü§£
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway:
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1. i don't see the difference between opengl 2 & 3, but you can do `gfx_gl_major 2; gfx_gl_minor 0` to have opengl 2.0
19:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 2. opengl 1.x should then probably also work? XD
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway:
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 1. i don't see the difference between opengl 2 & 3, but you can do `gfx_gl_major 2; gfx_gl_minor 0` + restart to have opengl 2.0
19:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 2. opengl 1.x should then probably also work? XD
19:22 < bridge> <_wohoo_> I will test again forcing opengl version
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i am surprised your nvidia card doesnt support vulkan tho.
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it should
19:26 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Ok nice.
19:26 < bridge> <_wohoo_> It created again Custom opengl 2.0.0
19:26 < bridge> <_wohoo_> I configured nvidia panel control with hardcoded path and missed new download release
19:27 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Testing vulkan on igpu
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the igpu might not support vulkan
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nvidia cards are usually better at such support
19:27 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Ok, not work.
19:27 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Neither discrete
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh weird
19:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think chairn has an even older nvidia card
19:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and 2.0.0 does not lag?
19:28 < bridge> <_wohoo_> No that's OK
19:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but f1 says still nvidia?
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> with opengl 2
19:29 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Red screen for vulkan
19:29 < bridge> <_wohoo_> No, now it says intel gpu
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> better red screen than blue screen üòè
19:29 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but then it confirms that nvidia card creates the input lag.
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:30 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but anyway, you can stay with opengl 2.0 i guess ^^
19:30 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Ok thank you, so moving to igpu solved.
19:30 < bridge> <_wohoo_> I hope i will not see black screen again.
19:30 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Thank you
19:33 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Another thing is about freezer indicator.
19:33 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Some updates ago it was forced snowflake instead of stars.
19:33 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Nobody noticed flickering with many tees frozen in group?
19:33 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Snowflakes are all synced
19:35 < bridge> <_wohoo_> Probably I have too much photosensitivity, üòÖ

21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> isnt the original api c
21:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> vulkan is already complicated
21:26 < bridge> <learath2> gamedev is like orthogonal to C

22:37 < bridge> <deen> @heinrich5991 is it intentional that the `servers` attribute has to be part of the `icon` in communities.json? I think one level more outside would make more sense.
