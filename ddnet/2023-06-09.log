03:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> my file stuff works on Linux too, nice
08:01 < Ewan> e
08:45 < ws-client> <Jupstar> fridays for rustians
08:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon222> oh jupsti woke
08:46 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon222> i just fixed last ryo c++ code snippet xd
08:47 < ws-client> <Jupstar> today we have to discuss `Rc`. Using Rc effectively also means using `RefCell`. Q: If we assume i can cleanly use Rc in one case (the lifetime _should_ exceed the lifetime of all users). What's your opinion on it?
08:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar> RefCell could be hidden inside the struct itself (so the functions basically always take &self)
08:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon222> ah ye msg merge kills hilite
08:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon222> lemme see
08:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar> that would make RefCell bit more secure.. But generally Rc means giving up on compiler
08:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar> we need !rustgang to ping all the rust fanboys here
08:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar> and Learath as the opposite 
08:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon222> @Jupstar names?
08:52 < ws-client> <Jupstar> heinrich, ryo, patiga, zwelf, learas
08:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> learas xd
08:53 <+bridge> <bencie> lerato
08:53 <+ChillerDragon> !add_ping_pong rustgang @heinrich5991 @Ryozuki @patiga @zwelf @Learath2 (opt out here: https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet-ircbot/blob/master/ping_pong.csv)
08:55 < ws-client> <Jupstar> lel
08:55 < ws-client> <Jupstar> zwelf and patiga have capital letter
08:55 <+bridge> <bencie> ¡rustgang hi :troll:
08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> soon !everyone
08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> i knew it 
08:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> idk how to fix without reping all xd
08:55 < ws-client> <Jupstar> manual edit
08:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> needs docker restart
08:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> and docker slow as f
08:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> mhh too bad
08:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> ok watever
08:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> using rc doesnt mean using refcell
08:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> chilbot downtime!
08:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> well obv i need to write to my data at some point
08:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rc alone works nice for copy structs
08:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar> its not read only
08:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rc is not reas only
08:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> read
08:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u should check the rust memory cheatsheet
08:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> !pig
08:58 < chillerbot1> pog
08:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> he bak
08:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> jupsti go test mass pinger cmd axaxax i no balls
08:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> did u fix the things?
08:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> yes
08:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet-ircbot/commit/add1cf105fafcf6d586e8438497ab0e6ede88d05
08:59 < ws-client> <Jupstar> good, then i can use it next friday when my next fridays for rust is planned
09:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> oke
09:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> get a job jupsti
09:00 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i think u dont understand how fridays for rust works
09:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> i think so too
09:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i strike work
09:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar> for a better future
09:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> activism
09:03 < ws-client> <Jupstar> !rust explain me, i dont get it, sry i am noob
09:03 < chillerbot1> @Ryozuki
09:03 <+ChillerDragon> ```edlang
09:03 <+ChillerDragon> struct Hello {
09:03 <+ChillerDragon>     x: i32,

09:04 <+ChillerDragon> }
09:04 <+ChillerDragon> ```
09:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> jupsit is edlang allowed on rust friday?
09:04 < ws-client> <Jupstar> yeah yeah
09:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> pog
09:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> u like webchat syntax highlight for edlang? xd
09:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar> if i'd have written a msg while u wrote the code, would i have destroyed it?
09:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> yes
09:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> xd
09:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon22> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1686294306.png
09:15 <+ChillerDragon> oh missed ur pinger @heinrich5991 wat went wrong w the py module and wat now? :c
09:15 <+ChillerDragon> okay now i red ur whole message i understand xd
10:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> chiller u know any good gui irc clients?
10:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> weeeeeechat seems cool but tui
10:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> I don’t love my terminal that much
10:59 <+bridge> <learath2> Love your terminal more
10:59 < Ryozuki> dude
10:59 < Ryozuki> use weechat
10:59 <+bridge> <learath2> I used to use hexchat before I got cool
10:59 < Ryozuki> hexchat is ugly
11:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> weeeeechat
11:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar> chiller literally writing one right now
11:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar> discord-irc
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye wat jupsti said
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> slide in jupsti discord dms for pw
11:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> assuming you need no other irc features than read write to this very channel xd
11:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but i gotta admit nothing beats weechat @Ewan 
11:08 <+bridge> <matodor> https://tenor.com/view/dies-from-cringe-meme-cringe-imagine-gif-23477312
11:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> Hmm
11:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: spaces are getting eate by IRC
11:21 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @Ewan Green I'm using kvirc
11:26 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which spaces?
11:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> heinrich gui enjoyer confirmed
11:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> http://kvirc.net/img/themes/savannah.png
11:28 <@heinrich5991> hmm
11:28 <@heinrich5991> apparently matterbridge ate the spaces?
11:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which
11:29 <@heinrich5991> in the lines following ```edlang
11:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> o yea i also noticed that
11:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean missing empty lines?
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah no that was my weechat i guess
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wait which spaces?
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah on discord they did not arrive?
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> seems like a discord issue to me
11:30 <@heinrich5991> well, quoting is hard on IRC ;)
11:30 <@heinrich5991> ah
11:30 <@heinrich5991> maybe
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://chat.zillyhuhn.com/
11:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> indentation looks good here
11:31 <@heinrich5991> that's not going through matterbridge
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1686303067.png
11:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> doesnt really matter since no madlad sends such code blocks from irc anyways
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> btw @heinrich5991 use github for irc quotes xd
11:32 <@heinrich5991> I don't like that you push it to a github repo btw
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh no
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> why
11:32 <@heinrich5991> it makes it hard to remove data
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its sent to discord!?
11:32 <@heinrich5991> e.g. if someone accidentally posts personal data
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it will never be removed
11:32 <@heinrich5991> we can remove it from discord
11:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its discord
11:33 <@heinrich5991> we can remove it from the public view at the very least
11:33 <@heinrich5991> and discord is also required to actually delete it
11:33 <@heinrich5991> by law, at least
11:33 <@heinrich5991> I see little reason for them not to do it, except maybe negligence
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if u delete before i pull it never gets added
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you delete after i add it gets removed in a commit
11:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you want git history wiped let me know
11:33 <@heinrich5991> I see
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yea im also shit scared
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> to leak something here
11:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> given my damaged crack brain and me postin here so much
11:34 <@heinrich5991> a good alternative would be to not have it inside a git repo
11:35 <@heinrich5991> at least not a public one
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i like git
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice to sync
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i just do git pull 
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for nice grepping
11:35 <@heinrich5991> you could do a private git repo
11:35 <@heinrich5991> then
11:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and public is nice for quote sharing
11:37 <@heinrich5991> yes, but you're also sharing the history like that
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you gotta tell me when u delete something
11:37 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i can adapt to your censorship
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> private repos are just such a pain
11:38 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and imo this chat is public
11:39 <@heinrich5991> the place in front of your house is also public
11:39 <@heinrich5991> it's still illegal to film it
11:39 <@heinrich5991> (in germany)
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i mean i get your concern but lets be realistic here
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how long is your delay to delete?
11:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i pushed 36 times
11:40 <@heinrich5991> ah, I see
11:40 <@heinrich5991> I thought you pushed automatically
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i do it manually
11:40 <@heinrich5991> then it's probably fine
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when i need to grep something
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if you notify me on delete there is a high chance it wont even ever be pushed
11:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if your deletion delay is so long everyone saw it already anyways
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> it will probably me who accidentally leaks something here first
11:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> be*
11:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> :brownbear:
11:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> weird emoji
11:44 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> looks hot

11:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> @Ewan Green was also on IRC
11:47 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can tell them there
11:47 <@heinrich5991> ah
11:47 <@heinrich5991> not anymore apparently
11:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar> pw is: chillerDragonIsTheCoolestxD1995
11:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> leak
11:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> jupsti let da poor soul in

11:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> if i get a lil more fat i can not leave my room anymore indeed
11:59 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> i doubt you will ever get fat
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> leak
11:59 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> only if u drink more beer
11:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sometimes i forgot half this channel knows how i look like
12:00 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> leak
12:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Tor_logo1.png
12:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar> this is chillerdragon

12:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> he is the onion browser
12:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> onion dragon
12:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> fixed image
12:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2> xd
12:13 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> lol
12:13 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> finally someone to rival yo mama
12:27 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Do I have to use VS code in order to run map_extract.cpp in Linux Mint?
12:27 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> or running the map_extract executable?
12:27 < ws-client> <Jupstar> wat
12:27 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xd
12:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
12:28 < ws-client> <Jupstar> the binary
12:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i like destroying things with my brain
12:28 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> - cellegen
12:29 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> that binary which is used to build the repo?
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ??
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you mean cmake?
12:29 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> lib
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wot
12:29 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> ok, I misread binary with "library"
12:29 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> xd
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what did you do
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you need to compile the cpp file if you want to run it
12:29 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or install the binary directly
12:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> im sure mint ships ddnet-tools in apt
12:30 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I wanted to ran map_extract in the terminal to see if it runs and it didn't
12:30 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> it is already built, I ran the steam version's map_extract executable
12:30 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> and it didn't recognize it, idk what library or software am I missing
12:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what does the error say?
12:31 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> No errors, it didn't run
12:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar> in linux it might run silently
12:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> how did you run it?
12:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar> without terminal
12:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> was the exit code 0?
12:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar> else maybe drag&drop is not supported in your window manager
12:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``echo $?`` after running
12:32 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I ran it as a non-executable, but it tries to open it with "Autorun promt"
12:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> run from terminal
12:32 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> and terminal doesn't open once I do that
12:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``chmod +x map_extract``
12:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``./map_extract (args)``
12:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> he destroyed his setup 😂 
12:32 < ws-client> <Jupstar> <:greenthing:623706333677617203> 
12:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar> lel
12:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``usage: ./map_extract map [directory]``
12:33 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I didn't do shit with my setup, this is how Linux Mint is then
12:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @ChillerDragon we are missing lot of icons
12:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which?
12:33 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> not again
12:33 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
12:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
12:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xD
12:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i kinda brought this channel to the edge with icons
12:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but which one u miss?
12:33 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i already changed my discord name
12:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar> why do i still ping tsfreddie @ChillerDragon 
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> because he tried to fake me
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and now is doomed for eternal suffering
12:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Lmao
12:34 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> ok
12:34 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> then i get to represent you
12:34 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I swear to god I didn't do shit with the libraries, this is an error I'm having with teeworlds files since the beginning. I cannot open a LAN server, cuz the executable doesn't run through the terminal, I cannot extract map files, cuz of the same issue
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> veri nice
12:34 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> fair deal
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez free chatbot
12:34 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> you don't have a choice any way
12:34 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> @tsfreddie is gay
12:34 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok slow. Did u compile yourself?
12:34 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cellegenrih does this ping u?
12:35 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Steam.... version....
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cellegenrih leak some screenshots of what you did
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and only use the terminal not the gui
12:35 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ok, u open a terminal in steam dir
12:35 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> can you recieve video?
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> glad u asked
12:35 < ws-client> <Jupstar> @cellegenrih type ls -l
12:35 < ws-client> <Jupstar> in that erminal
12:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ok i reworked once again my type inference, i just need to find a nice way to store it and use it, there is the edge case of how to handle integer literals
12:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yes leak all
12:36 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> How are you doing @ conversions
12:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i dont
12:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> matterbridge does
12:36 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> is it a discord api or something
12:36 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> oh matterbridge
12:36 <+bridge> <tsfreddie> i get it now
12:36 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Ye, what then, I see stuff

12:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> ddnet has it too, just rebuild
12:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar> probably VS buggy rn xD
12:40 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I see, do I have to manually fuck with every tool ddnet client has?
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> even linux mint looks better than default kde
12:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no

12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no website ever does that right?
12:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar > also for the clients already connected
12:48 <+bridge> <gerdoe> @heinrich5991 seems something is wrong with peer states after first player connects, server doesn't process `System(EnterGame)` because peer is not ready, but it would be ready if it sended this packet, wouldn't it?
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> check for updates and reload its dom
12:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar > it does
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> which
12:48 < ws-client> <Jupstar > with nodejs u can do this 
12:48 <+bridge> <gerdoe> yo jup and chiller
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can
12:48 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but no website does it
12:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar > ok i dunno which does tbh xD
12:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar > probs too annoying updating 2 million users xD

12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> literaly?
12:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> copy paste very literaly
12:52 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> both the tools and some maps are in the same directory

12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> show
12:55 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> screenshot

12:56 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1116682122414006334/image.png
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``for map in ./*.map; do ./map_extract "$map" .; done``
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> sorry xd
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this u want
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i cant write bash w out shellcheck
12:56 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk how map extract works
12:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what even is [directory] ?
12:56 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> ye now it works XD should've questioned that m
12:57 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> im dumbass too
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nono it fine
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> when someone sent u snippet u can expect it to work xd
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> my bad
12:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
12:57 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> did it produce some result u like?
12:57 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> probably it found the .map directory of all the ddnet maps
12:57 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> So not a Linux problem but User😬😬😬
12:58 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> It's still a problem for me tho
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> more of a mint problem
12:58 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I cannot use them directly off of the console
12:58 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I have to manually run them, no fun
12:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Normally u can drag and drop
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also stop steal ddnet textures
12:58 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Yeah....no
12:58 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I cannot.
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> drag and drop is slow anywaysd
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 1 line of bash does it for all
12:58 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> so is it working now or not?
12:59 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> DDNet released maps without a license, I think I can get away with it
12:59 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> <a:pepedespair:1106630400543035494>
12:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> what did u get?
12:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no license means
12:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> assume copyright
12:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> But why. Isn't that kde
12:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u go straight to jail admitting this
12:59 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> it is kde
12:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Have u disabled support for it or what xd
12:59 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> probably the explorer sucks ass
12:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> buy nautilus
12:59 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Dolphin
12:59 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> also does it work now!?
12:59 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I considered using it
13:00 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> now I will definitely
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> do you have the result u wanted?
13:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> U probably on Linux mint 1999
13:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Xd
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> !!!!!!!!!!!
13:00 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Well I have new png files generated on the same directory the maps are in, so yes it works now
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ok good
13:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @cellegenrih I'll later check when at home
13:00 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> However, I still have to solve the LAN server issue, where the client cannot run the executable
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> btw if u like stealing mapres
13:00 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> If it works for me it's skill issue
13:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u might like this

13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> oh no the scroll
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> idk where i got them from
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> some .7z files from 4chan

13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no heinrich and no ddnet
13:03 <+bridge> <gerdoe> chillertroll
13:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just street sources
13:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar  yesterday night i broke my head adding scroll to the code snippets so it wont scroll the chat but i rq
13:07 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Chiller, also about the mapres "stealing", I upload them to Teeskins under the proper author if described, otherwise whoever is responsible for the Assets can decide the Assets approval, it is under it's ToS. We don't own them, but the Author, however since DDNet uploads maps without licensing, that means that all of the Assets which contain the maps can be used to distribute, edit and share without the care of those Assets having their own lic
13:08 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> So I think I'm allowed to do it as long as those are released ddnet maps :justatest:
13:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i say nothing without my lawyer
13:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but thank for doing the good teeskin work @cellegenrih 
13:08 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Sure thing, good job will be done
13:09 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> (Also I must do it this way, so that I know what Assets have incorrect lisencing, same with skins from ddnet skin db :justatest: 💦 )
13:10 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Also thank you for the quick help regarding map extract
13:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ur welcome uwu

13:17 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Yep, however it's still weird, that I cannot quote an entire ID without the other client making it an emoji
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its heinrich long code snip
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1686309472.png
13:17 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this arrived on irc
13:18 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Ooooh, scrolling through ingame chat? would it be possible to have it as a separate window?
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and then the webchat enriched the : feelsgoodman :
13:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that's no discord client
13:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's what ChillerDragon has coded
13:18 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> :pepedead:
13:18 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm blind
13:18 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bru cellegen only uses emotes nobody else in this channel used ever
13:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar > ChillerDragon: when PWA support
13:19 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Also I was talking about this discord making it an emoji
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> wats PWA
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pay wall anarchy?
13:19 < ws-client> <Jupstar > install webpage as own App
13:19 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> \:pepedead:
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> isnt pwa working for every website?
13:19 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> 773232467658145822
13:19 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ty
13:19 < ws-client> <Jupstar > it must be supported
13:19 < ws-client> <Jupstar > over some manifest files
13:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> would u use it?
13:20 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> How many emotes can you store?
13:20 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i dunno, probably not xDDD
13:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @cellegenrih i dont really have limits
13:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its just a matter of how slow i want my page to load
13:20 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm convinced, chillerdiscord best discord
13:21 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> call it "chillercord"
13:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its called discord-irc xd
13:23 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar  i slowly feel you intentionally send me on side quests. First i build whole linux in js now whole discord. All that time gets sucked away from me coding 0.7 into ddnet xd
13:24 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> any update on 0.7?
13:24 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you can join 0.7 servers with my ddnet pr
13:24 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Nice nice
13:24 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> wow
13:24 <+bridge> <Robyt3> You did nothing wrong, that error seems to happen sometimes in the Windows CI since the last few days.
13:24 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> +5 servers

13:25 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> is there antiping in there
13:25 < ws-client> <Jupstar > ChillerDragon: oh no you can already join, u clearly need more side quests
13:25 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> chillerdragon
13:26 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> has there already been some investigation?
13:26 <+bridge> <Robyt3> no, I started seeing it at some point after the recent GitHub outage a few days ago
13:29 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> hmm, a good 900 people on Steam still play 0.7 at all time peaks
13:30 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> jesus christ, ddnet is like quadtruple of that
13:30 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> and only on Steam
13:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> +2000 linux mint users are 0.7 enjoyers
13:31 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I still prefer ddnet
13:31 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> for ultimate statistics, ddnet should ship the client only through steam :D (please dont, i still use the downloaded version xd)
13:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> All time peak
13:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> All time
13:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> in the past year, teeworlds had a peak of 60 playeres
13:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> in the past year, teeworlds had a peak of 70 playeres
13:31 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> in the past year, teeworlds had a peak of 70 players
13:31 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I mean, if it would happen, then no more old version compatibility fixed need to happen
13:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> true xd
13:32 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I mean, if it would happen, then no more old version compatibility fixes need to happen
13:32 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Let poor vanilla die. Oy gives a shit about it
13:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> Fix your font god damn 😩
13:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i should spam some bots on 0.7 to rig statistics
13:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> and its not even illegal
13:32 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Ye quite insane right now, game's popping off every year
13:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> u just have to mark them as bots chillerdragon
13:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ez
13:32 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 🤖 
13:32 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> add a few servers with 63/64 xdxd

13:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ty
13:33 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> 3k bots in disposal lol
13:33 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> omg no css class cant start with digits
13:34 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Imagine the same type of botting as on Lost Ark
13:34 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> 100k bots just filling up the servers, horrifying tbh
13:34 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> idk how Lost Ark even combats this, but it's insane still
13:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> why u are using css class chiller?
13:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for bg image
13:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> of ma emote div
13:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> for each emote individually?
13:35 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> oh god
13:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and i type it out manually
13:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
13:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> booo
13:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1686310543.png
13:35 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> peek development
13:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> BOOOOO
13:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> use the script
13:36 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I thought it would be more tbh
13:36 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> it's still acceptable imo
13:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> Lol
13:36 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> it's still acceptable imo (I saw worse, it's not for looping shenanigans)
13:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> U can like
13:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> Use sass or something to use a base64 object property as a bg image
13:37 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> Chiller, can't you store them in an array and call them that way? See if you can call them through that?
13:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> 😵‍💫
13:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> Should need no array
13:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> If done correctly
13:38 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> still better, than manually enuming all of tthis
13:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> Also there is no “calling” or enum in css
13:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2222> i have yet to discover css arrays
13:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> Yes or just access emote path + emote name + png
13:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> They aren’t real
13:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon2222> like birds
13:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> No birds are real
13:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> Css arrays aren’t
13:39 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> I thought about saying that, but the way this method looks ain't it
13:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> Wha
13:40 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> what chiller uses method is like, hardcoded stuff
13:40 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> probably a reason why you do smth like this
13:41 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> probably a reason why you do smth like this is because it is hardcoded, or it works better
13:41 <+bridge> <Ewan> Just Don’t use css for style property in this situation
13:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> works for now i dont plan to add all emotes anyways
13:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just those used in this channel which is basically just <:justatest:572499997178986510> <:pepeH:462735917006848020> and 😂 
13:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> You are torturing urself doing this bro
13:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> May you receive a strongly worded pull request
13:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its more fun than debugging 0.7 map download for ddnet client
13:43 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye feel free to insult me in a pr

14:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar > wtf
14:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar > their website is literally stolen from 1995 xD
14:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar > and i have never seen a more german translated webpage in my life
14:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar > "Spiegelserver" "WWW-Spiegel"
14:01 < ws-client> <Jupstar > LMAO
14:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> looks like i'm building from sauce
14:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> agh
14:04 < ws-client> <Jupstar > @Ewan u can download from their github page xd
14:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> i did

14:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar > slow computer
14:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar > buy 2023 hardware
14:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar > :^)
14:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> i don't got the bucks
14:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> i got 9th gen i5
14:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> i have to wrestle with it
14:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar > how expensive was it
14:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> $280 usd for cpu/mobo/ram
14:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar > USA is so cheap xd
14:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> maybe 18mos ago
14:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol this was all B tier hardware
14:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar > mh ok
14:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> ram is slow, motherboard is weird bastard board with crappy chipset and nonstandard stuff like serial port and different tpm port
14:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar > then not sure xd
14:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> and cpu without graphics
14:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> why would pc hardware be cheaper in the usa
14:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> i only got such a deal because i bought it from a friend
14:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar > collect returnable bottles and buy new pc 😂 
14:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> we don't do that
14:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> only california
14:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> and they give u cents
14:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i dunno if its that cheap if its used hardware tbh
14:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar > thought u bought new
14:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> u buy low end ryzen apu & motherboard for that price
14:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> ram not included
14:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i guess i could buy a better pc for cheaper over ebay in europe xd
14:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> 846/1122 obj atm
14:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea idk
14:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> dont have bucks for this rn
14:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> i get new pc when i make money
14:11 < ws-client> <Jupstar > nice, get 4090 directly 😂

14:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lol
14:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> thats nothing
14:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> i bet this is some stupid build system shenanigans
14:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i had compile errors at 7000/9000
14:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> on llvm
14:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> kek
14:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> nice?
14:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> im just trying to build irc client
14:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> idgaf
14:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> that looks like a bloated irc client
14:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> tho
14:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> so what
14:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> im no minimalist
14:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ill back away
14:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> xd
14:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> people seem angry today
14:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> sry
14:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> im conscious on borrowed sleep rn
14:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> i did a 2 hour nap and woke up again
14:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea this build system stuff sux lol
14:13 <+bridge> <Ewan> it warned me about some webview widgets i can't get ez on msys repos
14:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar > !rust no stay. tell me about how u solve problems elegantly in rust
14:13 < chillerbot1> @Ryozuki
14:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> instead of failing makefile generation
14:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> so now it bones me 15 mins into compilation process
14:14 < ws-client> <Jupstar > create new blogs
14:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> nice guys
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i wanna make rust blogs
14:14 < ws-client> <Jupstar > @Ewan what do u expect when compiling under windows xD
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but a mix of lazyness and work
14:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> huh?
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> delays it
14:14 <+bridge> <Ewan> what windows got to do with it
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lot
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> windows doesnt have standard find paths
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for libs
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and pkg config
14:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> u don't know my env
14:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> issue here is not windows
14:15 < ws-client> <Jupstar > compiling cpp under windows is,was and will always be a pain
14:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> issue is whoever wrote the cmake didn't make it error if it can't find a required lib
14:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh this irc is made with qt
14:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> qt shenanigans i guess
14:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's not
14:15 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's build system
14:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/AUTOMOC.html
14:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes
14:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> moc expects a header that doesn't exist
14:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> because cmake didn't error when it wasn't found
14:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> looking at the ebuild may help find clues idk
14:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/net-irc/kvirc/kvirc-5.2_pre20220629000000.ebuild
14:17 < ws-client> <Jupstar > bcs making cmake friendly windows sucks
14:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> i love ddnet ci fail
14:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> i get FOUR EMAILS because it failed on my fork
14:17 < ws-client> <Jupstar > windows
14:17 < ws-client> <Jupstar > xd
14:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> github loves spamming tho
14:17 <+bridge> <Ewan> what are u talking about
14:18 <+bridge> <Ewan> it is completely not relevantthat it's windows
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it quite is in that it shows cmake build options
14:18 < ws-client> <Jupstar > its funny that u a windows fanboy. ez to trigger xD
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and it uses qt
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u lied

14:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> meh its not worth it
14:19 <+bridge> <ryozuki> just keep trying to fix it
14:19 <+bridge> <Ewan> i wanna know what u think u are saying
14:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im just pointing out, when i said the irc client uses qt, u said no, but it indeed does
14:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and automoc indeed does have to do with qt
14:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> i didn't say that what
14:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> i said the issue was not qt related, not that it doesn't use qt
14:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ok
14:20 <+bridge> <Ewan> xd
14:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> Jupstar, please tone it down
14:20 <+bridge> <ryozuki> jupstar? xd
14:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > <Jupstar > its funny that u a windows fanboy. ez to trigger xD
14:20 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this is uncalled for
14:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> he is right but
14:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's more that the issue is unrelated to windows and he';s insinuating windows is the issue
14:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> but yea my bad for being a windows fanboy
14:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> and not shitting on it when it's not at fault
14:21 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i mean its a real thing that building on linux is way easier
14:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Stop being provocative pls
14:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea this is true
14:21 <+bridge> <Ewan> but my env is good and fine
14:22 <+bridge> <Ewan> because it emulates the linnicks
14:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well something seems to fail
14:22 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I will moderate this chat. even if that moderation is considered provocative
14:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so u cant rule it out completly

14:22 < ws-client> <Jupstar > well ofc i would not say i dont like your moderation, have u ever meet a person saying that?
14:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> was about to say smth but i dont wanna get banned

14:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i guess this is cmake failing at thinking it found qt
14:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but not checking components
14:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or smth
14:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk
14:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this maybe is a problem with who made the cmakefile
14:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> it is
14:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> it warned at me that it wasn't there but i chocked it down to negligence or old cmake, doing stuff like doing NAMESPACE instead of NAMESPACE::LIB
14:24 <+bridge> <Ewan> it warned instead of erroring
14:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> xd
14:25 <+bridge> <Ewan> hard to keep up sometimes
14:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> im just elated to wait for this compile again
14:26 <+bridge> <learath2> Wtf is a qtwebengine
14:26 <+bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1116704922877050910/image.png
14:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> view web pages in Qt app
14:26 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's very expandible
14:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> chromium based
14:27 <+bridge> <Ewan> qtwebkit is the older cousin
14:27 <+bridge> <learath2> Aha, chromium based
14:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's basically building chromium
14:27 <+bridge> <learath2> Makes sense
14:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :monkaChrist:
14:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> wdym chromium wins
14:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> was about to ask smth about type inference
14:28 <+bridge> <learath2> I have 32G of ram, 8G of swap, I wonder if I should bump swap before I try this
14:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but then idk if it made sense
14:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or if the problem existed at all
14:28 <+bridge> <Ewan> type inference in what
14:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my lang
14:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> oic
14:29 <+bridge> <Ewan> u mean abstracter stuff
14:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i should learn hindley medley but i cant be bothered to learn symbols
14:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i should learn lambda calculus at some point xd
14:29 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so i just roll out my thing
14:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar > @learath2 im already impressed u have 32gb ram
14:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i'd have guessed u run nothing that uses more than 10mb
14:30 <+bridge> <learath2> Or should I maybe just get a flatpak hmm
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> now we know who flooded all the tw servers with bots
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its lerato with his 64 clients open
14:30 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> using 32gb ram
14:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar > he'd need 128gb RAM for that
14:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar > :/
14:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol
14:30 <+bridge> <learath2> You confuse my care for people that can't afford or don't want to buy good hardware with my own hardware
14:30 <+bridge> <Ewan> u could do headless client ez
14:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar > @learath2 ah that's really nice to hear
14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> truly selfless lerato
14:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar > welcome to the bright side
14:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar > welcome in the bright future
14:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> do i red bull or monster juice
14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> water
14:31 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and do push ups
14:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> i type while each keystroke takes 2 seconds to show on my screen
14:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar > yes, 100% water
14:31 <+bridge> <Ewan> cuz big compile
14:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> does ur cpu get to 89-C too
14:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> i have water as well
14:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> mine does
14:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> no it just sucks
14:32 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol
14:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i surrended in makign it cooler
14:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the 5800x is just hard to cool
14:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i have it under a noctua monster
14:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but well now its summer too
14:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 25C env
14:32 <+bridge> <cyberfighter> just put it in the fridge
14:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but well 89C on max load should be fine tm
14:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think i found my missing hyper 212 mounting hardware
14:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> i got rid of some shit yesterday
14:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> and found some stuff
14:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar > well it purposly goes to 90° doesnt it
14:33 < ws-client> <Jupstar > to give u every piece of perf it has
14:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> i gave like $100+ worth of brand new bike shit to a friend cuz it didn't fit my bike that i never ride anyway lol
14:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> kinda thinking i should have not
14:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> and done the zucc marketplace
14:33 <+bridge> <Ewan> but idrc
14:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea cpus killing themselves these days
14:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> well gpu too
14:34 < ws-client> <Jupstar > no
14:34 < ws-client> <Jupstar > they can run 90° 24/7
14:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> put a blower fan on it it'll be fine
14:34 <+bridge> <Ewan> meanwhile it's melting to death
14:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> dope we got another build error
14:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> ```

14:35 <+bridge> <Ewan> what is this perl nonsense
14:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> i just want to chat on the most basic f'ing chat protocol around
14:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> why u need 1100 translation units for that
14:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> im starting to agree ryo this is bloat
14:36 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> is there no build for windows?
14:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's old
14:36 <+bridge> <Ewan> 2019
14:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> idk how much it's changed since but i saw commits from 2 weeks ago
14:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> also even if the app doesn't change Qt versions are always coming out with improvements
14:37 <+bridge> <Ewan> so i'd want to build my own anyway
14:37 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye thats right jupstar
14:38 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the only problem is having a heater by ur side on summer
14:38 < ws-client> <Jupstar > 90° != 90°
14:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar > 90° on a tiny surface
14:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm on the 2019 version apparently
14:39 <+bridge> <gerdoe> should client send EnterGame packet two times instead of one?
14:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> with up-to-date qt though, probably
14:39 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i think vanilla does so @gerdoe 
14:39 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> huh? 😮
14:39 <+bridge> <Ewan> if u are on linux then almost certainly yes
14:39 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ddnet does so for some reason
14:40 < ws-client> <Jupstar > but i dunno why, but i remember it caused a bug before
14:40 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think it's supposed to send it once
14:40 <+bridge> <gerdoe> maybe it thinks rust server is vanilla one and emulates old behaviour?
14:40 < Ewan> kvirc
14:41 < Ewan> nice
14:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar > @Ewan btw their CI on github fails too
14:41 < Ewan> whose
14:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar > so it's maybe not surprising
14:41 < Ewan> upstream?
14:41 < ws-client> <Jupstar > yes
14:41 < Ewan> yea i knew
14:41 < Ewan> im getting second hand ci fail trauma
14:42 < Ewan> heinrich the thing about Qt apps on Linux is they always use shared libs
14:42 < Ewan> they are [lib]QtXy.whatever, X is major number y is component

14:43 < Ewan> so u can only ever have 1 Qt version per each major version
14:43 <+bridge> <gerdoe> ```
14:43 < ws-client> <Jupstar > qt dependencies often suck
14:43 < Ewan> not often, always
14:43 < ws-client> <Jupstar > xd
14:43 < Ewan> on Windows you have to ship dlls
14:43 < Ewan> tarnishes Qt practicality sometimes
14:43 <+bridge> <gerdoe> so server processed EnterGame once aaand client sends it one more time
14:43 < Ewan> really unfortunate
14:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> gonna try to ignore first packet, maybe it will work xd
14:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> is that dummy?
14:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> maybe dummy is broken somehow
14:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> dummy yup
14:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> have you tried non-dummy?
14:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> wait i'll plug another pc to local net
14:44 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can open two clients on the same compuer
14:44 < ws-client> <Jupstar > @Ewan that's one of the main reasons i have to join ryo in his rust quest. The ecosystem doesnt suck so hard. Ez to compile, ez to add deps etc :D
14:45 <+bridge> <gerdoe> simulating different ips xd
14:45 < Ewan> rust seems dope i just am not comfortable with it yet

14:46 < Ewan> your code blocks are killing the bridge... i can see why chiller doesn't like them
14:46 < ws-client> <Jupstar > sometimes xd
14:46 <+bridge> <gerdoe> okey ddnet client doesn't send it twice, anyway stuck on sending initial info though
14:47 <+bridge> <gerdoe> fake news xd
14:47 <+bridge> <gerdoe> dummy only
14:47 < Ewan> i hate it when apps have ugly icons so i can't pin them
14:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> æ
14:48 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds like a bug in dummy
14:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> how do u write lambda
14:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> on linux
14:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> æ€@ſßæð»
14:48 < Ewan> google and copy paste
14:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> meh
14:48 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> λ?
14:48 < Ewan> idk how u do raw unicodes in linux actually never had a tenkey on muh board for long
14:49 < Ewan> most des probably dont fw that
14:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> λx.λy.x+y
14:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye but how to type it
14:49 < Ewan> exactly idk
14:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ctrl-shift-u 3bb enter
14:49 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> I just switched my layout and typed it :kek:
14:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar > 𝛌
14:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 3bb
14:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> hmm
14:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> works for me
14:49 < ws-client> <Jupstar > 𝞴
14:49 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> λ
14:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> λ
14:50 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh now
14:50 <+bridge> <gerdoe> xd
14:50 <+bridge> <ryozuki> λ
14:50 < Ewan> so many
14:50 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lambda calculus goes brr
14:50 < Ewan> are these all the same glyph
14:50 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> ג?
14:50 < ws-client> <Jupstar > no 𝜆
14:50 <+bridge> <gerdoe> anyway any reason why client can stuck on sending initial info?
14:50 < ws-client> <Jupstar > debug it
14:50 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> They practically look the same
14:51 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> Similar names of the letters too
14:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar > dummy code is ____insert evil words____
14:51 < Ewan> e
14:51 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> Wait what am I even doing in this channel
14:51 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> I'm not a dev lol
14:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar > you are
14:51 < ws-client> <Jupstar > you develop the future
14:51 < Ewan> yeah GTFO srsly... u don't even have 10 PR yet
14:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xD
14:52 < Ewan> kids these days
14:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ewan ur msg was deleted on irc
14:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
14:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but well i guess u should tone it down xd
14:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> i don't want to accuse anyone of being tonedeaf but
14:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> that was a joke
14:52 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> I know a bit of C# but not nearly enough to hold the title of a dev
14:53 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> I can make some basic console apps but not much more than than
14:53 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> I can make some basic console apps but not much more than that
14:53 <+bridge> <gerdoe> check out teesharp :troll:
14:53 < Ewan> talk to me when u get a degree and 20 years field experience
14:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sounds good enough. when are you starting as a fulltime ddnet dev?
14:53 < ws-client> <Jupstar > c# are good devs
14:53 <+bridge> <gerdoe> matodor supremacy 🙏
14:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im forced to use c# to mod final fantas y14
14:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> otherwise i wouldnt touch it
14:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im forced to use c# to mod final fantasy 14
14:53 < Ewan> C# is good 
14:53 < ws-client> <Jupstar > all GC languages are good
14:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar > and positive
14:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar > and happy
14:54 < Ewan> it's like Java if anyone cared about it
14:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and fast
14:54 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> I learned that one specifically because every single source I looked at said it's good for gamedev
14:54 < Ewan> yeah it's really good for game dev 
14:54 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> And well, I like videogames
14:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well they dont lie
14:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its good for gamedev simply because  lot of people use it for gamedev
14:54 < Ewan> the only reason it's so fit for it is cuz it's just what's in place
14:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> not because it inherently is good at it
14:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar > php is good for websites
14:54 < ws-client> <Jupstar > 😂 
14:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:54 < Ewan> php good for websites cuz ppl use php for websites
14:54 < Ewan> :brain:
14:54 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> Haven't really gotten the chance to make any games worth playing though
14:55 < Ewan> what r u using
14:55 < Ewan> if ur doing only .NET stuff u may as well not use c#
14:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im making teecity
14:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well its half abandoned
14:55 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> I did attempt to make a knockoff of UNO in the console
14:55 < Ewan> the whole benefit of using C# for gamedev is the vast selection of frameworks
14:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cuz im making edlang now
14:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and tomorrow ill make smth else
14:55 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> It was sort of successful until I abandoned it
14:55 < Ewan> and even then Unity still makes it cpp in the end lol cpp best
14:56 < ws-client> <Jupstar > @National Insurance Clerk (Cyan) wow, c# and then a game in a console. What haxxor are u
14:56 <+bridge> <ryozuki> <a:Deadneko:823430684680781879>
14:56 < Ewan> he will be the author of the next oregon trail
14:56 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> What the hell
14:56 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> No it was just a text based UNO clone
14:56 < Ewan> he is doing 3d graphics via terminal
14:57 < Ewan> bisqwit has entered the chat
14:57 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> Nope
14:57 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> Not there yet
14:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar > wait until deen sees ur msg @Ewan 
14:57 < ws-client> <Jupstar > then u get the 3D cube
14:57 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> Also wait
14:57 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> What's a haxxor
14:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 does hindley milner handle the case well where u want a literal to give e.g the default i32 type to variables if no type is found otherwise?
14:57 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> Like, hacker?
14:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> ye
14:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> stupid leet speak
14:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I think that's not hindley milner
14:57 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in case u have a ambigous int literal
14:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but I have no clue
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ok i see
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i just want to know
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the name
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> of what rust uses
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for example
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or cpp
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:58 <+bridge> <ryozuki> or is just not a generic algo and everyone does their own
14:58 < Ewan> ngl i think the cpp approach is super naive
14:58 < Ewan> dunno about rust
14:59 < Ewan> but thatss just what i think from having used it, they probably spend many man hours implementing this amazing accurate performant type checking system only for idiots like me to say 'it just uses the first type it sees' 
15:00 < Ewan> but, such a thing would definitely have to be standard compliant so it should be defined in the standard
15:00 < Ewan> and if not it's the wild west i guess
15:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cpp is basic
15:01 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> nice @gerdoe what u working on
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rust type inference  is quite something
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     return a + b;
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> }
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> fn main() -> i32 {
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     let x = 2 + 3;
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     let y = add(x, 4);
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     return y;
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> }
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for example here
15:01 <+bridge> <gerdoe> messing around with server from libtw2
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> y gets its type from the return
15:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> then x should get it from the arg
15:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and give the types to the literals
15:02 < Ewan> i am a fan of this irc client but there are some things u definitely only notice as someone who has a lot of experience with Qt on windows lol
15:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> complex
15:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it would be easier if i made literals fully typed always
15:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hm
15:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> actually rust does that
15:02 < Ewan> like the Qt version is too old to pick up on some windows 11 styling hints and uses baked in Qt default icons because accessibility stuff can't be inferred on bundled releases
15:02 < Ewan> etc
15:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i guess this is why rust requires it
15:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that can be done using hindley milner
15:03 < Ewan> x gets it from which arg
15:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> haskell is doing hindley milner
15:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> plus some stuff to make defaults I guess
15:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> (rust is also doing hindley milner)
15:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> add function type
15:04 < Ewan> o so rs type inference looks ahead
15:04 < Ewan> that's nice
15:04 < Ewan> big :brain:
15:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> thats just normal
15:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cpp is behind
15:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hm what happend to 🧠 emote
15:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but the snippet is from edlang
15:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> which happens to look like rust
15:04 < Ewan> 90% of all the code i've ever written is cpp
15:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> by coincidence
15:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan how do you manage to break the 🧠 emote? xd
15:04 < Ewan> \:brain\:
15:04 < ws-client> <Jupstar > big🧠
15:04 < ws-client> <Jupstar > mh
15:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yeah, my problem with literals not having a known type
15:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for ints
15:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but rust gives it a known type
15:05 < Ewan> i send in irc with colons and discord turns it into emoji, comes back from discord as emoji
15:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 2 is i32
15:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> always
15:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar > @Ewan what is r job if i may ask boldly
15:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> let x:i64 = 2;
15:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is wrong right
15:05 < Ewan> r?
15:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> just do :b and tab and send unicode
15:05 < ws-client> <Jupstar > ur
15:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> no, that's correct
15:05 < Ewan> wdym my job
15:06 < Ewan> like i work
15:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i mean u a cpp dev?
15:06 < Ewan> :joy:
15:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hmm
15:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this trol
15:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> emotes are bridged no need to escape
15:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> is it still hindle milner
15:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ?
15:06 < Ewan> i dev cpp a lot but atm i am just hobbyist
15:06 < Ewan> trying to get job etc
15:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the part about defaulting to something maybe not
15:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but by default, I think Rust's int literals are of a generic int type
15:06 < Ewan> sometimes i get deja vu in this chat i feel like i have answered this b4
15:06 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> that can be any of {i,u}{8,16,32,64,128}
15:06 < ws-client> <Jupstar > oh defs
15:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i ask that once per day
15:07 < Ewan> xd
15:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar > to random person
15:07 < Ewan> i swear ryo asked my age like 3 times at this point
15:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> juspti always wondering how to get a job
15:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar > and which is it?
15:07 <+bridge> <MilkeeyCat> how old are you?
15:07 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> he only knows bveing in this chat 24/7
15:07 < Ewan> according to kvirc i'm 113
15:07 < ws-client> <Jupstar > ChillerDragon: ikr
15:07 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> Wait what is that
15:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> cs binding afaik
15:08 <+bridge> <National Insurance Clerk (Cyan)> My dumb ahh didn't notice it when you sent that
15:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar > chiller: fridays for rust
15:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar > as said
15:08 <+bridge> <gerdoe> https://github.com/Matodor/TeeSharp/tree/refactoring
15:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar > sadly the rustgang didnt join me
15:08 <+bridge> <gerdoe> u
15:08 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i alr watched 15mins of rust content on yt today
15:08 < Ewan> why u ask jup
15:08 < ws-client> <Jupstar > in my discussion
15:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> me
15:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what discussion?
15:09 < ws-client> <Jupstar > @Ewan i was just wondering how u get to 90%.. u either are a creative lone soul. or you have a job that uses it
15:09 < Ewan> the former
15:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 90% of what
15:09 < Ewan> crazy alias for lazy bum hobbyist tho
15:09 < ws-client> <Jupstar > imho it doest matter anyway
15:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar > u can be godlike hobby coder
15:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar > most professional coders i know are pretty bad xd
15:10 < Ewan> i have issues getting jobs because i don't have the work experience or years behind me rly
15:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> country?
15:10 < Ewan> companies see someone of my age and immediately say nah
15:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar > yeah yeah
15:10 < Ewan> usa
15:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar > industry sucks
15:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > <Jupstar > most professional coders i know are pretty bad xd
15:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye
15:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar > in usa u can at least shine with skill
15:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> mixed bag
15:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my coworker is rly good
15:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar > in germany u 100% fucked
15:10 < ws-client> <Jupstar > trust me bro xD
15:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> bro knows
15:11 < Ewan> yea i don't get exposed to a lot of professional code (code written by someone who was paid to do it)
15:11 < Ewan> they are normally like, if it works then IDGAF
15:11 < Ewan> but i like code as code too
15:11 < ws-client> <Jupstar > professional code 😂 
15:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my code is always pro
15:11 < Ewan> yea right i meant "professional code"
15:11 < ws-client> <Jupstar > all code i read professionally is complete bloat xD
15:11 <+bridge> <gerdoe> your code is always zooz
15:11 < Ewan> it has an inherent beauty in being fast and efficient and shit etc etc
15:11 < Ewan> but companies dont care
15:11 < Ewan> they want the website done in 3 weeks
15:12 < Ewan> i applied for a job at muse that i hope i have a shot at, it's pretty much asking for my skills exactly
15:13 < Ewan> cpp/qt and to know and be passionate bout the musics
15:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar > well if u really want a job (not saying u should, if u dont need it anyway). then simply tell them u show them
15:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar > tryhard 1 week
15:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar > and then they either see ur skill or they stupid af
15:13 < Ewan> yea maybe 
15:13 < Ewan> i am scared of making empty promises
15:13 < Ewan> seems like a bad move
15:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar > u wont see these ppl ever again
15:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar > in ur life
15:13 < ws-client> <Jupstar > so why u care xD
15:13 < Ewan> yeah true
15:14 < Ewan> i want a job pretty badly
15:14 < Ewan> but nothing bad is gonna happen if i don't get it
15:14 < Ewan> i just live with mom xd
15:14 < ws-client> <Jupstar > ez
15:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i still live with parents too xd
15:14 < Ewan> but the thing is i don't want to live with mom
15:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but im saving quite lot of money
15:14 <@heinrich5991> sounds like saving money
15:14 < ws-client> <Jupstar > i dont even get a flat
15:14 < ws-client> <Jupstar > as a lone person xD
15:14 < Ewan> yea maybe i could like stay and pitch in and put aside the rest of what i'd be spending with real rent
15:15 < Ewan> i'm okay with whatever as long as i'm not bumming
15:15 < Ewan> rent here is nuts anyway
15:15 < ws-client> <Jupstar > in germany the living conditions are getting out of control
15:15 < ws-client> <Jupstar > 400k for a small shitty house outside of city
15:15 < Ewan> yeah you just have a lot less to work with there
15:16 < Ewan> dad sold our 4 bed 2 story house for $260k last year, in a suburb neighboring the most expensive city to live in in the USA
15:16 < Ewan> actually that sounds wrong, maybe idk what im talking about

16:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nice
16:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> not quite but still good
16:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i pay for 600
16:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> i'd take 600 both ways over this crap any day
16:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> xfinity just does not offer symmetrical plans to households
16:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im sure i pay less than u still
16:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> only businesses
16:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 40€ or so
16:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> pretty good
16:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> less than me for sure
16:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> here u can get 300 down for Free
16:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> actually i dont pay it
16:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's a government thing
16:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> at  least if i'd pay normal prices
16:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my parents do xd
16:02 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> de fak
16:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's to do with covid
16:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> poor ppl need internet for remote work and school
16:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i can get gbps internet in a bar
16:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> fiber is everywhere
16:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 5g wifi
16:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fiber, what is that? i only know DSL
16:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> government doesn't require a certain speed afaik 300 is just the base plan that xfinity offers
16:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> beep
16:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
16:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Ewan Green but do u have fiber or cable?
16:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> fiber
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> ok nice
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then weird they thought: lets make upload suck hard
16:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> average user is not uploading shit
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to troll our customers
16:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> they stream tv and stuff
16:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> instagram images also use lot of bandwidth 😂
16:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea it's all consumption
16:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> it is a smarter move because they can allocate resources they'd use for upload to more download capability
16:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> it is just annoying for hobbyists
16:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I thought it's all video streaming
16:05 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> the bandwidth
16:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> who host at home
16:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> λg.(λx.g (x x)) (λx.g (x x))
16:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea video whatever
16:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> same stuff
16:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> Downloading
16:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> to iterate is human
16:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> to recurse divine
16:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
16:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> use vectors ez
16:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Ryozuki: λ
16:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Me: [&](int a) {}
16:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
16:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> we are different
16:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> same
16:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> thats what i think of lambda
16:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in case u dont know, this is how recursion is defined in lambda, found by haskell. c
16:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Haskell something
16:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> forgot the name
16:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry
16:07 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> can you tell me whether . or function application binds stronger?
16:08 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I'm trying to parse that term
16:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> <expression> := <name> | <function> | <application>
16:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> <function> := λ <name>.<expression>
16:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> <application> := <expression><expression>
16:08 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this doesn't answer my question
16:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hmm
16:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> where u learn this niche math bullshit?
16:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> i just code for monkey brain video game
16:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> and dekstop app
16:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i just learnt it today
16:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> reading a bit from https://personal.utdallas.edu/~gupta/courses/apl/lambda.pdf
16:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think its left to right
16:09 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> is `(λa.b c)` = `(λa.b) c` or = `λa.(b c)`
16:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> hmm
16:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i would guess first
16:10 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I kinda need to know that to evaluate the term you wrote ^^
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it expands like this
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> Y := λg.(λx.g (x x)) (λx.g (x x))
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     Y g
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     (λh.(λx.h (x x)) (λx.h (x x))) g
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     (λx.g (x x)) (λx.g (x x))
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     g ((λx.g (x x)) (λx.g (x x)))
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki>     g (Y g)
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ```
16:11 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> meh, spoilers
16:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I wanted to understand the term
16:12 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ^^
16:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its still confusing to me anyway
16:12 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> math is such an art
16:13 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> art is such a math
16:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > Applications are assumed to be left associative: M N P may be written instead of ((M N) P).
16:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > The body of an abstraction extends as far right as possible: λx.M N means λx.(M N) and not (λx.M) N
16:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > A sequence of abstractions is contracted: λx.λy.λz.N is abbreviated as λxyz.N.[
16:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> > A sequence of abstractions is contracted: λx.λy.λz.N is abbreviated as λxyz.N
16:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991 does this answer
16:15 <+bridge> <ryozuki> (λa.b c) =  λa.(b c)
16:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> (                            a                          ) = a
16:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the think is
16:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> (λa.b c) = λa.b c
16:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> outermost parents are dropped
16:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> usually
16:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> in theory i thinm u dont need parents
16:16 <+bridge> <ryozuki> they just remove  reader ambiguity
16:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> everything is atoms
16:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if we can define atoms with a math model
16:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> everything is math
16:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no?
16:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well not everything is atoms
16:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what is light to you?
16:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
16:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
16:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> whats the truly smallest particle
16:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> a string xd
16:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess we dont know
16:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> @Patiga ever tried the angle backend of wgpu?
16:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that would maybe be our only hope out of opengl 1.x, since that's also what browsers use 😄
16:54 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> :justatest: my eyes
16:54 <+bridge> <cellegenrih> is this how it feels to reverse engineer?
16:58 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep
17:16 <+bridge> <gerdoe> wow teeworlds sends so much info
17:16 <+bridge> <gerdoe> tees are just idling but wtf
17:16 <+bridge> <gerdoe> 9kbps/16kbps
17:18 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes
17:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah, but well 50 ticks or 25 ticks
17:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it fastly adds up
17:23 <+bridge> <gerdoe> can client no send info its state is not changing?
17:23 <+bridge> <gerdoe> not*
17:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and when another clients drags that client? 😄
17:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but if u mean player info
17:24 <+bridge> <gerdoe> and? xd
17:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then yes
17:24 <+bridge> <gerdoe> i mean player input
17:24 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u mean bcs of the upload?
17:25 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i mean u could optimize the `totally nice pls dont ban me`-network code in a lot of places probably
17:25 <+bridge> <gerdoe> always thought its done by default kekw
17:26 <+bridge> <Avolicious> But tbh, the network side is not the bottleneck
17:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's true xd
17:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what's cloudflares current state about QUIC ddos protection?
17:27 <+bridge> <gerdoe> sure but it burns my eyes when i see ebpty cl_netobj_playerinput going around without any new info xd
17:27 <+bridge> <gerdoe> empty
17:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well so or so, u always have to assume the worst case
17:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> doesn't exist on normal plans
17:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's so sad
17:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and nothing specific for QUIC anyway
17:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> give it some years
17:27 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> webtransport might appear eventually
17:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> im old in some years
17:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> lmao opened some random cloudflare page.. 1st thought i got in their ddos protection, bcs the site looks exactly like that XD
17:28 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cloudflare-quic.com/
17:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> this is only talking about HTTP3 support though
17:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and not even to the backend
17:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> only user-cloudflare
17:29 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not cloudflare-backend
17:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i didnt read it, was just funny xd
17:30 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> ^^
17:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but do their pro plans already plan the https3 stuff? like is there a road map?
17:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i guess there is quite some interest in this isnt it
17:33 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I haven't seen anything like that
17:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> at the moment the 'reference' (single-threaded) implementation of my file loader thingamajig is done
17:46 <+bridge> <Ewan> i would like to know if anyone wants to review it to make sure it's wanted in the ddnet code & the way i'm doing it is correct, before i go making the async implementation & replacing the asset and skin loading systems with it
17:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> i would like to know if anyone wants to review it to make sure it's wanted in the ddnet code & the way i'm doing it is approved, before i go making the async implementation & replacing the asset and skin loading systems with it
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> with async u mean multi threaded right?
17:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> ye
17:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> wasnt aio broken in windows
17:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> what should be broken about it
17:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we should use io_uring
17:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> my thing is a bit higher level
17:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> idk i remember aio being disabled on windows
17:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> make new thread, read from disk on that thread, call back to main thread with file data
17:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> tho not implemented yet
17:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> i have just made a compatible interface & ref impl for it
17:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> anyway i submit draft, i think
17:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah just do it
17:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u can always close it if u feel uncomfortable
17:49 <+bridge> <Ewan> let the blood of the ci spill
18:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> ugh since i have a tater fork and i don't want to delete it i have to do branch shenanigans
18:19 <+bridge> <gerdoe> uhh windows must die
18:19 <+bridge> <gerdoe> libtw2 server works PERFECTLY on linux
18:19 <+bridge> <gerdoe> and refuses to work as it should on windows
18:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> order of packets?
18:22 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> sorry, I never tested it on windows
18:22 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it's just some platform differences
18:22 <+bridge> <gerdoe> i don't want to investigate it further truly
18:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> damn, supporting variable shadowing makes storing types harder
18:22 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i just wish i could have type inference and move to the fun stuff, codegen
18:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :fuckyousnail:
18:23 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> why's that?
18:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cuz on every let it should be like another "scope" for that type
18:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and i havent done that, i just considered scopes to be function bodies and branches
18:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> so i guess i gotta refactor
18:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for that variable type inference*
18:24 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its just idk how to map this cleanly with the ast
18:25 <+bridge> <ryozuki> without making ast ugly
18:27 <+bridge> <ryozuki> anyway i spent todays willingness to continue, next week more xd
18:28 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://fyrox.rs/blog/post/fyrox-game-engine-0-30/
18:29 <+bridge> <Chairn> which one?
18:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh its chairn backlog time
18:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yet another engine xd
18:31 <+bridge> <Chairn> almost worked 😄
18:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this guy been at it for long
18:31 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they currently popping up in mass
18:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it had another name before
18:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> RG3D
18:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> was the previous name
18:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgQXyCw3in4
18:34 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://www.youtube.com/@xCoolMrDimas
18:35 <+bridge> <gerdoe> latest one
18:35 <+bridge> <Chairn> looks like it cannot find windows function for files management ?
18:35 <+bridge> <gerdoe> God writes Haskell
18:35 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no

18:40 <+bridge> <Ewan> ready for critics
18:41 <+bridge> <Chairn> ```latex
18:41 <+bridge> <Chairn> \documentclass{article}
18:41 <+bridge> <Chairn>

18:41 <+bridge> <Chairn> ```
18:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> wtf 😄 u surely like documentation 😄
18:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> idk how straightforward the whole process is to... non-authors
18:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> so i just write
18:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> cant hurt
18:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> what's deen saying about aio
18:42 <+bridge> <Ewan> im uneducated
18:43 <+bridge> <Ewan> that would surely be more setup than this, no?
18:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, i just know heinrich implemented it once (?) and for whatever reason it did not work on windowsd
18:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> smth like that
18:44 <+bridge> <Ewan> well if it doesn't work on windows then no
18:45 <+bridge> <Chairn> almost 1k message today 😄
18:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> Lol
18:45 <+bridge> <Ewan> Big day for ddnet dev chat
18:45 <+bridge> <Chairn> link pls?
18:46 <+bridge> <Chairn> ah found next message 🙂
18:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> my criticism is this reminded me that cpp is ugly
18:47 <+bridge> <Ewan> xd
18:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well its probs a bug in our code
18:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why ISkinLoader
18:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why iphone
18:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why interface
18:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> ```
18:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> // This is not a 'real' interface, it doesn't interact with the kernel or extend IInterface.
18:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> // I just don't know which convention to use for an abstract class.
18:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> ```
18:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oop is devil
18:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> 😃
18:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> why an abstract class at all
18:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u just have 1 impl
18:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> cuz aysnc later
18:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> nah
18:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> use aio
18:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i dont think u need threads
18:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> i needed 2 impl because it's too big of a leap for me to do both async and batched/error checked/whatever at a time
18:48 <+bridge> <Ewan> zzzz
18:49 <+bridge> <Ewan> i never even heard of a ddnet aio until i dumped +668-14 loc into this
18:49 <+bridge> <Ewan> someone explain
18:49 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/base/system.h#LL438C12-L438C12
18:50 <+bridge> <ryozuki> we didnt use it yet because winsucks
18:50 <+bridge> <Ewan> looks like i can use this as a tool to make the async implementation
18:50 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the async impl is aio
18:50 <+bridge> <Ewan> not necessarily a reason to scratch the whole thang
18:50 <+bridge> <Ewan> ye
18:50 <+bridge> <Ewan> no thread needed
18:50 <+bridge> <Ewan> would be neat
18:50 <+bridge> <ryozuki> tbh looks ugly
18:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> like cpp
18:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> this would look so clean in rust
18:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> that's what i do
18:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> i make cpp
18:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> u dont want me doing stupid teeworlds shit trust me
18:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> nested file pointers
18:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> what
18:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> nested function pointers
18:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> the fuckin
18:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
18:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> ListDirectoryCallback(const char *Name, int IsDir, int, void *User) { /* ... */ }
18:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> m_pStorage->ListDirectory(IStorage::TYPE_ALL, "whatever", ListDirectoryCallback, whatever);
18:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> ```
18:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> this is ugliest
18:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> it does this in multiple levels in some places
18:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think that uglier than cpp
18:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cpp async
18:54 <+bridge> <Chairn> why do you need something that complicated? Looks like completely overkill imo
18:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in rust its so ez with tokio 😂
18:55 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 10 lines of code xdd
18:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> i write 'future-proof' code
18:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> sometimes it is overkill
18:56 <+bridge> <Ewan> we can thin it out if needed but it doesn't sound needed
18:57 <+bridge> <Chairn> what's the matchexpression purpose?
18:58 <+bridge> <Ewan> the way the thing works atm is it finds which files it should load & loads them opaquely to the caller
18:58 <+bridge> <Ewan> the regex can be used to avoid opening and reading files
18:58 <+bridge> <Ewan> instead of just discarding it in the file loaded callback
18:58 <+bridge> <Ewan> say for skins the match expression would be `"\\.[Pp][Nn][Gg]$")`
18:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> say for skins the match expression would be `"\\.[Pp][Nn][Gg]$"`
18:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> this would avoid loading non-png files so the caller can be relatively sure that their data is png when it's using the data provided by the file loaded callback
19:00 <+bridge> <Chairn> so you actually build recursively a list of all files?
19:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes
19:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> sort of
19:00 <+bridge> <Chairn> do we need that? we kinda know where skins are
19:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> recursion can be avoided
19:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> there's a flag for it
19:00 <+bridge> <Chairn> i thought loading only 64 skins is enough too
19:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> true
19:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and faster
19:00 <+bridge> <ryozuki> safer
19:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cooler
19:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> blazingly fast
19:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> fearless concurrency
19:01 <+bridge> <Chairn> but now there are also skins in server browser, so im kinda lost on the count of live skin in memory
19:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/252358080522747904/1116734476182098051/ez.png
19:01 <+bridge> <ryozuki> :gigachad:
19:01 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> hot af
19:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> skins impl would be this

19:02 <+bridge> <Ewan>         FileLoader.Load();
19:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> ```
19:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> lambdas
19:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> too modern
19:02 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rejected
19:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> skins impl would be this
19:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp

19:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> how many UB stuff can u get by using lambdas
19:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> they are std fn
19:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> can be real functions too
19:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i bet a lot of sstuff and care is needed
19:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> no possibility of UB if there are no captures
19:03 <+bridge> <ryozuki> said every cpp dev
19:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> modern c++ changes the signature of the lambda if there are captures, so they're not compatible with normal fn ptrs
19:03 <+bridge> <gerdoe> > (edited)
19:03 <+bridge> <gerdoe> you gonna make irc users cry :justatest:
19:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> do u see and captures xd
19:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> do u see any captures xd
19:03 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well callback driven approaches are common in cpp. i wouldnt overjudge this. there is no memory safety anyway 😄
19:04 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> except when u use static vars 😛
19:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> moot
19:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> will the callback end up in the main thread again?
19:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> or on a different thread?
19:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
19:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> void fn() {
19:05 <+bridge> <Ewan>   auto fn2= []{
19:05 <+bridge> <Ewan>     // do stuff with wtf
19:05 <+bridge> <Ewan>   };
19:05 <+bridge> <Ewan>   static int wtf;
19:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> }
19:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> ```
19:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> 
19:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> same as 
19:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
19:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> int wtf;
19:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> void fn2() {
19:06 <+bridge> <Ewan>   //do stuff with wtf
19:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> }
19:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> void fn() {
19:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> 
19:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> }
19:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> ```
19:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> ub-wise
19:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> difference is static var is inaccessible to neighboring functions
19:06 <+bridge> <Chairn> would be clearer imo
19:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i dontj trust cpp
19:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and u shouldnt
19:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> walking minefield
19:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> main thread, so u dont have to do atomics
19:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i dont agree with that directly
19:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i think lambdas are actually clean
19:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> they also are faster
19:07 <+bridge> <Chairn> but his lambdas are quite big, so it decreases readability
19:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> this is a test use case. they can be real functions in the actual thing. who cares
19:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> mh i see
19:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> the goal is to offload the disk access to another thread
19:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> that's it
19:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yep makes sense
19:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i didnt read the pr in detail, but it indeed looks huge 😄
19:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but i wont blame u
19:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> most ppl would use a lib
19:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> i have been adhd on it for the past few days
19:08 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> to hide the complexity
19:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
19:08 <+bridge> <Ewan> im not always a fan of simplicity in cases like this, it leaves vagueness
19:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> and i intend for this to be used sort of like a library anyway
19:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> offload your batch file loading to an existing chunk of code that does that precisely
19:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> just not external or anything
19:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> my ddnet CI emails

19:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> jfc
19:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> clang-format needs to be fixed though. my ide is kind of flaky with clang-format, theoretically it's formatting to compliant code when i hit save but i guess not
19:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> since that run is failing
19:11 <+bridge> <Chairn> @deen typo in your blog post
19:11 <+bridge> <Chairn> "seperated" --> "separated"
19:11 <+bridge> <Chairn> after point 4, it's kinda weird though 😄
19:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> xd
19:11 <+bridge> <Chairn> you can disable it
19:11 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea
19:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> i am complaining 'theraputically'
19:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> i hope it does not bother u
19:16 <+bridge> <Ewan> idk if u saw i responded to ur review chairn, pls resolve if my answer is satisfactory
19:17 <+bridge> <ryozuki> yes mr @Chairn please resolve ur issues or HR will come

19:50 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
19:50 <+bridge> <ryozuki> 😬
19:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 😬
19:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> you are either crazy lunatic like templeos or a weeb like dxvk

19:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> word
19:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Ewan Green thats why
19:51 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u need to pick a side!

19:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQSgNp_gLnM
19:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> average rust dev
19:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> fun fact
19:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> i think im already crazy
19:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think asahi lina uses a voice modulator
19:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> no shit
19:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
19:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> and its actually the asahi dev from spain
19:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i think its a 28yr old dude
19:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye
19:52 <+bridge> <ryozuki> bit creepy after i found out xd
19:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> found out?
19:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> i never found out
19:53 <+bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
19:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but got the vibe from second 1
19:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i read some comments
19:53 <+bridge> <Ewan> from day 1 i avoided youtube code stuff
19:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> tbh i only watched 10 secs of the vid
19:53 <+bridge> <Ewan> seemed wise
19:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but still nice setup and skills
19:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> cuz the voice is awful
19:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its kinda exhausting ye
19:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye i also dont watch code vids
19:53 <+bridge> <ryozuki> male vtuber chad
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> coding
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> make me a hacker-like vtuber model
19:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> !c god this voice pitch is soo fucking annoying i swear xD
19:54 < chillerbot1> ChillerDragon
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> time to become vtuber
19:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> really good rust pro
19:54 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but annoying af xD
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks he must have a rly low male voice or smth
19:54 <+bridge> <gerdoe> this one is also ready, made it a draft sometime ago, don't know why xd
19:54 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:54 <+bridge> <gerdoe> #6517
19:54 <+bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6517
19:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 40 years of crack and cigars pitched up to sound like 12yo girl
19:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xddd
19:55 <+bridge> <ryozuki> chiller on fire
19:55 <+bridge> <Voxel> listened to one second of her voice
19:55 <+bridge> <Voxel> i hate it already
19:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1686333393.png
19:56 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hotter than ms rust
19:56 <+bridge> <gerdoe> :justatest:
19:59 <+bridge> <Voxel> i hate vtubers
20:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > i hate vtubers
20:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Voxel that was uncalled for
20:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> Voxel hates everything
20:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> this is a safe space for weebs
20:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> and waifus
20:00 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> owo
20:02 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @gotroyb big weeb just look at his pfp
20:03 <+bridge> <Voxel> i cant argue with that.
20:03 <+bridge> <Voxel> i am thw definition of the angry artist
20:03 <+bridge> <Voxel> chiller you guys are bold to admit who you waifus are
20:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> he dislikes midjourney bcs its better than him
20:04 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> :lol:
20:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> :fire:
20:04 <+bridge> <Voxel> no its shit
20:05 <+bridge> <Voxel> people just TREAT it like its better
20:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> u the best
20:05 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but u always mad af 😂
20:05 <+bridge> <Voxel> arrow had me "clean up an image" for his map and it looked like dogwater
20:05 <+bridge> <Voxel> full of bugs and way too staticy
20:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
20:06 <+bridge> <Voxel> so i did a funny and completely traced it over with cleaner lineart and better colors and shapes
20:08 <+bridge> <Chairn> https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/144o1p1/linus_torvalds_creator_of_linux_does_not_mince/ 😄
20:08 <+bridge> <Chairn> he became quite soft, no?
20:09 <+bridge> <Voxel> actual chad
20:09 <+bridge> <Voxel> agree to disagree
20:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> raging 🐧 
20:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> woke linux brand
20:10 <+bridge> <Chairn> For instance : https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/6/495
20:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> > retroactively aborted
20:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yea thats the meme one that gets referenced everywhere
20:11 <+bridge> <Voxel> yeah linus is like, the gordon ramsay of coding LOL
20:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
20:11 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or the @Voxel of artists
20:11 <+bridge> <Voxel> i am not strict to artists
20:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> u always bully mr journey
20:12 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ur fellow artist
20:12 <+bridge> <Chairn> another one 😄 https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75
20:12 <+bridge> <Voxel> yes because i hate machine learning
20:12 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> machine learning isn't bad but how we use it is
20:13 <+bridge> <Voxel> companies are exploiting it so hard
20:14 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @Chairn thats how he kept the kernel stable hehe
20:14 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> if tools were developed for tools to assist creation it would be fine
20:14 <+bridge> <Voxel> unironically the only ML tools i would use are ones that support your artistic workflow, not take it over
20:14 <+bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> but they actually make ML to create the "creation" :/
20:14 <+bridge> <gerdoe> if company gonna abuse water would you hate water kekw
20:14 <+bridge> <Voxel> water bills:
20:14 <+bridge> <Voxel> oh yeah speaking of which my state's in a drought
20:15 <+bridge> <Voxel> so we cant water our lawns
20:15 <+bridge> <Chairn> LOL :poggers2: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/144lfc1/turned_chatgpt_into_the_ultimate_bro/
20:15 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> xd
20:18 <+bridge> <Voxel> oh yeah about the ai piece arrow sent me
20:18 <+bridge> <Voxel> im going to send it here so chiller can see
20:18 <+bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1115740623992000542/1115740901373911040/sakura_upscale.jpg
20:18 <+bridge> <Voxel> 
20:18 <+bridge> <Voxel> this is what he sent me
20:19 <+bridge> <Voxel> and he asked me to clean this up
20:19 <+bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1115740623992000542/1115818755214286899/arrow_sakura_small.png
20:19 <+bridge> <Voxel> 
20:19 <+bridge> <Voxel> so i gave him this back. completely traced over and redrawn
20:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hot tree
20:20 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> for tw mapres?
20:21 <+bridge> <Voxel> yeah
20:21 <+bridge> <Voxel> as a quad
20:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> its very detailed
20:21 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> has to made big in the map to be teeish
20:21 <+bridge> <Voxel> its what arrow wanted
20:25 <+bridge> <fokkonaut> hombre
20:33 <+bridge> <louis> oh interesting
20:33 <+bridge> <louis> ai generated quads incoming
20:45 <+bridge> <Voxel> if i see any ai generated quads i am going to fix them
20:45 <+bridge> <Voxel> no ai art in maps!!!!!!
20:46 <+bridge> <gerdoe> fully ai generated gores map are coming
20:46 <+bridge> <gerdoe> maps*
20:51 <+bridge> <Voxel> worst map
20:52 <+bridge> <Voxel> im gonna start calling it ificial intellegence at this point because it does not deserve to have the word "art" in it
20:54 <+bridge> <bencie> that's ii
20:54 <+bridge> <bencie> should be aificial intelligence then :troll:
20:55 <+bridge> <Voxel> thats just minus rt
20:56 <+bridge> <Voxel> or just "artificial intellegenceficial intellegence"
21:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> !c this is what i meant earlier with PWA btw
21:42 < chillerbot1> ChillerDragon
21:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1116814527745495051/image.png
21:42 <+bridge> <Voxel> ew is that chrome
21:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chromium
21:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the most future rich and fastest browser
21:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 🙂
21:42 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> fastest bloat software
21:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 🙂
21:43 <+bridge> <Voxel> is having all your info stolen also a feature
21:43 <+bridge> <Voxel> 🙂
21:43 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> chromium is more free than firefox
21:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> use waterfox
21:44 <+bridge> <Voxel> @ryozuki is this true
21:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> oh no
21:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> demon summoning
21:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> not rly
21:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> it is true
21:44 <+bridge> <gerdoe> gg
21:44 <+bridge> <ryozuki> jupstar has a weird sense for licenses
21:44 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> firefox enables ads by default on the default page
21:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> even on linux
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> AGPL is the one that guaranteres truly user freedom
21:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> also MPL 2.0 is less free than MIT
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> aim towards a agpl world
21:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> apache 2.0
21:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rust for example has mit
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no
21:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bcs its perfect
21:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> xd
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> rust has apache 2.0 + mit
21:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah ok
21:45 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> but they are similar
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> mit doesnt cover patent trolling
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> apache does
21:45 <+bridge> <ryozuki> well patent stuff
21:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> yeah patent sucks
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the mit + apache combo is nice
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> u offer others the mit license
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but contributors must abide by apache
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> for  patents stuff
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but agpl is the best
21:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> and more free than AGPL
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it coves all and offers freedom to users
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> nah
21:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> apgl is copy right renamed
21:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its basically playing the copyright game
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> sadly apache allows stuff such as NVVM to exist
21:46 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> its part of the problem
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> a propietary compiler off llvm
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> imagine the poking
21:46 <+bridge> <ryozuki> puking
21:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> good read https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.en.html
21:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> bad read
21:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> propaganda
21:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks actually stallman agrees with u, on a no copyright world being the best, but right now the only good way to ensure and fight  off the corpo is AGPL
21:47 <+bridge> <ryozuki> copyleft is awesome
21:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> tru freedom is being free from stupid laws/ideas of humans
21:47 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> that's real freedom
21:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> copyleft plays by their game against them
21:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its smart AF
21:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> copyleft is the leftovers of copyright
21:48 <+bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
21:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> no
21:48 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its a way to fight them in their playground

23:53 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions pick one
23:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I like this one, for example:
23:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> > Christopher Columbus' efforts to obtain support for his voyages were not hampered by belief in a flat Earth, but by valid worries that the East Indies were farther than he realized.[284] In fact, Columbus grossly underestimated the Earth's circumference because of two calculation errors.[285] The myth that Columbus proved the Earth was round was propagated by authors like Washington Irving in A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher 
23:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> I learned that incorrectly in school
