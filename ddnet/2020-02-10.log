07:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <d3fault> Send custom messages to people when they join the server: https://github.com/d3fault/ddnet/tree/onjoin-messages     --- rushed as fuck sloppy code dgaf
07:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tght> pro coder
07:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cha> wow ur ugly
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `'r_anal_get_function_atâ€™ was not declared in this scope`
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Someone wasn't thinking while naming their functions
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> radare2 is full of that
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you see r2ghidra?
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> radare2 ghidra and cutter make such a nice combo
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> r2ghidra? no
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I heard that ghidra is the much better disassembler
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's r2ghidra? some sort of brdige between r2 and ghidra?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It allows you to use ghidras decompiler in r2, so yes
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> uh nice
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm really loving r2 and cutter
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It might not be as fully featured as some of the other tools but it's very capable
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I like that its interface is much slimmer than all these other tools'
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> what r u guys using these tools for?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> reverse engineering
19:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm what stuff do you reverse engineere?
19:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Uhm im not sure if i should open a issue but there was something wrong with the server for sure
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/77
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> there were many Error sending data disconnects.
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> it is a known issue for sending votes but there were no vote changes so its something new
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> aaaaaaa
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its the votes
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yea
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> if players have bad connection packets often get dropped
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but they are vital
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so they get resent
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and that overloading the buffer
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no its not the votes
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/vB
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> thats how votes would look like in the logs
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon I like looking at teeworlds bots
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> oh nice
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sounds fun
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> do you have a specific process that you use? Do you diff against the unmodified base src?
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like to work backwards from strings
21:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. I know `--silent` is a string somewhere in the tw code, and what references that is the main function
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how to anti-re-protect against @Learath2 in 5 easy steps
21:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you remove all the strings, sure ðŸ˜›
21:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should store all strings encrypted, that should slow me down
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> To be even more annoying, encrypt them all with different keys
21:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> r2ghidra is sadly not good enough yet ðŸ˜¦
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in what way?
21:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you tried using ghidra's SLEIGH before btw?
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> haven't really used ghidra yet
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> r2ghidra is having trouble mapping the types between ghidras decompiler and r2
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 and what do you use these tools for or do you keep that secret o.O?
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 so itâ€™s mostly Windows executables that you look at? Any easy/interesting bots for me to start? I am kinda lazy but I would love to learn it a bit. Such a useful and interesting skill.
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> tried looking at some old games, nowadays doing ctf challenges, mostly
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also looked at teeworlds servers occasionally
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try some easy challenges first, maybe? I don't know how to start
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @ChillerDragon windows, linux, doesn't really matter much
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also wanted to reverse-engineer the aoc "binaries" with ghidra
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but didn't get around to that yet
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can grab crackme's from a lot of places they come in a lot of different difficulties
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There was that one teeworlds server with a hidden backdoor rcon password, you can try that
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon thats how votes look like in the log when they got added, yes
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Not when they get sent to the client
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://youtu.be/kx2xp7IQNSc This is a decent talk
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's also ironic that the NSA is giving a talk at blackhat ðŸ˜›
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's that?
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the talk
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Introduction to ghidra and the motivation behind how/why they made it
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> > There was that one teeworlds server with a hidden backdoor rcon password, you can try that
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2  
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> lol like a teeworlds ctf? Where?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut arenâ€™t they sent to the client after the server type changed and thus they get added?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> they get added (loaded from a config)
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and then sent to the clienzs
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Yes
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but also sent on connect
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> So the Crash I found was not on connect or vote
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it can also happen after connect ofc
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> When?
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> bad Internet -> more resends
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Hm
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because more drop
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> It was a bunch of people
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> see
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> that doesnt matter
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> So you assume itâ€™s the known Vize issue?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> when the buffer is full, which can happen with thousands of votes + resends etc, then also other people receiving packets like emote can drop
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I see
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Do votes get send multiple times?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (I guess, this is afaik about the networking)
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I thought only once
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, but they get resend if failed to send (vital)
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like any vital packet
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Idk anything about this stuff
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> So vital packets get resend until they get a ok response?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> That would mean a bunch of people play a while and all the time the votes failed to send and then something happend that caused to much traffic and all those players get a disconnect?
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> everybody can in this case
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> not only those who receive the packet i think
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> because there is traffic at all time, to every client
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This is a problem for rainbow in 0.7, which I couldnt find a solution for yet
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Because rainbow in 0.7 can not be handled in the snap anymore, instead is sent as a net object
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> (skin change)
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> increasing the buffer, which i did, is of course a solution, but it only increases the time until the buffer is full, so disconnects still happen, but a bit later mostly
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i had a player with 200+ ping on my server, and gave rainbow to myself only. This caused multiple people to disconnect (error sending data), not only him. But when there were only people with ~40 ping, it was possible to give rainbow to multiple people, as they do not have to get resent
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> -> not filling the buffer
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ah interesting
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Ok really all seems to be one issue
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Thatâ€™s why I asked before opening a GitHub issue ðŸ™‚ thanks for explaining and sharing your experience @fokkonaut
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> np
