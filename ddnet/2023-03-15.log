00:07 < bridge> <0108ben> I‚Äôm not sure where to ask this, but considering this channel is called developer I‚Äôll post it here.
00:07 < bridge> <0108ben> 
00:07 < bridge> <0108ben> For the creators of teeworlds, what gave you the idea of this game and if you could change anything about it now what would it be?
00:38 < bridge> <heinrich5991> generally, I think it's worth to keep issues open that happen to users, even if they're not caused directly by us
00:39 < bridge> <heinrich5991> if we decide that they're not reproducible enough, I'd close them though üôÇ
03:54 < bridge> <Voxel> wtf

03:54 < bridge> <Voxel> what's the point of this
03:55 < bridge> <Voxel> @matricks was this meant to be touched up on in the future

05:02 < bridge> <Ewan> it's an interface
05:02 < bridge> <Ewan> you inherit from it
05:02 < bridge> <Ewan> is the definition virtual?
05:36 < bridge> <Voxel> Devlog #2 for my Killfeed editing
05:36 < bridge> <Voxel> I made `CTeeRenderInfo m_VictimRenderInfo` a buffer of 4 items, and am now trying to make the client capable of rendering 4 victims at a time, if there are 4+ in a team.
05:36 < bridge> <Voxel> I'm at the part where everything needs to be validated, but this won't compile. What am I doing wrong?
05:36 < bridge> <Voxel> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1085421152782004294/image.png

05:43 < bridge> <Ewan> i guess we will never know if the definition is virtual
05:44 < bridge> <Voxel> whar
06:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The ctf.cpp controller returns non zero indicating a flag was involved in the kill
07:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You are wondering if mode special is always zero right? It‚Äôs not in ctfhttps://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/26d24ec061d44e6084b2d77a9b8a0a48e354eba6/src/game/server/gamemodes/ctf.cpp#L40-L64
07:00 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (@Voxel)
07:02 < bridge> <Voxel> No, I was confused by what Ewan meant by `i guess we will never know if the definition is virtual`
07:02 < bridge> <Voxel> oh i didnt read
07:03 < bridge> <Voxel> i literally have no idea i just saw some random code with a bunch of inputs and it just returns zero
07:05 < bridge> <chillerdragon> it is virtual so there are multiple implementations for every gamemode and in ctf it‚Äôs not just returning zero there
07:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> But ddnet broke controllers there you are stuck with the ddrace controller hehe
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> class ISomething : IObject {
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan>   virtual int doSomething(int input) { return 0; }
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> };
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> 
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> class CSomething : ISomething {
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan>   int doSomething(int input) override {
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan>   // stuff happens here
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan>   }
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> }
07:33 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
07:34 < bridge> <Ewan> ```cpp
07:34 < bridge> <Ewan> class ISomething : IObject {
07:34 < bridge> <Ewan>   virtual int doSomething(int input) { return 0; }
07:34 < bridge> <Ewan> };
07:34 < bridge> <Ewan> 
07:34 < bridge> <Ewan> class CSomething : ISomething {
07:34 < bridge> <Ewan>   int doSomething(int input) override {
07:34 < bridge> <Ewan>   // stuff happens here
07:34 < bridge> <Ewan>   }
07:34 < bridge> <Ewan> };
07:34 < bridge> <Ewan> ```
07:35 < bridge> <Ewan> interfaces are usually comprised solely of pure virtual members (e.g. `doSomething() = 0` instead of doSomething() { return 0; }`) but it sounds like something happened to make this not the case in ddnet's development history, based on what chillerdragon said

07:38 < bridge> <Ewan> oh another explanation which makes more sense after re-reading chillerdragon‚Äôs msgs is that the original method from the interface is pure virtual so the CTF implementation returns 0 so that it doesn‚Äôt fail to compile with undefined reference errors
07:41 < bridge> <Ewan> looked back at the screenshot and no üòµ‚Äçüí´
07:41 < bridge> <Ewan> really just no pure virtual in the interface
07:56 < bridge> <deen> Every issue should have the possibility to have a PR that can close it. If it's a dependency we use that broke something, can be fixed by updating dependency. Reproducibility shouldn't matter. For those graphics problems, there is a chance we could work around the issues instead of waiting for GPU manufacturers to fix their drivers

12:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> im dumb
12:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i forgor to put portage and /tmp on tmpfs xd
12:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> also tmpfs should make compilation faster maybe :o
13:01 < bridge> <Anime.pdf> Bro gotta learn some oop principles
13:15 < bridge> <Voxel> :oop:
13:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i also forgot to setup weekly trims on my ssd
13:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i ran it and it trimmed 275gb lol
13:23 < bridge> <Ryozuki> fstrim
14:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `m_VictimRenderInfo` is probably an array or a pointer? e.g. if it's an array, you need to index it first, like `m_VictimRenderInfo[1].m_CustomColoredSkin`
14:41 < bridge> <heinrich5991> also, please post code as code ^^
14:42 < bridge> <heinrich5991> you can use three backticks ``` to make it format like code
14:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```c++
14:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ```c++
14:43 < bridge> <heinrich5991> int main() {

20:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chrome v111 completely buggy xd
20:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> discord not working other stuff not working
20:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> paying whom tho?

20:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> probs not the affected users

20:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but in europe they never
20:25 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> nice discord working again
20:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its more and more common
20:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the new cpus are just that good xd
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> new server CPUs are also crazy though
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and also crazy priceier
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the server with that cpu is  ‚Ç¨ 84 month
20:26 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and has ddr5 too
20:26 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
20:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and i mean

20:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sus
20:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think its because the master servers are very slow rn
20:38 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and probs the http timeout isnt cancelled?
20:55 < bridge> <Learath2> It's hetzners bread and butter, they have been repurposing desktop hardware for almost a decade now üòÑ

21:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki> GPT-4 is the newest version of OpenAI‚Äôs flagship language model. It is:
21:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     significantly better at existing GPT-3 tasks (huge improvements across both standard NLP benchmarks1
21:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     & human exams like the SAT/GRE2
21:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     , and better instruction following and world knowledge)
21:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     capable of new tasks3
21:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     (enough math to do your taxes and beat Minerva!)
21:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     able to use 8x more context than ChatGPT (50 pages, 25k words of context means unlocks better AI-enabled coding4
21:20 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     by simply pasting docs, or better chat by pasting entire Wikipedia articles, or even comparing two articles)
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     safer to use (20-30% fewer hallucinations and unsafe content5
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     ) 
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> That alone would qualify it as a huge release, but GPT-4 is also OpenAI‚Äôs first multimodal model, being able to natively understand image input as well as text. This is orders of magnitude better than existing OCR and Image-to-Text (e.g. BLIP) solutions and has to be seen to be fully understood, but the capabilities that you must know include:
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     Converting a sketch of a website into code (screenshot, demo timestamp)
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     Fully describing a screenshot of a Discord app (demo timestamp)6
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     Summarizing images of a paper and answering questions about figures (screenshot)
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     Recognizing photos (fridge, kitchen), offering meal ideas (NYT article)
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki>     Explaining why an image is funny (ironing clothes, chicken nuggets, memes)
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ```
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Jupeyy_Keks this is a summary of gpt4 improvements over 3
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> :o
21:21 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the image thing is insane
21:21 < bridge> <DefaultO> its learnset has also be increased by like 100 million times
21:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> a image of a web can be turned into html code
21:22 < bridge> <DefaultO> and it was already huge
21:22 < bridge> <Ryozuki> XD
21:22 < bridge> <DefaultO> those are high hopes
21:22 < bridge> <DefaultO> i doubt it can

22:01 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> whats ur CPU? üòÑ
22:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> weak
22:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i got 14k
22:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> gentoo
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> gg wp
22:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i need to test more
22:02 < bridge> <Ohio‚Äôs El Yek Final Boss> It's almost always 12k but drops to 9k sometimes

22:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> not dm1
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> only time i get over 12k is using wayland and self compiled mesa drivers
22:02 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> else no chance for my CPU D:
22:02 < bridge> <Ohio‚Äôs El Yek Final Boss> I still had the browser and other programs open
22:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i have self compiler kernel with native  march
22:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> well everything is self compiled
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think i'll buy a ryzen x3d when they bit cheaper
22:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> there kernel literally has a option to enable zen3 opts
22:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> then maybe i also try gentoo
