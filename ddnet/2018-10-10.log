01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> are you prepared for 0.7?
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> what the bloody hell will be on 0.7
05:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> ESL launch for ddrace tournaments
05:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> kappa
07:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen @Learath2 ```Lessig Bjoern is vali's real name, he lives in Berlin, his main spoofing server provider is dotsi, his ddos website is kcddos.com, he had 7 spoofing servers from 3 different providers when i was working for him, but he only let me to use 1 for my personal things, because he was using the rest of servers for his customers. ``` https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/vie <message clipped>
09:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What good is that knowledge? This would never be enough proof for the police to care
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Brokecdx- Actually someone from ESL did contact me about that some time ago, but I said no
09:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> oh why so lol
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what would it be good for? more ddos attacks?
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> maybe this game could get more popular through esl
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> more support
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> idk
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The players of this game don't want it to become more popular, which is also why we're not on Steam even though we got greenlit
09:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> (well, one of the reasons)
09:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> I can't imagine none would like to have more players, servers been always empty when did ddnet had 64/64 full servers last time
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> a week or so ago there was a 64/64 Stronghold 2 ðŸ˜›
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> on Chile prob
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> GER
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> ah lol
09:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't really mind more players but more popular means more ddos anyways
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> better than let this game die out no
09:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> and maybe a solution comes by time
09:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> idk how to get new players anyways, our learning curve is so steep no one new really enjoys the game
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I enjoy the game ðŸ‘€
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Would say most of the players don't evne experience other mods like ddrace and gores
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Vanilla client doesnt show them by default
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> This is a niche game, u will love it or hate it
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> the other big reason is that we still dont have any proper tuto or anythign to help actual newcomers
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> +1
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> so unless they got dragged there by a friend they gonna have a rly hard time and prob leave
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> there should be a client implemented tutorial that starts a local server with dummies
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Actually we could have a nice tutorial if someone made the map
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Timakro already coded features to make a interactice tutorial
09:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Kinda
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> There is already was a map for training
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> I wasn't dragged in by a friend, but did not have much hard time anyway. TBH, the hardest thing was finding out how to switch weapons and how the fire hook :]
09:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> I wasn't dragged in by a friend, but did not have much hard time anyway. TBH, the hardest thing was finding out how to switch weapons and how to fire hook :]
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But still aol the players on ddnet learned without and tutorial so its also a matter of effort and willingness
09:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But still all the players on ddnet learned without and tutorial so its also a matter of effort and willingness
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Its also true that ddnet is a bad mod to get started into tw
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U better train hool on ctf first
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Hook*
09:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> yeah, ctf/dm -> zcatch -> ddrace is better IMO
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> yeah, ctf/dm -> zcatch -> ddrace is a good way to get started
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And openfng to train aim
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> With laser
09:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> And hammer hit
09:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> yeah, especially hammer hits
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> are there any statistics on how many players are downloading teeworlds on steam?
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> or ddnet
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ddnet is not on steal
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Steam
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> i meant ddnet seperate
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> ddnet and teeworlds
09:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> https://steamcharts.com/app/380840
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> its not downloads tho
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 500,000 .. 1,000,000owners
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/612 Tutorial
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> According to steamdb
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> 500k owners ðŸ‘€
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> tw new top 1 twitch game
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Owners mean download
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i know
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But not that they played
09:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but i think they re wrong
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I dont think its wrong
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Steam is rly big
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> dunno 500K-1M sounds like a pretty big gap
09:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> kinda shows they dont have any actual way to measure it xd
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Steam itself for sure jas
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Has
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ask the tw owner on steam
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> For stats
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Steam has in total 10-15 Million users
09:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> doubt 10% downloaded teeworlds
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I think steam has lot more than that
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> ye
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> 10 million is like concurrent users
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> https://www.statista.com/statistics/308330/number-stream-users/
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Concurrent
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Is not total
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U confuse things
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> There you have concurrent TW Steam players: https://steamcharts.com/app/380840
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> All time peak is ~900
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> there must be much more room than that lmao
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Not all ppl use steam for tw
09:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i wonder what part of these use ddnet client tho
09:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We have ~2500 unique IPs per day starting DDNet client
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> u get the ips of players that start a ddnet client? o.O
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah becuase of the masterserver flag thingy and news stuff?
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 1000 of them are ddnet trolls with their vps to survive kickvotes xd
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> vpn*
09:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Exactly, counting accesses to https://info.ddnet.tw/info
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Thats nice
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> We just have to figure out a proper marketing plan to reach more gamers
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> To get more ddos
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> There will be solutions
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I also want more players
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I dou t
09:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Doubt
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> There is always a solution
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Maybe if we had someone ricj
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Rich
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> Well
09:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> More players more support
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> And maybe more donations
09:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Well, i think more players would not be bad atm. Nowadays the servers are deserted.
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> There are no new novice maps
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> A kobra 5 would help
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :tee_thinking:
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD the only servers with players on are ddnet servers and sometimes ddnet++
11:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> And some noby fng
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and @heinrich5991, maybe you should untick `vanilla gametypes only` for default, in vanilla client
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Yes that should have been done since long time ago but oy doesnt want
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> It hides the most fun part of tw
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U get bored of ctf at 10 mins
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye xD
12:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> btw, can we have support to search for gametypes in the search bar? for me it feels better to search for everything in the line from the server in the search bar and not having an extra search bar on the Filter page for gametype.
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> am tracking the server info every 10 minutes and daily peak is always between 650 and 800
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> also on average 5.250 players with unique names each day
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 37.20% of the players were sighted on DDRace mod
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 27.59% on Block
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 10.85% on Gores
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 6.30% on CTF
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 5.77% on FNG
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 2.70% on iF|iCity
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 2.57% on infClassR
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> 1.67% DM
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> well were the stats from 27.09 to 06.10 where I finally deployed it to a server, didn't have a master server response cache so I can't properly collect data rn
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DaRealFreak> (47.87% no flag, 5.17% germany, 5.17% libya (aka Fake Clan from qshar servers polluting the data))
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Nice :3
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> when I refresh the server list my fps rate drops to 0 for some seconds, known issue?
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @NeXus on windows with console enabled I suppose
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and debug mode enabled
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also on linux
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª since a specific version or since forever?
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think since 1.4.x
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 11*
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> deen said the async tasks were removed
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs of a crash
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hmm, on windows we disabled stdout asyncio as it lead to an instant crash
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but it's been a while since we did that and it's windows only
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i know
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even in that case it only slowed down if debug is enabled
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i also only noticed the bug, since we found the bug that release mode wasnt active
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i tested 11.4.3 yesterday and it lagged to
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I meant debug mode as in the debug mode you enable with `debug 1` in local console
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah i dont use that
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i profiled it and only saw that sorting the server list kills everything probably
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dunno if that was async
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> or if its bcs of the ddos now
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> master srv
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, didn't change anything about sorting
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 for me since 11.4.4 without debug mode and without consoe
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 for me since 11.4.4 without debug mode and without console
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it freezes for 4 times at about 90% loading done
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats i added since master server ddos
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> is the request to master server in the main thread?
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and blocking xd
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen i cant get your solution to work (dont write broadcast to f1)
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen> lol cant we add a new master server protocol lmao kappa
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> well, it works here
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> lots of spaces  \n and then your text
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen can you give me an example using codeblock
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ```
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> well, this is definitely not working deen
19:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> either its not showing the broadcast but sending it to f1 or the package is too big and its not sending it at all
19:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 do you know a solution?
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @fokkonaut why should it work that way around
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It always lands in f1,\
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probs deen thought the other way around
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> remember the broadcast timer?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can we implement something like that?
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then we wouldnt have this spam
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> for example it can be used for the timer
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can't get it to work on older clients
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but newer ðŸ˜ƒ
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> thus some people will be spammed
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> thus it's pointless
19:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mh
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is it possible to edit a players score but that only one tee can see the change? for example if tee1 writes /score then tee2's score gets set to 5, but for tee2 its score is still 0?
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> could you tell me how?
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you need to modify the ::snap functions
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> probs the one in player.cpp
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> maybe in server.cpp
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i think player.cpp xd
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and what do i need to edit?
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well u get the ID of the snapping character
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ye
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so if ID==character id who gets the fake score, then send fake score
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> something like that
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> oh
20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and PlayerID() == Id of character whos score is faked
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> sec what
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if(PlayerID() == FakeScoreID && ID == CharacterWhoGetsFake)
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ID == SnappingClient?
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
20:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think that is the ID
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> be aware that this value can be -1
20:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> oh, thanks
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its probs ClientID() too
20:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> so PlayerID is whose id?
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> complicated
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its basically like this
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> a player request/snaps the current values of another player, so it goes thourgh all players and calls snap(MYID<-- the id of the player asking for the info)
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then u are in the player object, where u want the info from
20:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he has an id too
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and that can be called somehow xd
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> GetCID
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats the function in ddnet code
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i will have a look into it ðŸ˜ƒ
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro you should probably decode as utf-8 and if that fails, fall back to some other encoding
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> otherwise you'll break utf-8 encoded strings, which would be sad
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (strings in encodings other than utf-8 rarely parse as utf-8 if they're not just using ASCII, so you're relatively safe there)
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Dev what will happen if 0.7 really gets released?
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Will ddnet stay in 0.6? Is someone willing to port ddrace/ddnet to 0.7? Will modding even survive the 0.7?
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> probably it will be ported
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon wait for the release to actually happen I guess
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> if 0.7 get released, everyone will celebrate....
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i doubt it will be ported
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i am not sure @Bojidar Marinov
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still doubt 0.7 will get released
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 0.7 could harm tw if the community splits
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyone remember 0.6? t'was the same
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well oy said it agian^^ that it will be this weekend
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> wow
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i am here since 0.6.1 so im scared @heinrich5991 this is new for me
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and 0.6 didnt remove broadcast .-.
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> who uses broadcast anyway
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ....
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> ~~who uses broadcast anyway~~
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet++
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i am here since 0.5.0
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet tournamnets city mods etc
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> shouldn't we start already to have something running in 0.7 to run ddnet servers in 0.7 aswell
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> maybe even the same points database and the basic features
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon ddpp will die ðŸ˜¦
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ye i guess porting ddpp will be nearly impossible
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does 0.7 improve mod support
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its shit then
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 0.7 is agianst modding as far as i know
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bojidar Marinov> why :/
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is it possible to have a normal score (like 120) if the ddrace scoreboard thing is on (clientside)
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> like on fng, but without changing the gametype name
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Jupstar âœª ?
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think only if you disable it
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> in client
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> mhhhhh
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @fokkonaut it's client side "based" on normally, it checks if it's a ddrace server
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> if yeah then the score should be a timer
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @fokkonaut ah, the otherway around, just use cl_print_broadcasts 0
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> vanilla doesn't print broadcasts on console
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen i meant serverside xd
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but not possible?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I added it in the client intentionally so that you can look up what was broadcast
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 would you merge a pr so that the server can tell the client when to use the ddrace scoreboard and when not? so basically if the gametype is ddrace the client is using it and if its ctf its not. on the DDNet++ server we have different gamemodes in one, so chillerdragon and me would like to have an option to tell the client it has to use normal score now (for fng etc)
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> would you generally merge it or decline it?
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the option could also be used to merge BW and IsDDNet into one, but bw can send us not to use ddrace score. that was the only reason i made them seperate.
