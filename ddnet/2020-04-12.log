00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> can anyone tell me how the data of quadlayers is stored?
00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> im sorta stuck again and figured someone here might be able to speed this up
01:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm @Patiga what do you want to know?
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> in the map files each quadlayer points to a data_item (bytes array) for its content, and i dont understand how the content of the data item is constructed
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> constructed as in which bytes describe which values
01:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, it's just raw CQuads (not very portable now that I think about it)
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> oh i totally missed that one
01:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> how did anyone think this was a good idea? no serialization whatsoever
01:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> atleast the points are not floats, that definitely would have been a mess
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> thanks tho üëç
03:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> @heinrich5991 sorry for missing the message. It seems @Ryozuki  spotted the issue (#2134)
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Gotta set a CI to check built packages :wtf:
09:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> What are you working on btw @Patiga ?
10:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @ChillerDragon on a map parser :)
11:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Patiga cool! Will it support 0.7? And do you have any specific plans what should it be able to do?
11:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> im first going for 0.6 maps but 0.7 isnt too different i think so i do intend to follow up with that
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> nice
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> never looked into it but as far as i know 0.7 has new compression
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> otherwise im just going for a general sensible parse
11:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> r
11:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> no specific idea what it is? Is it a library? Or does it show stats about the map? Save it in a different format?
11:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ye its a library :)
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> for what language?
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> rust
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üëç
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Working on editor2 with lordsk is hardly fun
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll do a couple ddnet issues instead, anyone want anything?
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> add global-ban command
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd just make it info.ddnet.tw/bans.json üòõ
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> as long as it prevents mods from having to follow people from server to server * all 40 different ports then its good
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder if making it public is a good idea? maybe other servers can use it too
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes its
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> sharing bans is often a good thing if thats what u meant
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe semi public, like other large server hosters
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll go make some food, I'll try to give it a go after
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> sounds good
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye the ips could be hidden except for other hosters maybe
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh, or maybe just add it into dnsbl
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is that possible
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we already host our own dnsbl server, and we query it when someone joins
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ooo
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no extra check would be needed that way
15:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i had been wondering where ddnet dnsbl actually gets info from
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not public information
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we got it from the kog people, ask them if you want to know
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i think i know the api but i dont know how the dnsbl code requests from it
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we have a dns proxy that maps dns requests to https rest api requests
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> small python script
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oo
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is the script public
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and a little caching
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, because it contains the provider we use
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there wouldn't be much left of the script after we remove the relevant parts
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I thought it was just one function that calls the api?
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> was it? I never really touched it
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you wrote it and @jao added caching
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and whitelist support
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can censor the request
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I gtg for an hour or so, if either of you doesn't then I can strip it later
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you need to censor some names too
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> so that u dont know what we use
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> oh
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> well i know but i get u
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby https://gist.github.com/Learath2/221f5cea721bb510ff1faf5a0967f103
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> cool o_o
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> thx
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You'll just need to implement a checker with the function is_blocked
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i do have a form of anti vpn already i was just curious and maybe considering moving to the builtin dnsbl thing sometime
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @onby well you could integrate yours into dnsbl too
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yes i have the code from it already in my server cus its ddnet base
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i just didnt figure out how to use it lol
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki indentation is off (a tab and two spaces, should be four spaces) and I'd prefer naming it ddnet-antibot
17:08 <@deen> +1
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> done
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> done
21:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I'm having trouble tracking down who is setting a cmake variable, where do I look?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> @Learath2
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> U here?
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> How much points in all
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> Types
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> U understand or no?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> :tee_thinking:
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> :justatest:
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> @Learath2
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> How much points min and max in types?
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> Oh okay
21:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> :cammo:
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I might not be understanding you
21:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://ddnet.tw/ranks/ at the bottom you can see how we calculate points for a map
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> How much points in oldschool minimum and maximum and in dummy and solo @Learath2
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> U know or no?
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> check that page
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Crying> :cammo:
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know off the top of my head
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/698979945799614625/unknown.png
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it says if u go to anyones profile the total points in each section
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think he means what is the minimum amount of points you get from a map in a certain difficulty level
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> e.g. how many points you can get max or min from an insane map
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah its at the bottom of that page
21:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/698980500605239356/unknown.png
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> kinda bothering that the teamrank and rank place and points column arent lined up :monkaS:
21:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> wdym they dont line up
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> if you finish the map in team r1 you get 25 pts, but if people speedrun it in team 0 they obviously will have abetter time hence you lose ranks points
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/698981165729710170/unknown.png
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> he means graphically
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Brokecdx-> lol
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well and the left side of the columns are not aligned either....
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's really getting on my nerves üòõ
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also u dont even need 2 columns
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just 2 descriptions
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just 2 descriptions since columns are exactly the smae
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just 2 descriptions since columns are exactly the same
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> true
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> also there should be spaces between points = stars x multiplier + offset
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> offset + stars * multiplier makes more sense too
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> why
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cause like u add the offset beforehand usually
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> u start from the offset u dont add it at the end
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk, doesn't matter
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well I've seen both
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> its maths it doesnt matter
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> use parentheses then it really doesnt matter
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> U
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is unambiguous without the parens
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ye
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> "DDraceNetwork (DDNet) is an actively maintained version of DDRace, a Teeworlds modification with a unique cooperative gameplay."
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> should be
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> a Teeworlds modification with unique cooperative gameplay.
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think?
21:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> idk which is technically more correct but any normal person would read them both the same
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think first is incorrect and it kinda sounds bad
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> i dont think its necessarily wrong
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> if u remove unique and cooperative
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> which are adjectives
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it becomes a Teeworlds modification with a gameplay
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> but ur describing what the gameplay it has is like
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> a gamemode can have its own gameplay
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yea but u dont say it has a gameplay
21:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> why
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> gameplay isnt a concrete noun
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, I also feel like this indefinite article should be dropped
