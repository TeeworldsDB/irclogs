11:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen that was a bad merge
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wrong playerflags enum, a new one should be created for the extended flags
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also @deen I'd keep the blink for a while, until people upgrade
11:25 <@deen> oh
11:25 <@deen> sorry about that, should I revert?
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> U will remove afk eyes?
11:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Have u tested how the mark looks when like 20 tees are in the same place?
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I kinda like more the eyes, they are more blended in the "world"
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> agree with @heinrich5991 afk eyes were usefull no matter what we do with names
11:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Imo its a bad mark
12:05 <@deen> no
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The eyes were very good imo
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But this exclamation mark is not very good, especially in situations where multiple tees are next to each other and you have to quickly decide who to u freeze
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> But this exclamation mark is not very good, especially in situations where multiple tees are next to each other and you have to quickly decide who to uufreeze
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> eyes arenâ€™t 100% reliable
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> marks neither
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i play with names off
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Cant you fucking add both features
14:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Is that so hard
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> I would love to see the eyes being reliable ðŸ˜ƒ
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> What about eyes blinking
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> I misunderstood somwthing or you're deleting blinking?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Hope I do
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> What about removing emote command. And using open eyes for freeze and closed for afk everywhere
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> wtf
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> never do that
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> why
14:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> it sucks
14:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> daily complain
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> I want ti set eyes on my bird skin to look opposite directions
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> Its too fun to delete
14:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> I want to set eyes on my bird skin to look opposite directions
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <maggi323 [HM6-30W-0QG]> Hey :)
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <maggi323 [HM6-30W-0QG]> What about a settings feature like HD off, but with animations? So you can turn off animations that distract you in a map without the need to turn on entities.
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Confusing already when people don't understand maps because they have hd or quads off. But imagine the trouble explaining the inivible freeze on moving maps
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Wait wat
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Invisible freeze on moving maps? Can u show me?
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Join moving freeze maps on KoG like q-move and then turn of envelopes
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> Is it handled with envelopes
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yes
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> So ye that can suck
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <maggi323 [HM6-30W-0QG]> There aren't many moving maps, and also only KoG
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Not yet
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Because qshar also released moving ddrace map and want to develop more
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Because qshar also recently released moving ddrace map and want to develop more
19:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you can already disable quads which is even worse for such maps
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @timakro https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/3f9d30a
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what does that do? and might that cause weapon switches to repeat?
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @heinrich5991 I might have spotted a problem. I'm pretty sure there can be two input packets for the same tick: one sent regularly and one sent by firing a weapon (maybe also when switching weapons?). It might be possible for weapon switches to happen between those two packets. When those two packets arrive in the input buffer of the server so that the first one is stored at inde <message clipped>
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i dont think it sends the regular inputs if something is changed between one input and the one before it, it recognizes the change and sends an update and resets the  thing that sends regular updates
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Eyes are a shit way of seeing if someone is afk but its a nice touch, I prefer afk people having something that non afks cant have and cant be hidden though changing username is good (and ofc closed eyes, fuck you people who hide names)
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> but its still an interesting problem since it could possibly happen due to lag?
