00:20 < bridge> <gravitycontained> 430.68 T/s
00:20 < bridge> <gravitycontained> very fast indeed
00:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yes if the argument is a complex type such as an instance it self. Which is still horribly unexpected and caught me twice.
00:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> 
00:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I understand it but hate it.
00:34 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I tried many they all come with their own set of bugs
00:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> have you tried https://app.commet.chat/, ChillerDragon?
00:51 < bridge> <heinrich5991> looks kinda like discord
02:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> it does look like discord lol
02:19 < bridge> <chillerdragon> doesn't look or feel as good as chat.zillyhuhn.com or weechat but for matrix its kinda okay
02:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lets hope they also publish a useful ios client
02:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> `test`
02:21 < bridge> <chillerdragon> woah codesnippets work
02:22 < bridge> <chillerdragon> but you can not autocomplete @ pings gg useless
02:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> also idk how to reply here
02:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1708392249.png
02:24 < bridge> <chillerdragon> uff
02:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> they are at 300 commits so they did not manage to add enough bugs yet xd
02:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> give them a bit more time to finish implementing all the base features and it will probably be ever buggier and slower than it is now
02:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> yo @Scrumplex the proxy man. Do you use multiple git remotes for the same repo? I would like to just git push to one repo on my vps or something. And it should then propagate/backup that commit to repos on gitlab/github and whatever cloud service i might add.
02:27 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> You got any clean solution for that?
04:12 < bridge> <Ewan> @scrumplex
04:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ty
06:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I am having a hard time debugging my github ci. Its not ddnet code i am testing its ruby code and i am testing it with a ddnet client and ddnet server. It all works fine locally. But the server tests only run once in the CI.
06:52 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The first server test passes and then no server test passes after that. So the first one must bring the runner in a bad state but i have no idea what that bad state could be.
06:53 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The state is good enough that client tests still pass after that. But my ruby server fails to get any connections from a ddnet client.
06:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> I tried debugging with tcpdump but even tcpdump gets so confused after the first run that it produces an empty pcap file. Which works just fine the first time its run.
07:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> What is there in linux that can go bad? Blocked ports? Something in the filesystem?
07:34 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The benchmarks don't back that up anyway
08:03 < bridge> <scrumplex> Forgejo can mirror your repos for you
08:03 < bridge> <scrumplex> ChillerDragon
09:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @scrumplex but then i have to selfhost that and it only mirrors to it self? I would not cound "on my vps" a backup.
09:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> count*
09:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> or can it also auto distribute it to other destinations?
09:39 < bridge> <scrumplex> yup
09:39 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ah nice
09:40 < bridge> <scrumplex> https://scrumplex.rocks/img/1708418404_RaiQu0.png
09:40 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> hmkay but selfhosting that still sounds more complexity than selfhosting the 10 lines of bash to do it my self
09:40 < bridge> <scrumplex> Looks like it failed recently lol
09:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> F
09:41 < bridge> <scrumplex> yup my GH Token just expired recently
09:41 < bridge> <scrumplex> I guess I just tactically ignored the email
09:42 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ye sounds realistic
09:42 < bridge> <scrumplex> tbf i get a lot of emails from GitHub regarding token expirations so i get why xD
09:43 < bridge> <scrumplex> But I think Forgejo might work for you
09:43 < bridge> <scrumplex> It's very simple to host too
09:43 < bridge> <scrumplex> NixOS users when they `services.forgejo.enable = true;`
09:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> axax nix mentioned

17:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> @baumwollee @draggory i was so scared for a second
18:01 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i wish my vscode was as easy to navigate as this: https://ddnet.org/codebrowser/DDNet/game/server/entities/character.cpp.html
18:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> what can this tool do, what vscode can't for you?
18:24 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i navigate around in vs code with ctrl+shift+f and search üòÇ
18:25 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> for some reasons i couldn't get it working with ctrl + right mouse click, and also autocompilation not working as good
18:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can use ctrl + p to search for files
18:26 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> recommended extention for workspace is installed and all
18:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i do
18:27 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh also clangd etc?
18:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> everything
18:29 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> but i don't have problems tho, i even made my own mod so far (skyblock), just seeing extra thing everytime i search for something üòÇ
18:29 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> and even made me smarter at searching

19:08 < bridge> <das_sith> hi, what is fifo and how can I use it for my ddnet server?
19:10 < bridge> <chairn> well, i kinda agree on the first part, not sure about the second part with the full rewrite stuff
19:10 < bridge> <chairn> I guess it really depends on what you trying to achieve
19:21 < bridge> <furo321> Fifo is a way of sending input to the server console through a file. You can use it with `sv_input_fifo server-input.fifo`, and then you can write stuff to the file and it will be ran by the server, `echo "broadcast test!" > server-input.fifo`.
19:23 < bridge> <das_sith> oh nice, and where is it located?
19:23 < bridge> <das_sith> data/ ?
19:29 < bridge> <furo321> The `server-input.fifo` file? It will be in the same directory as where you started the server, but otherwise you can specify an absolute file path, e.g. `/home/myuser/server-input.fifo` instead.
19:31 < bridge> <nouaa> danke
19:31 < bridge> <nouaa> wrong chat
19:32 < bridge> <nouaa> <a:tobeydance:1020311752572940350>
19:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Assuming you are using Unix. On Windows, FIFO isn't a file but specifies the name of a named pipe.
19:51 < bridge> <reitw> as my teacher once said, everything is file :pepew:
19:52 < bridge> <reitw> but thaat was linux
20:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wazzup ddnetz
20:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> After playing around with fifo Files (or rather pipes) i found Out how horrible IT IS to handle them on windows

22:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I agree that focusing on syntax is not very useful, maybe even superficial

23:12 < bridge> <learath2> It's comparing apples to oranges. Each discussion has a time and place. Though their importance is I guess in the right order
23:13 < bridge> <learath2> If you and I were making a programming language discussion of syntax would be a fairly important one
23:16 < bridge> <zhn> @ryozuki did you use sqlx for runtime insert/update queries with structs that have optional fields? i don't see the way without writing good ol derive macro with use of QueryBuilder<...>
