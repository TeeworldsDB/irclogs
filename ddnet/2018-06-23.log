03:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Do you know the master server is down?
03:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Servers going haywire, 100% CPU, going down and rebooting, etc.
03:43 <+Learath2> god damn kids :(
03:45 <+Learath2> @Pathos it's register-flood, can't really fix it with heinrich5991 being prolly asleep, ddnet servers should work fine through the ddnet tab though
03:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> whats with all the lag on ddnet usa
03:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> i checked status.ddnet.tw and it reports ~88kpkts/sec with almost no players so i guess ddos?
04:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> how can i turn off switche serverside by default again?
04:31 <+Learath2> hmm, it seems master1.ddnet.tw is dosing usa...
04:37 <+Learath2> master1.teeworlds.com*
04:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> how and why
04:55 <+Learath2> I actually have no clue what is going on
04:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> lol
05:00 <+Learath2> okay it's actually ddnet.tw syn flooding usa.ddnet.tw
05:00 <+Learath2> now I'm very very confused
05:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> stop ddosing usa pls
05:01 <+Learath2> why tcpdump would resolve ddnet.tw as master1.teeworlds.com is beyond me
05:02 <+Learath2> well blocking ddnet.tw on usa.ddnet.tw makes everything much better :D
05:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> master1.teeworlds.com 164.132.193.153:8300
05:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> blocking both servers on eachother works, god knows why they were syn flooding eachother :/
05:09 <+Learath2> if only I knew whether ddnet.tw can come back up without supervision, i'd just give it a restart
05:16 <+Learath2> some kind of conn keep open attack with spoofing maybe, but I didn't know you could do those with tcp
05:19 <+Learath2> 409008932 SYN cookies sent :/
05:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> What's syn flooding?
05:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pathos> Oh nevermind, found syn cookies
05:21 <+Learath2> why is it only me awake when weird shit happens?
05:25 <+Learath2> especially weird shit that I have no idea how to fix
05:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> it is happening again
05:58 <+Learath2> sadly this one is an actual syn flood
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> block tcp protocol
05:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> teeworlds use udp only
05:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Kaisi> MySQL not xd
05:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> oh xd
05:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> but
05:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> well
06:06 <+Learath2> tried sth, no idea if it works but oh well
06:08 <+Learath2> well looks much better
07:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> cool
07:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [10:58 PM] Finn: block tcp protocol
07:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> [10:58 PM] Finn: teeworlds use udp only
07:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> 
07:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <onby> +1, also rate limit requests by ip
14:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> can anyone help me? i bought a new pc and nothing fucking works. cant get a picture. no usb works.  (amd ryzon7. asus b350 plus. nvidia gforce gtx970. 2x 8gb ddr4 ram)   heeeeeeeelp
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> turn power on
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> (for real tho "nothing works" doesnt mean anything. does it even boot, does the monitor detect it, what does it show etc)
14:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> it turns on but the monitor doesnt detect it. and my keyboard mouse controler etc.  all usb doesnt turn on
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> you got scammed
14:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i didnt buy it as a whole. i built it
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> that is what i thought, then rebuild it properly
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> search tutorials on youtube
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> if it doesn't work it is because you either don't know how to build it or you bought broken parts
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> does it happen that new parts are broken
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> maybe you forgot to connect a cable?
14:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> check your built
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i checked for 1 hour and couldnt make anything out. the mainboard doesnt peep either which would give some info perhaps
14:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> no unless you got scammed or it got broken before you received it
14:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> where did you buy the parts?
14:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> ebay? xD
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> well anyway stop worrying maybe it is just something you didn't properly
14:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> mindfactory
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> you know that ryzen 2 requires the newest BIOS versions to work on [a, x, b]370 mainboards?
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Im 'corneum do you have multiple graphic outputs? have you tried all of them?
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes i did.
15:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> mh
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i dont get a bios. or at least i cant see one
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does the computer receive a signal, e.g. via hdmi so that it turns on (even if not displaying anything) if you're starting the computer?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> are you german?
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> what do you mean
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> yes
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/amd-ryzen-2-generation-bootprobleme-ohne-bios-update,3326095.html
15:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> that could theoretically be the problem
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Does someone has coincidentally has nvidia cudnn 7.1 for windows? Their download page is broken
15:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Does someone coincidentally has nvidia cudnn 7.1 for windows? Their download page is broken
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> He she it , das S muss mit
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> i do
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> dm me
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> ðŸ™‚
15:36 <+Learath2> do you have a case speaker?
15:36 <+Learath2> without a case speaker it wouldn't beep anyways
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> be careful with running executables from random people on the internet
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> he must has anti virus, it is not a virus, he can confirm the anti virus doesn't complain
15:38 <+Learath2> anti-viruses are not magic
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just because an anti-virus doesn't detect a file, doesn't mean that it doesn't have malicious code
15:38 <+Learath2> they can only identify viruses encountered and identified by researchers before
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> well i am not a virus creator xD
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> i was just going to troll him sending him a big picture
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Hey Finn, would've sent you a dm by now, but i bypassed that login and got a direct link ðŸ˜ƒ
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> "bypassed"
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> oh ðŸ˜¦
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> @Im 'corneum how many cpu pins did you bend
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> i hope none. :P   the cpu just fell into place
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> ok xD
19:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 you could take a look at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/1157 again, if you want ðŸ™‚
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Finn just to say, there's a way called AVE
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> Anti-Virus Evasion
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> it simply bypass AV ðŸ˜›
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> so yea, anti-virus aren't magic
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> anti virus evasion isn't magic too
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> it is
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> have you ever done AVE
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> sure
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> i think you are bluffing
20:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> nop
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> have you bypassed all anti virus?
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> sure I didn't made it by myself because I'm not a reverse engineer
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> but yea i've bypassed all av
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> when was that
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> 2018?
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> reverse enginering to bypass an av?
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> around 6months ago
20:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Ryozuki depends yea xd
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Ryozuki some asm skillz could help for that
20:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> from my little knowledge the best you can do is make a fresh virus and it will work some days till it gets detected and blaclisted by avs
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> actually yea
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> you said AVE is magic, but then you admit you didn't made it yourself, and you could require to know how to program in ASSEMBLY
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> an AVE isn't available all the time
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> you said AVE is magic, but then you admit you didn't made it yourself, and that you could require to know how to program in ASSEMBLY
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> it gets detected after a lot of time, but it works at the start
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> but when it doesn't get detected it is magi
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> but when it doesn't get detected it is magic
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> yes but it requires a hacker to make the hard work
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> then it is not magic
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> sure, but you have some available payloads that does perfectly the job
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> well but xD
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> that sounds like "i am a script kiddie" no? xD
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> actually what i'm saying to you is that anti-virus won't detect all viruses
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> @Finn well for that case sure i'm a script kiddie, ik what I'm doing, but Idk how basically it works
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you know what you are doing but not how it works?
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> sure o::
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> sure o:
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> ok then for you it is magic but for the people who create the AVEs it is not magic
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :thonkery:
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> thats what i meant
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> hey it's magic for them too
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> they're happy to find out something like that
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> it is not magic if you need to spend a lot of hours finding a new way to bypass the anti virus
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> heh?
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> I say it's magic about the fact that it works
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> magic is something you can do instantly without hard work
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> depends of how you say it
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> anyway xD
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> can you infect linux?
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> nu
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> what do u mean lol
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> to create a virus for linux
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> you can make a linux virus too,
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> virus for linux? O:
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think they are called rootkits
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> does it exists? xD
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rootkits
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> yea, not a virus lol
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kinda
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> well I was simply manipulating some backdoors
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> dats all
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but you could create linux viruses, its just that the dumb users use linux
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont use*
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linux
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they use windows
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> heh xd
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> you need root access to use rootkits
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> so
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not at all
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> on windows there's some shits called UAC bypassing
20:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rootkits are made to get root access
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> but sadly there's some programs to detect them
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Rootkit installation can be automated, or an attacker can install it after having obtained root or Administrator access."
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well i guess both
20:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but u could get the user to install a rootkit without knowing
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> e.g a custom repo with apt
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> if he doesn't have linux "skills" or a brain yea
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> as always you are better tricking the human than the machine
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when hacking
20:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> the rootkit needs root access anyway
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> if it can't get root access it can't do anything
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "The term rootkit or root kit originally referred to a maliciously modified set of administrative tools for a Unix-like operating system that granted "root" access.[3] If an intruder could replace the standard administrative tools on a system with a rootkit, the intruder could obtain root access over the system whilst simultaneously concealing these activities from the legitimate <message clipped>
20:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> stop wiki
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> those vulnerabilities get fixed very fast
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i know
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> there are also tools to detect rootkits
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> it needs a vulnerability to get root access by itself
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> never had a rootkit infected my computer
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> cuz you never downloaded any shit or you always looked at the source of a script
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> well
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> but I think the funniest thing is backdoors
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> why would i run any script with root privilegies
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> cuz maybe some scripts needs it?
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> depends of what you're doing
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> the only thing that i run with sudo is apt xD
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> i think
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> the debian package manager
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> I hate sudo
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> why
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> idk, it isn't secure if you do not setup it
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> imagine you didn't configure it correctly
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> & I backdoor your machine with a simple payload injected in a program
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> & now imagine you're too stupid to run it as admin
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> I could create another account
20:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> I wouldn't even need to set it as root, simply the pw would be needed
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> then sudo  & the curr pw of the created acc & I'm done
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> that's a bad example but imagine
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> okay
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> i understand
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> there are scripts online, with malicious code, they run a command, and they log your ip, so they can have access to your server
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> on pastebin
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> yea after i'll show you an example i've already saw
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> ok
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> just need to find it xd
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> ok xD
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> I think it got removed, but well it's easy to detect, but some noobs wouldn't see it
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> someone converted some shell code in hexa & converted it then in the code in plain text to execute it
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> i know, they encode the command with escape sequences i think
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> that's basic, rly basic, but it is a little example of shit malicious code
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> and they can do that in any language
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> but it wouldn't work on a personal computer i think
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> only on servers
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> i think
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> because how could they get access toyour computer remotely?
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> reverse tcp
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> what if you dynamic ip, and all ports closed
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> what if you have dynamic ip, and all ports closed
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> what is that
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> it is the victim that initialize a connection
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> you can backdoor someone like that
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> ph
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> oh
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard> so, Victim - syn -> attacker
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> ok i get it
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Finn> i think that people can do anything and they think they can't because they can't see a way to achieve what they want, but the way is front on them, they just can't see it in their minds
