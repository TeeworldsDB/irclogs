09:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Approved
11:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyone here who has Tele Columbus / PYUR ISP (in Germany) and can enable native ipv6 in router? We have an issue where it resolves ger2.ddnet.org to an ipv6 address, which is wrong. I want to make sure this is a configuration issue from the ISP
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Anyone has good ideas how to make DDNet more noob-friendly? See https://steamcommunity.com/id/sancarn/recommended/412220/
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Add more tutorials
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Current is getting started. Next should explain how to connect dummy and do very basic ddrace
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Add an aim bot and press the keys for them
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Part 3 some harder stuff like towers
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Part 4 wall hammers
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Most novice are also rather hard. Esp the old school ones
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> The game is much easier (to start playing) than 10 years ago
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> School hook and the other stuff isn't really novice beginner level
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> But we lack of good introduction maps
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Also slash r should be on
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Should we really have a map with a "press [key]" to move "right"
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Or generally no falling
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Failing
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> No /r, otherwise they'll be confused on any other maps
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Then teleport
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Yep
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> Probably Yes
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But failing is 5 star is maybe 4-5 star novice only
12:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But failing is maybe 4-5 star novice only
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> We have that. The guy even played it
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> But its too hard to start playing correctly when the most played map is multeasymap and its not beginner friendly at all haha
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> It would be good if we could display the key one has picked. Some people jump with w (qwerty), space, or even alt so we can't jusst write "press space to jump"
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> But after 30 minutes play u don't have the aim for dummy dragging parts yet
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> It would be good if we could display the keys one has picked. Some people jump with w (qwerty), space, or even alt so we can't jusst write "press space to jump"
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> It would be good if we could display the keys one has picked. Some people jump with w (qwerty), space, or even alt so we can't just write "press space to jump"
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> You need to face the difficulty to improve in the end
12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> And I believe our novice maps cover everything there is to know and to learn
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> At least, the basics
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Got nothing to say bad about the current methods to teach players how the game works.
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> -> You start off in the Tutorial map (maybe you could make it so that you can't skip it, it's annoying, but I still see a few people with 0 points in something like a Kobra).
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> -> Novice filter gets set properly (maybe you could suggest people to try out a lower star map)
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Got nothing to say bad about the current methods to teach players how the game works.
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> -> You already start off in the Tutorial map (maybe you could make it so that you can't skip it, it's annoying, but I still see a few people with 0 points in something like a Kobra).
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> -> Novice filter gets set properly (maybe you could suggest people to try out a lower star map)
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Got nothing to say wrong about the current methods to teach players how the game works.
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> -> You already start off in the Tutorial map (maybe you could make it so that you can't skip it, it's annoying, but I still see a few people with 0 points in something like a Kobra).
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> -> Novice filter gets appropriately set (maybe you could suggest people try out a lower star map instead of hopping into a 3+ star one)
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think the guy just doesnt put effort
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this game rly ticks people who like the reward for their efforts
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no hand holding gaming like these days
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> ^
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> But maybe you could make a difficulty tab for the browser
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ultimately
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the difficulty is what makes this game so addicting
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its whatm akes people play for 6 hours straight on maps
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> easy stuff gets boring easily
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u just cant catter to everybody
12:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and that shouldnt be on ur mind
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> But maybe you could make a difficulty tab for the browser (so the difficulty of the map gets displayed, you only figure it out by looking at the server/voting tab once you joined a server)
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen maybe put a Novice specific tab?
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> DDnet - New Players
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> nah
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I know that with effort you can get started in DDNet, but we are trying to make it easier for people who don't put in that effort
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Or we should market more to "hardcore pro gamers"
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well in my opinion if they dont put the effort they wont like it
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think we shouldnt bend over backwards to people who simply arent into this type of game
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> But maybe you could make a difficulty tab for the browser (so the difficulty of the map gets displayed, you only figure it out by looking at the server/voting tab once you joined a server. which a lot of people won't look at. because they either don't care or don't know how to navigate through the UI)
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > Want to play the hardest game ever? Want to finish no map ever? Want to suffer for hours and cry, getting nothing in return? Come play DDNet with a community of other sufferers!
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> advertise it as pure skill based
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> I agree, it seems like he wants to be rewarded and "finish" the game by doing nothing. If if struggles on novice, don't let him know about the brutal and insane categories
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt finish a novice map for 1-2 months
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and when i did
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> that's not a good description
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it was a rly good feeling kek
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> that's not a good description. you easily find people guiding you through easier maps.
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> that's not a good description. you easily find people guiding you through easier maps. so you get to finish at least a few maps until it gets hard and brain worky.
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the problem is that they probs see it as "if you dont finish the map you havent achieved something" as in you didnt have fun if you didnt finish
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but actually finishing is the least of the fun lol
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> road is the goal
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> learning how to solve challenges
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> solving them yourself
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> finding mates
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Want to play a skill based game that will reward your efforts to learn its mechanics? With only yourself as the barrier to entry (no paywalls!) you can join DDNet and enjoy this unique cooperative game that will test even the most hardcore players!
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> smth like that
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> that's not a good description. you easily find people guiding you through easier maps. so you get to finish at least a few maps until it gets (mechanical) hard and brain worky.
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> someone with a marketing degree should do it kek
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> That. And probably most players start this game because of people like Aoe
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> making emphasis on no paywalls is important
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for free to play games
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> That. And probably most players start this game because of people like Aoe. At least I did start to play this game because of him.
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> That. And probably most players start this game because of people like Aoe. At least I did start to play this game because of him. Seen open-source being a big argument too.
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> That. And probably most players start this game because of people like Aoe. At least I did start to play this game because of him. Seen open source is a big argument too. Also, you hardly find any other Jump and Run MMO. This one also is easy to start off in but hard to master.
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We are not "free to play", we are "free"
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> "free to play" indicates that playing is free, but you have to pay for something else, so I don't like the term
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1051826545414647808/image.png
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doesnt matter
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> normal people often assume free games have paywalls sometimes
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its not bad to make it clear
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> >totally free ?
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> >~~totally~~ completely free ?
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > DDraceNetwork (DDNet) started out as a simple modification of Teeworlds, a 2D action shooter. But, in DDNet, you don't fight against each other - instead, you work together with up to 64 people and push your way through maps.
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should also stop mentioned teeworlds
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl dont know it and dont care
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> btw steam page can have gifs
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we could put  some there
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> see

12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> lool
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> yea maybe adding a chat filter wouldn't be too bad
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> to the official servers at least
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> another review calling this game commie cuz lot of russians and chinese
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lol
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1051828433140863056/image.png
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> What kind of gifs do you imagine would be good? Just some gameplay? Fancy animation?
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would show off lots of tees together honestly
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and maybe some hammerfly
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but better ask others xD
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lots of tees together -> description of community
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hammer fly -> description of techniques
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in a simple way ofc
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and the tee wiki logo
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with a link to the wiki
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :wiki:
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> DDoS attacks were solved by kicking players sending too many packets.
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> If people from outside send too much traffic, maybe adding something like Cloudflare could help.
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> DDoS attacks were solved by kicking players sending too many packets.
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> If people from outside send too much traffic (should be blocked by default, if it isn't a connection attempt), maybe adding something like Cloudflare could help.
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Cloudflare ddos protection is only for websites
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I wish it were that easy
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> domains
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> domains
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah its only for http
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> It won't block the traffic coming to ddnet servers
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I talked to Cloudflare developers, they haven't been able to help us

12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can read more
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> example of gifs
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> does it cost you guys something to add steam cosmetics to the game?
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> I hate that my favorite games don't have them
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> MW2, Teeworlds, the list is long
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u have to know u can play this without steam
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> yea but then it is optional
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe we could integrate the workshop to download assets and put the im the assets folder
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i neverchecked it tho
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/workshop
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Good enough for now
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1051831584363397151/Screenshot_2022-12-12_at_13.03.04.png
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> I could recommend this game to people breaking games if you accept *any* traffic. I could see people staying when they like the game.
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yair> how to increase the hammer range?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> I could recommend this game to people breaking games if you accept *any* traffic. I could see people staying when they like to play the game.
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> I could recommend this game to people breaking games if you accept *any* traffic. Similar to how I recommend the Game Growtopia atm (for anyone wanting to learn how to bypass user-mode anti-cheats, assembly, and reversing in general). I could see people staying when they like to play the game.

13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Please don't tell attackers to attack this game...
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lmao we have enough of those
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> Novice but with /r enabled everywhere
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Not so sure about this. All the bot clients/hacks I have seen for this game are nearly a decade out.
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Not so sure about this. All the bot clients/hacks I have seen for this game are nearly a decade out. And they even get detected as such. Resulting in its users getting banned from the servers.
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Not so sure about this. All the bot clients/hacks I have seen for this game are nearly a decade old. And they even get detected as such. Resulting in its users getting banned from the servers.
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Not true, we are struggling with new bots
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Yeah and bans are useless
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But I won't give more details in order not to help the bot developers
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I can't think about a proper way to ban people on an opensource game
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yair> btw if u talkin about bots and stuff anyone got good pathfinder code? mine kinda shitty and to lazy to work on it
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> That's alright. Banning them instantly already does that. But you can't ban in waves as well. Because that would impact the other players experience.
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> accounts?
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> >creates a new one
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> yes but then you need something to avoid people creating alot of accounts
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Sure
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> >creates a new one
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> Did I mention the game Growtopia yet? more than 50% of the 80k users online are bots.
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> And I don't see HWID bans for this game becoming a thing
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> lol
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> hwid ban is useless
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> yes all bans are useless
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> fingerprint to enter the game
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> look for it, there was a good one the last time I surfed github
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> fingerprint to enter the game
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> the only way to avoid cheaters would be to do it like China. Requiring your residential info upon registering for a game. Reducing your social credit score by a lot when caught cheating.

13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> this is not possible at all
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> yea I know
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> that was a joke
13:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> look for it, there was a good one the last time I surfed on github

But it is way less.
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> guys i need your help, I've had a framelag problem for a long time, they seem invisible but they make the game impossible for me, it didn't do it before and I don't know how to solve it, I posted a video a while ago if you give me permission I'll link it
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> I even tried to format the pc
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> if it's a youtube link you can share it here
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAeSM-MW8WU
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> they are imperceptible but if you focus you can see it
13:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> clearly visible
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> does look more like server lag
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <yair> i got those but x100 stronger ur net prob shit or smth
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> Yeah just lags I guess
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> what's ur ping average lul
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> are you playing with wifi?
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> i have this problem with all maps
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> wifi?
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> with a cable
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> then most likely packet loss then
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> then most likely packet loss
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> what can i do for fix it?
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> there is a thing under windows where you can give a specific process net priority
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> there is a thing under windows where you can give a specific process network priority
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> there is a thing under windows where you can give a specific process network priority
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> but not sure if that could help here
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I think there was a way to visually see what's happening (in a form of a graph)
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ctrl+shift+d with something else, forgot
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> is that a game or operating system feature?
13:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Game
13:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> on task manager?
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> dbg_graphs
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> And ctrl+shift+d ingame
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> I think
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> what is that?
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Press f1 and type this command
13:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> And do ctrl+shift+d also ingame
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> i did it
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> now?
13:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> U should see some graphs while playing
13:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> i'm gonna make a video
13:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> if there is no obvious spike down (or up, idk), the problem may lay somewhere else
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> if there is no obvious spike down (or up, idk how the games graph works), the problem may lay somewhere else
13:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> if there is no obvious spike down (or up, idk how the games graph works), the problem may lay somewhere else (not network related at least)
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> if there is no obvious spike down (or up, idk how the games graph works) while a stutter like that happens, the problem may lay somewhere else (not network related at least)
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> if there is no obvious spike down (or up, idk how the games graph works) while a stutter like that happens, the problem may lay somewhere else (not network related at least)
13:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> but the first video seriously didn't look like FPS loss or something, more like your hook not getting accepted by the server due to whatever f reason.
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> if there is no obvious spike down (or up, idk how the games graph works) while a stutter like that happens, the problem may lay somewhere else (not network related at least)
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> but the first video seriously didn't look like FPS loss or something, more like your hook not getting accepted by the server due to whatever f reason. so if the network can't be blamed, the game can't be blamed at all here.

13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> can u see something wrong or i have to make a video?
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> second graph looks interesting
13:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> a video would be better
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> ok i have to download something for doing that
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> enable ctrl-shift-d and ctrl-shift-g
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> do you have a NVIDIA graphics card?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh, you did so already
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> do you have a NVIDIA graphics card?
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> then you can just use shadowplay
13:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pie. is this problem on all locations or only one? Can you try a different server?
13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> this problem is for all servers

13:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can you run `ping -c ger2.ddnet.org` (or whatever server that is) in cmd.exe for a few minutes, then cancel it with ctrl-c and send the result?
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> yes but i have to uptade it
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> really?
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> sry if my english is bad
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> CTRL+SHIFT+G should show up the overlay
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> at least I think it was that
13:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> really? NVIDIA doesn't do forced updates
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> really? NVIDIA doesn't do forced updates (never heard of that before)
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> but do this while you are updating
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> deen is smart one here
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> deen is the smart one here
13:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> it asks me to specify the ip address
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> make a ping then to resolve the domain to an ip
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> ping ger2.ddnet.org
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> ``ping ger2.ddnet.org``
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @deen he can prob run WinMTR for that
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1051841973239160852/image.png
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> and now copy that ip and use the command deen suggested
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> ah ok
13:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Sorry, it's `ping -t ger2.ddnet.org`
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1051842370087440404/image.png
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> yea do what he tells
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> run it for a while
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> and then stop it
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1051842569400746004/image.png
13:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> CTRL+C maybe cancels it
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> then copy all lines, paste them into a textfile and send it deen
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/27780
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Download WinMTR & enter ger2.ddnet.org
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Press Start
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Copy as TEXT -> send to deen
13:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So no packet loss, but it jumps to 84 ms sometimes, that could already be the cause for the lags you see
13:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> if that is with LAN cable, and you get the same result pinging anything, then it's probably just your internet connection and only your ISP can fix it
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1051844288197165137/file.TXT
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you should run it for 5mins
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> you should run it for 5mins, so there's enough info
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> but looks normal in this file
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Well this looks kinda good, interesting part is the ~ +30 ping from 151.6.3.89 to fra core-backbone
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> like that?
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pie.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1051845516272603157/file1.TXT
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Now deen's server MTR would be interesting
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 😄
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> > 151.7.215.56 -    0 |  306 |  306 |    5 |   15 |  153 |    7 |
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious>

13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> 153 worst 😄
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> But internet routing is over-engineered sometimes. We are hosting a server in turkiye and player have been routed from the local hoster to Budapest and back.

14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> anyone know how I can use a rust library in compiler explorer?
14:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> it is easy enough to 'add' the library, but I fail to import it in the code
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm most online compielrs usually only support top 100 crates
14:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but idk
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> yes, they have a limited set of crates, but I fail to use one of them
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> can u show?
14:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> sure, sec
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://godbolt.org/z/nrzerz8r4
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> ah it might just be a problem with the integration of the bitflags library, I have no problem importing from `quote`
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> maybe I need to select an earlier edition or smth
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> meh
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> weird
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh true
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> igotta update gentoo
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> updated the live ebuild to truly be live with rust pkgs
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and added 16.6
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> tho needs to wait till guru oficials merge into master
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Why there is rust in ddnet
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For lulz
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :what:
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz we know whats good
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Whats good
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Overengineered code?
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rust over c++
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> So you can press F1, and write `rust_version`. That is the only use case so far 😄
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But now new functionality can be added using Rust, which is nice for memory safety
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Sure...
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Waiting for new functionality
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Be the change you want to see
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @uwu why u hatin
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Im just asking why would you add it if you have nothing to add in addition yet:feelsbadman:
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Like ok if you want to pake some dope pop ups or custom ui by server (just examples), but you add it just to let it bw
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Like ok if you want to pake some dope pop ups or custom ui by server (just examples), but you add it just to let it be
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Like ok if you want to make some dope pop ups or custom ui by server (just examples), but you add it just to let it be
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Because now people who want to add a feature in Rust don't have the excuse to say "Well, there is no Rust support in DDNet yet and it would take me months just to add that"
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I didnt see a single person who would say that:monkalaugh:
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> But i mean, sure
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Sounds good
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> who codes in rust anyways
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> ugly crab
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> So now you can make everything in rust instead of c++ or only some things
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :feelsbadman: no u
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> I like ferris

18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> People who care about security and performance
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 475 issues nice, when do we get gh discussions back
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> since they filtered all the useless issues
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Security does not exist :troll:
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> when did it get so cute lol
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i remember it being ugly
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Dafuk
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Always has been cute
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> okay javascript support in ddnet client when?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the day after yesterday
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> so today
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but only if we can preallocate 8gb ram
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i meant 8tb sry
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> :feelsbadman:
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Is it possible to change the new zoom setting in the editor ? It's too slow and too smooth to me
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it was already changed
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> try nightly
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or maybe it was only changed today
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then wait 1 day
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Oh ok 🙂
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pipou> Thanks
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> at least there sohuld be a setting now
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> what file to delete to get my flags back in the server browser?
21:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> none i guess
21:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> ddnet client folder and get teeworlds kek
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> thanks, fixed it
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> guess the old bug of it redownloading *something* still exists.
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> must have happened when I accidentally launched a debug version of the game
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> it's not a bug, it's a feature 🙂
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> yea that breaks the flag
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> cool feature
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DefaultO> also it made my tee be hardstuck on one emote
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> F1, `ed_smooth_zoom_time 0`
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not so sure about that. ddnet mostly has harder maps than the one I started with
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's true that novice maps are actually hard though. we need to guide players to the easy ones
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> they were just completely forgotten
