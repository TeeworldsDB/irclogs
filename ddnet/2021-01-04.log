00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki you can just run clang-format -i on the files that it complains about
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do you use clang-format at SAP? do you have CI commit the styling?
00:39 <+ChillerDragon> @timakro why rewrite something that already exists and lul gitfront
00:40 <+ChillerDragon> @timakro if i ever need auto detection i might get back to it until then i probably wont try it sorry :/ but if you want to build something useful write a autocompletion for tw config files pls
00:41 <+ChillerDragon> oh interesting @Patiga but shifting the map up down and left and right is probably way more useful to extend existing maps
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> @Jupstar âœª any suggestion on stitching screenshots? the subpixel always messes up the edges <a:ragouis:771864118609182780>

10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 Yes, we use clang-format in our product. I can't speak for all of SAP, kind of a large company ðŸ˜„ Anyway, we have our own package manager of sorts that keeps the development tools of every developer at a consistent version.
