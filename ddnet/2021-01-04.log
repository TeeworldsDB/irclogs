00:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki you can just run clang-format -i on the files that it complains about
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen do you use clang-format at SAP? do you have CI commit the styling?
00:39 <+ChillerDragon> @timakro why rewrite something that already exists and lul gitfront
00:40 <+ChillerDragon> @timakro if i ever need auto detection i might get back to it until then i probably wont try it sorry :/ but if you want to build something useful write a autocompletion for tw config files pls
00:41 <+ChillerDragon> oh interesting @Patiga but shifting the map up down and left and right is probably way more useful to extend existing maps
05:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> @Jupstar ✪ any suggestion on stitching screenshots? the subpixel always messes up the edges <a:ragouis:771864118609182780>

06:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie 🌈> nvm, made an alphamask and blended the overlapping parts, it looks ok i guess.

10:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 Yes, we use clang-format in our product. I can't speak for all of SAP, kind of a large company 😄 Anyway, we have our own package manager of sorts that keeps the development tools of every developer at a consistent version.
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <M Emile> what does the "gametime margin" graph in debug mean
13:00 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: you what?
13:01 <+ChillerDragon> xd fstd :p
13:01 <+ChillerDragon> see #teeworlds fstd 
13:01 <+ChillerDragon> ofc u idle in #teeworlds-dev the underground irc xd
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> ban stronghold map for 3 days
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Дядя Женя> maps*
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Why should you be allowed to decide whether something is banned or not?
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Rus trashtalker back
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Xd
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cøke> Just like that with a list of the worst maps, who gives you the right to rate maps? Everyone likes other maps, there are only maps that are liked more and less.
16:34 <+ChillerDragon> ban votes and force stronghold for 3 days
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> we all know that all ama maps take top of worst maps list
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> :troll:
17:27 <+ChillerDragon> Ama is my idol u bully
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> I would like to see which of my maps would be rated the worst
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> i would probably win the competition because my maps are known and i am known
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> and not because my map is the worst on ddnet
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> SL1
18:53 <+ChillerDragon> springlobe1?
18:53 <+ChillerDragon> isnt that themix
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> no its SL1
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap now supports map rotating :D
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ama> is there a way to map online and not in ddnet
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> teeuniverse maybe
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> idk if its online tho
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 could we have ddnet_properties support more tiles? I'd like to have more for sorting maps by available tiles: https://ddnet.tw/tiles/WEAPON_GRENADE/
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @noby u
22:04 <+ChillerDragon> a few more days and my system is ded i guess https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1609794030.png
22:04 <+ChillerDragon> rip
22:14 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon what did u do
22:14 <+Ryozuki> i never got a segfault with pacman xd
22:14 <+Ryozuki> maybe ur hdd or ssd is dieying
22:14 <+Ryozuki> or ur memory is corrupted
22:15 <+Ryozuki> just today i read this https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linus-Torvalds-ECC
22:15 <+Ryozuki> xd
22:16 <+Ryozuki> why is ECC ram not the common one
22:16 <+Ryozuki> > The consequence of a memory error is system-dependent. In systems without ECC, an error can lead either to a crash or to corruption of data; 
22:17 <+Ryozuki> good video about error correcting btw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8jsijhllIA
22:18 <+Ryozuki> oh they uploaded a new vid
22:18 <+Ryozuki> brb
22:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> is there something better than hamming code?
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the video said yes
22:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Due to the limited redundancy that Hamming codes add to the data, they can only detect and correct errors when the error rate is low. This is the case in computer memory (usually RAM), where bit errors are extremely rare and Hamming codes are widely used, and a RAM with this correction system is a ECC RAM (ECC memory). In this context, an extended Hamming code having one extra parity bit is often used. Extended Hamming codes achieve a Ham
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hamming codes are actualy used by ecc ram lel
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> modern wireless tech uses Reed–Muller code
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Muller_code
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> read like meed ruller code xd
