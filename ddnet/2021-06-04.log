16:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> like this ?
16:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Astramast yes, like this. thanks for creating an issue üôÇ
16:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Astramast> what do u think about it ?
16:44 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I already commented on the issue @Astramast üòâ
17:46 < bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> that kinda gay :justatest:
20:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon.*> lmao since when is the ddnet discord logo a lgbtq flag? u all gays
20:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon.* I've had enough of this
20:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon.*> xd
20:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> jesus im trollin
20:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> my pic is same
20:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> just wondering since when and why
20:13 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wowow message is deleted on matrix too
20:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> cant escape the censoreship now
20:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> henlo?
20:15 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> can't escape the void either
20:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ye veri sad
20:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> guess its not tolerated to talk about the new logo
20:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm guessing you said something insensitive, we already talked about it long enough
20:18 < ChillerDragon> what where?
20:18 < ChillerDragon> i havent seen a single mention of it
20:18 < ChillerDragon> im actually curious
20:19 < ChillerDragon> i thought i can say something "insensitive" when i use the same pic for years and get all these comments too had to make the joke
20:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well idk what you said, I just made a guess
20:20 < ChillerDragon> check irc
20:20 < ChillerDragon> i just asked since wen the flag? +comment
20:23 < ChillerDragon> so? any quick sum of what happend? where it has been discussed and how long its in use?
20:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hello anyone?
20:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> who decided to pick that logo? and why?
20:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> for how long has it been like that?
20:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> if you want to talk about the logo, do it in #off-topic (which yes, i know means using discord)
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ...
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ouch
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> we had a very long "conversation" about it on wednesday and we're not permitting that discussion outside of #off-topic anymore
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> idk what channel that is
20:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but can we bridge it too? \<3
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> not a bad idea to allow #off-topic for bridge, so IRC/Matrix users can still chat without using the dev channel
20:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> @Learath2 thoughts on that? i know you're busy
20:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well since we can't right now, ill just summarize and we'll be done with it: server icon changed to a pride icon to show solidarity for lgbt people, and many people in general got cranky and used the opportunity to say not so nice things. then the channel went into slow mode and now we're requiring continued discussion to happen in #off-topic
20:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ah nice
20:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so still
20:48 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> who and when?
20:49 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i don't know specifics, someone might be able to answer you later
20:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> cool thanks @lynn \<3
20:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> do reactions work in matrix?
20:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> [Zwelf](https://matrix.to/#/@zwelf:tchncs.de)\:  when fix matrix logo to be also rainbow üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
20:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nah
20:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> no reactions yet \:( sad
20:50 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> sad :(
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> what's wrong with Discord in web browser?
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> do profile icons show in matrix?
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yes
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> nice
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> discord and web browser
20:51 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Comrade)
20:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> what's happening with it
20:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> both wrong
20:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but have to admit this electron element is half browser xd
20:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in matrix you're allowed to mod your client
20:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in discord you aren't
20:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think that's already quite some argument in favor of matrix
20:52 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> fkin discord tos
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> so sad they banned my acc and did not explain why i can not install bridges on my discord server because i cant get my acc back \:(
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> matrix is idealogically better but it felt clunky to me when i used the web FE
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Discord is far from idea for sure, but many people use it nowadays
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Discord is far from ideal for sure, but many people use it nowadays
20:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Zwelf> If you give me the svg I can set it as the icon for matrix as well üôÇ
20:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Comrade\: also many people use windows or are homophobic aint no reason to join em \:p
20:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> oh btw @heinrich5991  i got [Zwelf](https://matrix.to/#/@zwelf:tchncs.de)  in
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes, but isn't the web version better than some bridges?
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> has anyone tested mentions to matrix users yet?
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> is there some format that would get parsed correctly
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> matrix has keyword mentions
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> u can just ping like in tw
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon hi?
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> got it
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> so just chillerdragon
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yes
20:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> perfect
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> image.png
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/850447839946473472/image.png
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> both hit btw xd
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i was going to say chillerdragon that you are right about avoiding discord for that reason xD
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> can i ping @lynn and @lynn  ?
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i use it for the main reason i think everyone does, which is that other people do
20:56 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> only the latter usage worked
20:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i would use xmpp or matrix if others did
20:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Comrade\: i wish i did not have to use bridges and could talk only in messengers i like nativley but its better than the web imo
20:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes, people use Discord because other people use it
20:57 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> much #developer
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yo @heinrich5991  can we get more channels bridged?
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i rly dont wanna spam developer all day
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> meh, i mean as long as another channel is not bridged, there's no alternative
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> also heinrich this channel description should be updated to mention matrix
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> the irc bridges were kinda effort to setup but this matrix bridge is so simple
20:58 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> could slap in more channels
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ask Zwelf if he wants to maintain it
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think at least matrix makes sense for #off-topic
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> he said yes
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think general would confuse people
20:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i would love general
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'll talk to Zwelf
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> same but we would have to explain to all the people who don't understand bridges what is happening xd
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yay
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> why
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> cus discord ppl are noobs
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> the bridge is neat enough that it looks almost like real discord users
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> they dont already know that you have to mention by nickname
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i had to figure that out
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yee whatever
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> what about DMs? üòÑ
21:00 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but i think it's not bad
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i prefer some confusion over being excluded completley
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> chillerdragon do you have xmpp?
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> nah
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> dammit
21:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> well lynn@pew.im if you ever make one
21:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> is it any good?
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> it rings a bell
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but idk
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think xmpp is great, but a lot of people don't like it because it's older
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> sounds like irc
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think the tech holds up way better than irc though
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> sounds like irc still xd
21:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> no it's way different imo
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> encryption, more protocol for things
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has a very nice android and linux client
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> is it federated?
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yes
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> does it have accounts?
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (matrix is a new xmpp)
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i see
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> 404.city is a decent instance
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> wait so matrix is xml based?
21:04 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> but i dont really know many xmpp servers that are good
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i think it's json
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> yea i guess to
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> xmpp is xml, matrix is json
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> but calling json xml is probably legal
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> looking at ajax \:D
21:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but people say this is something really minor, and the real differences lie elsewhere
21:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> lol
21:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> https://list.jabber.at/
21:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> this is a better list imo, i can at least recognize some of these https://xmpp-servers.404.city/
21:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this suggests good servers for xmpp: https://compliance.conversations.im/
21:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i see no reason to hop on xmpp when i feel good in irc and matrix
21:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> yeah fair :P it would be only for me and heinrich
21:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> xmpp muc for teeworlds would be cute though
21:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't feel like maintaining another bridge tbh
21:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i have heinrich on wire thats good enough
21:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> and tbh idk u
21:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> you could, if you made an xmpp account xD
21:08 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> i wont sit here all day
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe i just need to try matrix again
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hehe
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> tw chat masterrace
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> if u want to dm me whisper me in game im online 24/7
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> true
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> teeworlds is best chat protocol
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> no accounts
21:09 < bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> federated
