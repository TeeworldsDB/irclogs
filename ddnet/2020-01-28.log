02:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tea> yo can we fix the bug where if you open/tab to ddnet on windows 10 while you're playing a video in the active tab, the whole game crashes and sometimes even crashes your computer for 5 minutes?
02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> no
03:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @tea does it happen always? what software do you use to play the video?
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tea> whenever any video playing
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tea> youtube, other website, whatever
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so browser
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> is it reproducable?
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ddnet should not crash your computer i guess
03:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sounds like your system is broken
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @tea since which version do you have these issues? And does downgrading solve them?
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tea> yes
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tea> always reproducable
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tea> whenever watching youtube
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tea> and tab to latest vers of ddnet
03:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tea> boom crash
03:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tea> idk i might try downgrading but
04:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> use different browser
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tea> wtf
04:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tea> no
04:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> just try
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @tea yes try it. Also try running ddnet with a debugger. Since you are the only person who can reproduce I guess you are the one with the best chance to fix the issue.
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> I've also found a bug, but IDK id it even counts as bug. So I have 2 monitors, first with 144Hz and the second with 60Hz. When DDnet window becomes unfocused (when I switch to second mon.) And then return it into focus the game starts to be very laggy. Like it would be with 30-60 fps and Image could be even seriously blurred sometimes.
12:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Evgesha> As I understood it happens only If I use Borderless Window, goes away when fullscreen.

13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> I'm using a very similar setup, just with 2 screens, and don't have this issue on borderless.
13:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have a similar issue with 2 screens that are exactly the same, been trying to debug it for the last couple years, very hard to do given it's not consistently reproducible
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ScReeNy> This is a bit weird, but i once was told to deactivate Windows Notification Assistant completely and remember to have gotten improvements.
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does someone have a script that "compiles" teeworlds configs. So it follows ``exec`` calls and composes one big complete config file
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> like a c preprocessor handling the #includes
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ok i quickly cracked it together in bash in case anyone ever needs it and greps the irc logs xd http://zillyhuhn.com:8080/Cv
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> well my paste service probably died until that happens so sorry irc:
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
15:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> #!/bin/bash
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> function include_exec() {
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>     local config="$1"
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>     while read -r line
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>     do
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>         if [[ "$line" =~ exec\ (.*\.cfg) ]]
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>         then
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>             include_exec "${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>         else
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>             echo "$line"
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>         fi
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon>     done < "$config"
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> }
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> include_exec "autoexec.cfg"
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ```
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> @ChillerDragon can you make a function to write text with text-mapres on keyboard for your bs-client?
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its not bs client its ux client :/
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sounds like a really useful feature i was thinking the same once writing text with mapres is tidious af
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but sounds like im too nobo for it i can add it to the todo and we will see @Im 'corneum
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @ChillerDragon Also the mapres would need to have letters/symbols in same place, and as far as I remember, every single one looked different ^^
20:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> you could do something with automapper
20:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> or just choose one format that every tileset has to follow
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One format is the only viable way to do this
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unicode support when
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜›
20:42 <+Learath2> Just no
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how am I going to type â›„ though?
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Lol why do you need a "then" in bash after if, seems useless
20:53 <@deen> same reason you have { and } in C
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @jao i dont see how a automapper should take care of typing
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @jao it maybe could guess words that would be cool :D
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> omg ima write that automapper for me
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Im 'corneum if you have same words you type over and over and they have different lengths i could write you a automapper as well
21:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'ma drop some gpt2 buzzwords in here
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Nex
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @NeXus dont rant on bash its literally best programming language out there
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it has quite some problems IMO
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> tell me one
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. that you have to quote all variables in order to *not* split them by whitespace
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hmm
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ok that really annoyed me today
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> because ``cmake .. "$cmake_flags"`` doesnt work
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> and shellcheck said i should use arrays lol
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but other than this edge case you get used to quoting really fast
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> worth it because you gain incredible scaffolding speed
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> literally any software becomes a function in your script without any dependency headache
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> you start by playing in your interactive shell and then ur half way done already
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <LickouT> @fokkonaut
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ?
