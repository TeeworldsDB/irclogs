10:08 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: JOIN messages don't generate more traffic then they take though
10:08 <@heinrich5991> mh?
10:08 <@heinrich5991> ah yes
10:08 <@heinrich5991> but having 10:1 reflectability is better than 1:1
10:10 <@deen> the serverinfo requests would be more interesting, but you can't make those packets bigger without making server browser slower
10:10 <+Learath2> well http masters would help with serverinfo
10:11 <@heinrich5991> yes.
10:11 <@heinrich5991> I'll hopefully get to http masters soon
10:12 <@heinrich5991> I suspended work on that to try to work on a 0.6.* that fixes the spoofing issues
10:13 <@heinrich5991> (which is why I thought about the CONNECT packet)
10:14 <@deen> http masters would be great :)
10:27 <@heinrich5991> okay
10:27 <@heinrich5991> so we have
10:27 <@heinrich5991> CONNECT ->
10:27 <@heinrich5991> <- CONNECTACCEPT
10:27 <@heinrich5991> the client has learned the server's token
10:30 <@heinrich5991> since I don't want to make ACCEPT -> mandatory, I think the server should accept the client on the first normal (non-CTRL) packet
10:32 <@heinrich5991> so the server sees a normal packet with a matching token, it checks whether the client should connect, and if so, accepts the client
10:33 <@heinrich5991> does that sound reasonable? e.g. Learath2?
11:46 <@heinrich5991> deen: do you know whether this code path gets hit? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/c47697bdef138f142f9609614173ffc384282e0f#diff-a60948952f625787eb8b3cf54f82d047R366
11:47 <@deen> Nope, but an attacker might trigger it
11:47 <@deen> I mean "nope, I don't know"
11:55 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: you added this, do you know it? ^
12:58 <+EastByte> heinrich5991: when a ddnet client gets disconnected/timeouted on client-side only (i.e. because the connection cut of or something) and tries to reconnect with the same source port. The server will reuse the prior session.
13:22 <+Learath2> heinrich5991: make sure the new CONNECT can be extended somehow, we might want to add other security features later
15:15 <+Ryozuki> deen, u there?
15:17 <@deen> sometimes
15:17 <+Ryozuki> i saw the man page issue
15:18 <+Ryozuki> so i wondered if this is true " Teeworlds was written by Magnus Auvinen. DDRace was written by Shereef Marzouk. DDNet was written
15:18 <+Ryozuki>        by Dennis Felsing."
15:18 <@deen> Which part of it?
15:18 <+Ryozuki> he wrote that, i dont know why he uses the past tense and nor if u did fully write ddnet
15:18 <@deen> There are some steps inbetween missing
15:18 <@deen> I didn't, lots of people helped
15:18 <+Ryozuki> yeah thats what i thought
15:19 <@deen> But I'm no teehistorian
15:19 <+Ryozuki> "was" makes it look like its not anymore in development?
15:19 <+Ryozuki> haha
15:19 <@deen> I think DDRace was based on PPRace or something
15:19 <+Ryozuki> hmm isnt pprace a mod about portals
15:19 <@deen> then some other one, I forget names
15:19 <+Learath2> hprace maybe
15:20 <@deen> yeah
15:20 <@deen> Maybe by "was written" they mean who lead the project during that time
15:20 <+Learath2> ddrace was also written initially by 3da :P
15:20 <+Ryozuki> also idk if u saw the manpage, but he lists in the usage the client commands which to my knowledge are only used ingame/configuration files, isnt man only for command-line things?
15:20 <@deen> it fits with license.txt
15:21 <+Ryozuki> or u can do ./DDNet cl_cpu_throttle 1 directly?
15:21 <+Ryozuki> i dont think so
15:22 <+Learath2> iirc you can pass commands through argv
15:22 <+Learath2> we do it on circleci to test the server build, ./DDNet-Server shutdown
15:22 <+Ryozuki> and commands with values?
15:23 <+Ryozuki> what's the format
15:23 <+Learath2> no idea tbh, been a while since I worked on that part of the code
15:27 <+Ryozuki> "DDNet was written by Dennis Felsing and it's now maintained by the community." does this make you think that deen is no longer maintaining it? idk a good way to put it xD
15:41 <@deen> Just don't mention anything about it, who cares about who's behind it?
15:43 <@deen> yes, you can pass arguments
15:43 <@deen> ./DDNet-Server "sv_rcon_password \"foo\"; shutdown" for example
15:56 <+Ryozuki> heinrich5991, i think ddnet cmake doesn't find mysql under windows (having ddnet-libs installed), don't know if it helps but i think ur function currently searches set(DIR "ddnet-libs/${NAME}/${TARGET_OS}/lib${TARGET_BITS}") but mysql dlls on windows are not under any lib folder
15:56 <+Ryozuki> i tried putting them on lib32 and lib64 but it didnt found mysql either
15:56 <+Ryozuki> so it might not be that
15:56 <+Ryozuki> (i'm using mingw)
15:58 <+Ryozuki> it fails to find bundled mysql
