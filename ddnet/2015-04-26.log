13:33 < Nazar> Hey :)
13:34 <@deen> hi
13:47 < Nazar> V3Royal Get DDoS?
15:54 <@deen> not that I know of
16:39 < savander> deen: maybe we should add ctf5_e map ( from zcatch) to  {E}{L}{I}{T}{E} maps overview? http://ddnet.tw/mappers/-123-E-125--123-L-125--123-I-125--123-T-125--123-E-125-/
16:40 <@deen> that's ddnet maps only
16:40 <@deen> i don't plan to change it
16:40 < savander> okay
16:40 <@deen> zcatch maps don't really fit into the ranking system we have on website
16:43 < savander> ye, but i thought, it shows all maps created by user
18:42 <@deen> Tournament in 1 hour 18 minutes
18:45 < debug> Hi there
18:45 < debug> I see some player that can change the team while playing on ddnet
18:46 < debug> it is supposed to be blocked once the start line crossed, no ?
18:46 < debug> Looking at the code, if find nothing suspicious
18:46 <@deen> debug: right, maybe there is a way to go around the start line on that map?
18:46 < debug> I have been looking for that, will relook then
18:47 < debug> anyway nice work deen :)
18:47 < debug> thanks for the mod I mean ;)
18:48 < debug> deen: looking if there is a way, it's blmap pepe
18:48 < Nazar> deen?
18:49 < Nazar> deen is any 1 attacking v3royal?
18:49 <@deen> Nazar: not that I know
18:49 < Nazar> Its fucking laggy bro...
18:49 < Nazar> im stoned and want to play but its laggy much times :D
18:50 <@deen> which blmapv3royal?
18:50 < Nazar> The with Full Players
18:50 < Nazar> :D
18:50 <@deen> maybe it's some network problem?
18:50 < Nazar> Nooo, just this map
18:50 < Nazar> :D
18:51 <@deen> strange
18:51 < Nazar> look in console / chat    much gyus say  Laaag and more
18:51 < Nazar> ....
18:52 <@deen> hm, weird
18:52 <@deen> the server doesn'T look overloaded or anything
18:54 <@deen> I do see some packet loss on GER in general =/
18:54 <@deen> but i often get that, so no idea if it's Deutsche Telekom or the hoster
19:07 < Nazar> Now it lags hartd
19:08 < debug> deen, crossing start with ninja has no incidence, right ?
19:09 <@deen> debug: you can fly through start with ninja and sometimes it doesn't count as started, right
19:10 <@deen> Nazar: i hear complaints about lags on all GER servers =/
19:10 <@deen> just network problems I guess
19:12 < debug> deen, maybe that then
19:18 < debug> deen, ok that is ..
19:18 < debug> I would says 10 % chance
19:18 <@deen> yep, but i know i cheated maps like that 2 years ago ;)
19:18 <@deen> or 3

19:59 < Savander> :P
19:59 <@deen> livestream on ddnet.tw
19:59 < Savander> it count every server?
19:59 < Savander> even zcatch etc?
20:00 <@EastByte> haha
20:00 < Nimda> New DDNet peak : 740 users online at 2015-04-26 19:59:02
20:01 <@deen> yes
20:02 <@heinrich5991> deen: with live stream on the website, wow
20:03 <@EastByte> requires shitty flash
20:04 < Savander> uhm?
20:04 <@heinrich5991> deen: you have 2/3 of teeworlds players :)
20:05 <@deen> with a map that no one can play :P
20:06 < Nimda> New DDNet peak : 788 users online at 2015-04-26 20:05:02
20:07 <@EastByte> yea kinda crazy
20:07 < DoNe_> do you count the ips or the players?
20:07 <@EastByte> players in serverlist
20:07 <@EastByte> Nimda doesn't even run on deen's server
20:07 < DoNe_> so youll never hit a peak in non-dummy torunaments
20:08 <@EastByte> yea
20:08 <@heinrich5991> oh, so it's only half as many players?
20:08 < DoNe_> almost i guess
20:08 < Nimda> New DDNet peak : 794 users online at 2015-04-26 20:07:02
20:08 < DoNe_> some are spectating or playing on different servers
20:08 <@EastByte> but I like to see that the server can handle so many connections
20:10 <@EastByte> damn, I've no idea how I could make the first part in any way
20:10 < Nimda> New DDNet peak : 807 users online at 2015-04-26 20:09:02
20:12 < Nimda> New DDNet peak : 810 users online at 2015-04-26 20:11:01
20:13 <@EastByte> yep, this tournament will go over night
20:17 <@deen> Damn, missed a screenshot of 810
20:18 <@deen> that will be the max i guess, 99 more than last time, nice =)
20:18 <@EastByte> too bad :P
20:18 <@EastByte> yea awesome
20:19 <@EastByte> oh?
20:19 < DoNe_> dunno if this works xD
20:19 < DoNe_> btw im bored
20:19 < Broadcast> Super failed, nealson on GER#5 leading now!
20:19 <@EastByte> awesome :D
20:19 < DoNe_> it works :)
20:20 < Broadcast> milk is dead again as well
20:20 <@deen> oh cool
20:21 < DoNe_> well i just removed half of TeeIRC and changed a regular expression xD
20:22 < Broadcast> nealson on GER#5 is still leading!
20:24 < Broadcast> kuroyukihime on GER#2 is quite far as well
20:24 < Broadcast> and just died!
20:25 < Broadcast> But Jannis on GER#1 is at the same part
20:26 < Broadcast> Sorry for the lags!
20:26 < Broadcast> Currently having lags on GER
20:28 < Broadcast> nealson on GER#5 is quite fast and at 20% of the map!
20:32 < Broadcast> RavenXXX is having trouble on GER#4
20:34 <@heinrich5991> DoNe_: is that a TW client hooked up with the server?
20:34 < Broadcast> If you have lags on GER you could try our GER2 server
20:34 < DoNe_> its my own client xD
20:34 < Broadcast> 30 minutes are over and lots of fails so far!
20:34 < DoNe_> im too laty to code extract network functions of teeworlds
20:35 < Broadcast> Livestream on DDNet.tw is still running
20:35 < DoNe_> i would give everything for a python module that simulates a teeworlds client
20:35 <@deen> DoNe_: i have one somewhere
20:35 < DoNe_> what!?
20:35 < DoNe_> send it to me!
20:35 <@deen> oh, it was in haskell i think
20:35 <@deen> and didn't work well, so meh
20:36 < DoNe_> but its something
20:36 < DoNe_> i have nothing
20:37 < Broadcast> Loop does a bad fail
20:38 < Broadcast> milk is having trouble and RavenXXX comes up behind
20:38 < DoNe_> did you write it yourself in haskell or has it parts of c++?
20:39 <@deen> all in haskell
20:39 <@deen> i was just learning haskell, so for fun
20:39 < DoNe_> i'm haskell noob
20:39 <@EastByte> "oh, it was in haskell i think"
20:39 < Broadcast> nealson on GER#5 has the lead again!
20:40 <@EastByte> can you keep python apart from haskell? :P
20:40 < Broadcast> Nope, he fell back, now same part as milk
20:41 < Broadcast> RavenXXX nearly falls into freeze!
20:41 <@EastByte> the previous broadcast didn't reach my client on rus
20:42 <@deen> Yeah, it's a bit weird, i noticed that too sometimes
20:43 < DoNe_> i can't find motivation to learn haskell, for everything i do python is enough
20:43 <@EastByte> learning haskell is learning functional programing
20:43 < DoNe_> yea its so different
20:44 < Broadcast> nealson runs away from the competition
20:44 <@EastByte> haha
20:45 < Broadcast> milk on RUS is still behind
20:45 < Broadcast> Loop is sleeping it seems
20:46 <@EastByte> deen: do you always denounce Loop? :D
20:46 < Broadcast> nealson T'nP at 35% already
20:47 <@deen> EastByte: i consider him a potential cheater as he plays with the map tester as dummy :P
20:47 <@EastByte> kek
21:00 <@EastByte> gawd I need some popcorn

21:55 < Savander> awesome
21:56 <@deen> phew, luckily someone finished :P
21:56 < Savander> yea 
21:56 < Savander> haha, really hard map
22:01 < Nimda> DarkSpy by Spyker just released on Brutal at 2015-04-26 19:55
22:17 <@EastByte> deen: http://eastbit.net/priv/26_Apr-15-22_17.png
22:18 <@EastByte> they made it through the startline
22:18 <@deen> oh
22:18 <@deen> needs to be fixed
22:18 < WolfAlex> muhaw
22:19 < WolfAlex> EastByte: show nameplates :(
22:19 <@deen> EastByte: can you explain the bug to spyker?
22:19 <@EastByte> WolfAlex can
22:19 < WolfAlex> deen: falling down + change team while falling 
22:19 <@EastByte> he is the culprit :P
22:20 <@deen> ah
22:20 <@deen> aaah
22:21 <@deen> WolfAlex: go explain to Spyker please
22:21 <@deen> i don't get it^^
22:22 < WolfAlex> hm
22:22 <@EastByte> Spyker already knows about it
22:23 <@EastByte> "[10:23:23 PM] Spyker: they cant finish wihout pass start line"
22:23 < WolfAlex> EastByte: but they can skip the start line
22:24 <@EastByte> yep, so?
22:24 < WolfAlex> finishing is easy, since a new client could join after they are @goal and join in the same team to start the time
22:25 <@EastByte> hmm wait
22:25 <@EastByte> deen: do we have a 2pl team limit?
22:25 < WolfAlex> ah yea
22:25 < WolfAlex> but still
22:26 < WolfAlex> go to fin -> join with new player -> join into the same team -> start game with new player -> new player does selfkill -> all players in team are @goal ._.
22:27 <@EastByte> deen: does that work?
22:27 <@EastByte> nvm, Skyper is going to fix it
22:37 <@EastByte> WolfAlex: nope wouldn't work
22:38 < WolfAlex> eh why
22:38 <@EastByte> oh, depends...
22:38 < WolfAlex> will work if team is not locked
22:38 <@EastByte> normally you need a 2pl team to start
22:39 <@EastByte> and after that you can't change the team anymore
22:40 <@EastByte> but...
22:40 <@EastByte> [10:38:16 PM] Spyker: but I don't know, deen said possible to start without 1 deep tee...
22:42 <@deen> 1MB file: http://ddnet.tw/stats/807.png
22:43 <@EastByte> using vdsl50 it's just a a thumbnail :D
22:44 <@deen> milk just finished too http://ddnet.tw/tournaments/37
22:44 <@EastByte> oh nice
23:04 < WolfAlex> oh EastByte maybe not so easy
23:05 < WolfAlex> because of the switch @end
23:05 < WolfAlex> you need 3 tees to fin
23:05 < WolfAlex> one for the switch, then jump into goal, while falling another one has to start the race xd
23:14 < Learath2> anyone using two monitors on windows here ?
23:21 <@deen> nope, but works fine on linux. i'm more worried about switching to 4k and not having the nice auto-separation of 2 screens
23:22 < laxa> Learath2: I am using 3
23:22 < Learath2> laxa my desktop icons keep getting messed up on restarts :/
23:22 < Learath2> you ever encountered that ?
23:23 <@EastByte> last year I was using 3 monitors using 2 different graphicscards :D
23:23 < laxa> cause you probably shutted down not well
23:23 < laxa> it happens to me if I am not shutting down the computer nicely
23:27 < Learath2> i always use the shutdown button tho :/
23:27 < Learath2> like all the icons on my second screen goes to my main after a restart
23:27 <@deen> or your driver switches on the screens in wrong order or sth
23:28 <@deen> or switches on 2nd screen too late
23:28 <@deen> but no idea how to fix that
23:29 < Learath2> after a restart screens work for some time then they both go black i hear the new device sound and they come back up
23:29 < Learath2> that might be it
