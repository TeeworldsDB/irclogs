03:17 < bridge> <Learath2> > Reduces code complexity
03:17 < bridge> <Learath2> 😄
03:18 < bridge> <Learath2> With how spaghetti this codebase is and how people are so used to every single little quirk, `Reduces code complexity` is always a sus commit message
06:12 < bridge> <Faulty> you need to test how looks like team kill message with team of 64 ppl
06:14 < bridge> <Voxel> @Faulty
06:15 < bridge> <Faulty> ohh
06:15 < bridge> <Voxel> Jokes aside, it's going to be locked down to 4 max
08:11 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> Do you think it would look better if the players were sorted alphabetically for consistency?
09:06 < bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> I think you can do if killed players >4 then swap theirs skins like "running string"
09:06 < bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> Like that:
09:06 < bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> Skin1, Skin2, Skin3, Skin4
09:06 < bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> Skin2, Skin3, Skin4, Skin5
09:06 < bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> Skin3, Skin4, Skin5, Skin6...
09:06 < bridge> <Mʎɹ シ> And add button for toggling this "running skins" xd
09:35 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no, that's automatically done. no need to think about that
09:40 < bridge> <UnlucksMcGee> How long does the build process take, out of curiosity?
09:40 < bridge> <Ryozuki> depends highly on ur cpu
09:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for me  on release 24~ seconds
09:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 5800x
09:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> surprisingly with the M1 takes about the samew
09:41 < bridge> <Ryozuki> m1 rly is smth
09:42 < bridge> <Ryozuki> clang compiles faster btw

09:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> github changed their keys xd
09:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > At approximately 05:00 UTC on March 24 [2023], out of an abundance of caution, we replaced our RSA SSH host key used to secure Git operations for GitHub.com. We did this to protect our users from any chance of an adversary impersonating GitHub or eavesdropping on their Git operations over SSH. This key does not grant access to GitHub’s infrastructure or customer data. This change only impacts Git operations over SSH using RSA. Web traffic to Gi
10:00 < bridge> <deen> you have to compare compilation for same arch though, the optimiations for arm are probably faster than for x86-64
10:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> yeah
10:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> clang  is faster for me on gentoo
10:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i didnt try gcc on m1 xD
10:01 < bridge> <deen> I just got a Ryzen 7 7700 for work, quite happy so far. But no cpu temp sensor support on Linux yet is scary
10:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> oof
10:01 < bridge> <Ryozuki> did they just hand the cpu ? the motherboards for am5 are quite costly too xD
10:02 < bridge> <deen> i‘m just renting a hetzner server with it
10:02 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ah
10:02 < bridge> <deen> don‘t want the noise and heat at home, i just need a terminal anyway
10:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> xD
10:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i expected this from you
10:03 < bridge> <deen> it‘s pretty cheap https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ax52
10:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i have one with hetzner, 3600 iirc
10:03 < bridge> <Ryozuki> 45€ month
10:04 < bridge> <Ryozuki> for now im happy xD
11:52 < bridge> <Robyt3> But if any other files e.g. in the data folder were changed, then `make` does not copy them to the data folder in the build folder. If a `.dll` was changed then they are not copied either, so the bisect can give incorrect results if the issue is related to a library update.
12:54 < bridge> <Learath2> Ah RSA only, that's why I never got the warning
14:00 <+ChillerDragon> wotefek happend to my broadcast xd
14:00 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1679832023.png
14:02 <+ChillerDragon> motd*
14:04 < bridge> <Robyt3> Same was just posted in #bugs and also previously by @Voxel. Should be fixed with the above PR. Only seems to happen sometimes, maybe when specific HUD elements are shown.
14:05 <+ChillerDragon> oh so its a ddnet bug ah i see
14:05 <+ChillerDragon> @Zwelf when bridge github prs and #bugs channel? hehe
14:05 <+ChillerDragon> i guess github is bridged but not to irc :c

16:23 < bridge> <судный день.> ex rc1
16:23 < bridge> <судный день.> ez*
16:24 < bridge> <судный день.> wow 128 player ssupport
16:24 < bridge> <судный день.> interesting
16:25 < bridge> <heinrich5991> oh, that sounds like a bug in the CMakeLists.txt 😦
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> ryo xd ur meme made me giggle
19:38 < bridge> <судный день.> russian is most updated :p
19:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Russians also need it the most \:p
21:05 < bridge> <Chairn> damn, @Robyt3 carrying version 16.9 on his own
21:18 < bridge> <Voxel> nice
21:18 < bridge> <Voxel> so, if i were to incorperate teamstates into client-sided code, would i need to send a net message for that?
21:21 < bridge> <Voxel> or is there a way to bring server-sided code into client-sided code without adding another netmsg?
22:10 < bridge> <Ravie> @Voxel client and server are separate things so if you want to get any info between them it has to be sent, unless the thing you want is already being sent somewhere you need to add it
