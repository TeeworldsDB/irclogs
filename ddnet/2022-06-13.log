00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I still use autocrlf true on windows, I don't trust windows not to put their nasty CR everywhere
00:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i think i'll just try to stay on wsl as often as possible
00:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i thought autocrlf false would prevent crlf line endings? or auto overwrite to lf
01:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> autocrlf to true and safecrlf to false
01:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> okay
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <P.J.> Player hours graph doesn't look too nice on mobile. Don't know if that is worth a bug just wanted to share.
08:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <P.J.> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/985800070337277972/Screenshot_2022-06-13-08-56-16-374_com.android.chrome.jpg
09:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> You never crashed your PC with a rogue C++ app? xD
09:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> I made a bouncy sound, but please ask pipou xD
09:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> Can I post it here?
09:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/985807092617211974/slime.mp3
09:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks, will check later
09:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hes in here @Pipou
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but i can give feedback too
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think its a bit too high frequency for smth bouncy
09:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe try to get more low end to give it the 'smush' sound effect
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> oh and dampen the reverb a bit
09:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <hus3h> added a fix for it in my pr
11:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I think i only had GPU driver crashes yet
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0166> I tried to compile ddnet and I got an error that it cannot find avcodec-59.dll, swscale-6.dll, avformat-59.dll
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how did you get the source code?
11:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you downloaded the ddnet-libs submodule?
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0166> yes
11:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you compile ddnet?
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0166> With this commands:
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0166> mkdir build
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0166> cd build
11:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0166> cmake ..
11:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you post the exact error message?
11:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> it's very simple: make a thread start a synchronous and asynchronous version of itself (and forget the end condition 😢 )
11:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0166> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/985844375655424050/unknown.png
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you have successfully compiled it, just running doesn't work?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0166> I launched it 1 time and the hereditary day does not start
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could try copying over these libraries from ddnet-libs/ffmpeg/windows/lib64/
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <racolover2314> Hey
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <racolover2314> Sup
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <racolover2314> do you guys have female friends?
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> when you include the wrong protocol.h and nothing compiles anymore xD
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> I always find development bugs funny, so here is one for you: I used the wrong image and now my skid marks are emojis
13:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/985868705344933938/screenshot_2022-06-13_13-29-31.png
13:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @0166 ^
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> why does it look so photoshoped? xD
14:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> tbh it looks like tippex on the monitor
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Nouaa probably an app that recognizes text and makes it more readable
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> was thinking 'bout that, but the font also seems weird xd
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> u're probably right
14:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I was thinking it looked a lot like google translate
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0166> no it is translate
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> @Learath2 huh didn't notice that the text might be odd, might be it I guess :)
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> oh ^^
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> thanks, fixed
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> do you want that I run fix style for you?
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> @c0d3d3v Is it possible to give me a branch on ddnet? My Latest PR is based on another one and the code looks inflated. This could make reviewing easier
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> you can just make a branch on your fork.
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> git checkout -b your_branch_name
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where can I find the skin db code?
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @heinrich5991  how about this https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/pull/193/files
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lets just allow indexed rgb
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nobody cares about old clients
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I kinda do
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nobody - you
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or +
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> indexed rgbs are smaller, so why prevent useful stuff
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wanted to explore that
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how much smaller are indexed rgbs, does it justify the skin db no longer working for older clients
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it still works
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> just not the indexed RGB skins
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it justify the skin db no longer working for the indexed rgb skins for old clients
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Mʎɹ シ> How I can add custom sprite for my client?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5404
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> @heinrich5991  this would leed to overflow in old clients. Do you want this? Do we want to drop support for old clients? 
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> becuase of https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L700
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> left non indexed
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> right indexed
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/985925658989453382/unknown.png
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> on Ablush NeoN.png
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> thanks, you were way faster than me on that one 🙂
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u want to reproduce:
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> changed type in gimp
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ran zopfli on both
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> as far as I can tell, this doesn't lead to any overflow, clients only read as many tune params as they know: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/5a7fa108a6ab735f6c7a9fe061245297ca6367c4/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L692-L701
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> This is not what I meant?!
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you still see an overflow, please point me to it
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> This is not what I meant, I just wanted reviews for you easier
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it's fine to just base your PRs on top of others. we can look at just the new commits
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> mh I see
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> It might get messy at some point when I modify the base PR more and start merging it back in
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> try rebasing instead ^^
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> All of this is a bit of trial and error unfortunatly
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> hmm okay
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (instead of merging back)
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> that's the first time I see why rebasing is useful
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> now it clicked on my why it's named `rebasing`
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> now it clicked on me why it's named `rebasing`
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also, not a large issue, but for future pull requests, you could consider squashing commits like https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5313/commits/0c5f98a41e10e7863c5336173fd803bcfe4460dc
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> ah sorry 😄 I forgot that you are AssassinTee ... Now I understand
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not much information is added by having that as a separate commit. if we only have commits that correspond to semantic changes, it eases git-blaming
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Assa> can you rename me here? I would do it myself but the server doesn't allow it <.<
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Essigautomat since the last two commits became superfluous, you could practice rebasing by doing a `git rebase -i upstream/master` keeping the first commit, squashing the second one into the first one and deleting the other two of this pull request: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5398
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> superfluous: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5404
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Not Keks I guess the question boils down to: do we want to support old clients for the skin db
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if we want to do that, we need to ensure compatibility
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then i vote no xd
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> idc about outdated software
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> What does deleting do?
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if we don't, sooner or later indexed rgb skins will get added, or people might get the idea that indexed rgba skins are smaller and can thus be replaced
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sounds like a good step to me 😄
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think the delete command is called "drop" in `git rebase -i`
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it just removes the commit and its changes
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> next drop vanilla support and add map images as PNG instead of zlib
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok its more about old clients actually
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> since 0.7 have own map files
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with that in mind, I can see why my comments are seen as unnecssary burden ^^
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> cant we add a warning in next release to update the client and trigger it in exactly 1 year
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> then we have some spearroom
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wouldn't intentionally make old software not work, but I guess one could say that adding a warning doesn't make the software not work
17:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> is this a good way to get mod type in the hud or whats the best source?
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh depends
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> bcs i didnt see it how to get the ggametype out of this at the first glance
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> are entities always related to the hud
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> could probs argue yes, but maybe also no
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> dunno
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ask fokkonaut, he abuses all these flags xd
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> if you have another idea pls tell me
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ok, yeah sounds like abuse or hacky way
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i am also not the right person to ask network questions xd
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> cause entities rely on gametype so why not go to the "root source"
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> ok
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> > and deleting the other two of this pull request
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> this was requested by codedev 😮
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, I think he was mistaken
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> off
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> see here
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @cauldron you can add another flag if you want
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> alternatively, why not hide that part of the score board if it's empty? @cauldron
17:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Learath2 if it makes u happy, the skin database runs better on firefox than chrome, firefox seems to struggle less creating the 600 skins table
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can anyone here write something for the discord bot? just to autoadd reactions in the new skin submission channel
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I have no experience with the discord bot, I don't know anyone who does
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe Learath2
17:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> yeah i asked learath as well
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> I already linked you to the gameinfo in your PR... just add a flag there
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can we maybe just render the ones on screen? 600 is a lot
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or paginate it
17:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah could do lots of stuff xd lets see if the performance hit comes from the tee.js
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> @heinrich5991 dev just added a commit 2 minutes ago and now I overwrote history 🙈 is he here?
17:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Firefox supremacy
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> If you mean def-, that's me
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> mh I really don't feel like it, what does it need to do?
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> then I mean you, I didn't know your github name 😄
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> can you see #📬submit-skins
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> off
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> it needs to add 2 reactions to any messages in there with a skin file and the correct name
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think you should be able to copy/paste a lot from map_submissions.py
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> do we have plugins for that on the website alraedy?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> 
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there is a javascript library: datatables, but it requires jquery, dunno if that bloats stuff too much
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Not Keks hm, it's too fast for me to detect any slowdown, how did you figure chrome fared worse than firefox?
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no plugins
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe jquery supports it, we use some jquery stuff
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for me it doesn'T even load all skins
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/ae1876d1414cb013554db3ed839425a9647a4fc2/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L1012
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> like this, 
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> "Info.m_ShowGameGoals = Vanilla || FNG || ..."
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <c0d3d3v> guessing it from the mod flags https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/ae1876d1414cb013554db3ed839425a9647a4fc2/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L989-L998 should be fine
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i don't see it
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> every time I refresh a different subset of skins is shown
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, if I clear the cache while reloading I do get some missing too
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but if I refresh again since the skin images are cached it renders all just fine
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I haven't taken a look at the code btw, so dunno why the GET request for the image ending late causes this
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah yeah the tee.js thing is weird it should trigger only when the image is actually shown
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> off
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The intersection observer api could probably be used there, or maybe lazy loading combined with the onload event? I might take a look in a couple hours
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Essigautomat now you combined the two later commits into the first one, instead of dropping them. do you want me to fix it or do you want to try yourself?
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (in https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5398)
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah good to know, i dunno all dom events
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> else i gonna just create a image map
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> might be faster anyway
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> please fix it, I also clashed with @deen there
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> and doesnt create this weird flashing
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Essigautomat done. it seems your git identity isn't connected to github btw
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you might want to add your git email address to your profile
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> My account is really really old, this might be the reason why. I fixed it
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Github also provides a noreply forwarding email if you'd rather not have your email public
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> My account is really really old, this might be the reason why. I fixed it. And thank you ofc ❤️
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I connected my spam email address, which is 13 years old and already got hacked twice
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually calling it "noreply" is very wrong. It's just a forwarding email :D
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> now that I modified the PR, can someone else merge it? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5398
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, maybe hold off of it for a moment, there might be identity issues ^^
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Uff, new physics, I don't feel comfortable merging it without reviewing it myself anyway
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hehe
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 identity issues solved
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm busy for atleast an hour. I've been putting off studying since the morning, I'll feel bad if I don't atleast study some italian
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> ti amo @Learath2 (and that's all the Italian I learned)
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can say "ciao"
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Buonissimo
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm learning the wonderful world of italian prepositions and how they lack all rhyme and reason
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You just memorize what preposition is supposed to be used with what noun
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds like most languages 😛
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to be operated on something
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> to think of
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> How do I dilate images again?
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> hm
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> drag the file into dilate.exe
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <bencie> (same directory as ddnet.exe is in)
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> (yeah had to build it first)
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> off
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> @heinrich5991 did you test the bouncyness ingame or do you just trust me?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I trust you
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the changes looked sane and I think I've experimented with the already built-in bounciness before
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> you can break it with values > 1.0 and < 1.0, that's why I am asking
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> you can break it with values > 1.0 and < -1.0, that's why I am asking
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmm ^^
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> break with >1.0 because you get faster and faster?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what happens with <-1.0?
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> yes, make a 1 tile gab with bouncy walls and see how your acceleration clips you through walls
18:41 <+ChillerDragon> btw i squashes @heinrich
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> yes, make a 1 tile gab with bouncy walls and see how your acceleration clips you through walls with elasticity_x > 1.0
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> with exactly -1.0 walls get sticky, it's actually a funny effect, because walls try to pull you into them. If you make this value higher, you get more and more accelerated into the wall clipping through it in the process
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmm
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon ?
18:42 <+ChillerDragon> da
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> wdym?
18:43 <+ChillerDragon> u asked me to squash the nullptr pr
18:43 <+ChillerDragon> i just did
18:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
18:45 <+ChillerDragon> road to -Weverything :D
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `-Weverything` isn't useful
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> except maybe learning more warnings to enable
18:46 <+ChillerDragon> yea iv seen u write tha
18:46 <+ChillerDragon> but i think it would be cool to pass Weverything
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> some warnings aren't applicable to our code
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> if you like a `-Wall` of text, sure :p
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fixing them for the sake of passing `-Weverything` doesn't sound beneficial
18:47 <+ChillerDragon> hrmpf
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `-Wall` actually means "activate a conservative, always useful set of warnings"
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `-Wextra` means "activate a usually useful set of warnings" ^^
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> that's `-Wonderful` :p
18:48 <+ChillerDragon> lul
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> e.g. `-Wpadded` "Warn if padding is included in a structure"
18:48 <+ChillerDragon> and wats Weverything? activate as much as u can no matter the usefulness
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't sound useful to forbid entirely
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `-Weverything` is "enable literally all warnings, even those that aren't actually useful for anyone"
18:49 <+ChillerDragon> well ill try to fix the nullptr thing and then if im still motivate ill check if others are cool or not
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Essigautomat should I stop the merge or should it be fixed in a followup PR?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> how can we fix that, aren't all tuning values broken at some point? Do we have limits somewhere or do I need to clamp that every time I use it?
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> could theoretically clamp it in `MoveBox` I guess
18:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I once made a PR to put sane limits on all tuning values, but it wasn’t accepted iirc
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> stop the merge, I'll clamp them
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> done
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> how can I pull your changes of this branch?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have your own branch currently checked out?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> yes
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `git fetch origin`
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and no local changes?
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `git reset --hard origin/features/elasticity-tuning`
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> `$ git reset --hard origin/feature/elasticity-tuning
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> fatal: ambiguous argument 'origin/feature/elasticity-tuning': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
19:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> `
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you show me the output of `git remote -v` (or tell me how you call your github.com/AssassinTee/ddnet remote)?
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> ah, this remote is named upstream (to add to my own confusion). I just fetched the branch with `git fetch origin pull/5398/head:BRANCHNAME` and see, that the commit hashes are identical now
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> great 🙂
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (upstream is usually the thing not controlled by you btw ^^)
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's "further up the stream"
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> I know, but swapping them was too much effort 😢
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `git remote rename origin temp; git remote rename upstream origin; git remote rename temp upstream`
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i was going to do it if you don't want to use regex to fasten it
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> @heinrich5991 when I pull the PR I get hash 2435c72, which is right according to https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5398/commits, however if I take a look at collision.cpp the changes are gone
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> @heinrich5991 when I pull the PR I get hash 2435c72, which is right according to <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/5398/commits>, however if I take a look at collision.cpp the changes are gone
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's the output of `git rev-parse HEAD`?
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> Okay I searched for elasticity and was in MovePoint and not in MoveBox 🤦‍♂️
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> great 🙂
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> is this a bug? xD
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/985957700963815465/Ddnet_2022.06.13_-_19.21.54.01.mp4
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> 185.11.142.197:8314 if someone want to try
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> wrong channel btw, sorry
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> @heinrich5991 done 😅
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Nouaa good old sp someone trick
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> yeah xD
20:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <AssassinTee> Today I learned that my IDE has a "Resolve Simple Conflicts" button when rebasing. Best feature ever.
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is the hours played based on actual hours or just finishes?
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hours played in any teeworlds server
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u get that with teehistorian or a new thing?
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> missed a lot of stuff :poggers:
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> apparently from master stats
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its accurate down to 5 seconds of error
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder what would be the math way to calculate the min and max possible hours
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> given that
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> min (rather infimum) = 0 secs
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> max (rather supremum) = all the time
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it possible to miss all the checks if u are all the time on?
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> isnt that paradoxical
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, you only leave for a very short time frame around the report
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> and you can also do the reverse
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only join for an arbitrarily short time frame around the report
20:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true

20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> soon we will have all the tools in rust and modernized
20:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we just need new distros to ship them by default

20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> github added a badge for prs
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oof
20:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> too much gamification
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Learath2 can you explain me wtf is happening here?
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i can select it for 1 frame, then it disappears
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its not even electron xD
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/985981708841144430/d.mp4
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> after reload it works again xd
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> is this bcs webkit sucks? ^^
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> nah
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> weird solo
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> nothing more
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> It's because discord in general sucks
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's because web is an absolute mess, no rhyme or reason to it, it's just a mishmash of badly interacting features
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wait until we get CSS4 with it's Selectors Level 4 spec
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @Learath2 what do u think about react or nextjs?
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> besides bloat
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which part of it? I don't like it's very rigid way of doing things
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> like hooks?
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I do like the idea of a virtual dom to avoid the inefficiency of the web
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> why is a virtual dom more efficient than a real dom?
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> naively, it sounds like doubled work
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well its javascript vs javascript
21:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> not javascript vs other stuff
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> react hooks forces you do only rerender stuff if the state actually changes
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> that's why its often considered more elegant
21:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i dont have benchmarks to back me up 😄
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but i assume since react with typescript and JSX has a compiler and no textual DOM changes, it might also optimize stuff better
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> What is the configuration of a fng server? Is there a forum where everything is marked?
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> u dont do stuff like innerHTML += "<iamhtmlstringxd />"
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> own server?
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i explained most stuff in the config in my fng version
21:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://github.com/Jupeyy/teeworlds-fng2-mod/blob/fng_06/fng.cfg
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> Thanks u pro
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <badoumed> KeoS told me about a command that allows the fng server to be more fluid, you see what he is talking about
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> sv_high_bandwidth 1
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> wtf i wrote "off" once, then i put my phone in pocket. now i see lots of offs
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> i just used the first approach that came into my mind. but i dont know how to do this. as i understand the hud its just things rendered on top of eachother. i have no adhoc idea how to know in the renderspechud() function if the "goalshud" is empty.
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @cauldron check the RenderGoals function. it only renders something if specific conditions are met
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> if i just hide the goalshud the spechud doesnt resize. ill have to put those conditions there too.
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> checking gamemod is less thinking.
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but i dont know whats better
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> if i just hide the goalshud the spechud doesnt resize. ill have to put those conditions there too to resize.
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> checking gamemod is less thinking.
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cauldron> but i dont know whats better
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Not Keks for the skin license stuff
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> do you want us to encourage people to add a license?
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> was patigas idea, i think licenses are useless stuff
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> okay i will give the option to include it i guess
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lol
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> was searching discord, focuses this chat bar
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i think adding skin is broken in db
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> useless webkit
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/986004281670897714/unknown.png
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> thats all that shows
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> mhh
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i only tested it on php 8
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> hope that isnt a problem
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> i think the whole website is broken rn
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ah nvm i have outdated site again
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> thanks cloudflare
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> btw @louis someone suggested to sort by release date default, do you agree?
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or keep alphabet
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> just keep alphabet imo, cause you can always click on release date to see newest
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @deen are the permissions correct?
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> as said in the pr it now uses php for everything instead of .sh scripts
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> or can u enable php error output?
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> this is how it should look like
22:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/986005683872870421/unknown.png
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> try again
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> @louis ^
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> could it be that i'm entering my skin db password incorrectly?
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> i still get nothing
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> nah
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> if u see the site u entered it correct
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> hopefully its not some php8 thing
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> how do u add it btw?
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/986006861692149850/unknown.png
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> like that
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> ok looks correct
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> well i cannot help here sry, can just tell localhost works fine, no idea whats wrong :/
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @louis what is the issue?
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> after i click add skin it goes to this page
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> with no script output
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function str_ends_with() in /var/www/skins/edit/modify_skin.php:136
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 321892 Stack trace:
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 321893 #0 /var/www/skins/edit/modify_skin.php(359): DoSkinAction()``` could this be it?
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, we have php7.4 that function is php8
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen could we feasibly upgrade to php8 or should I replace the str_ends_with?
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @louis try again pls
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> still doesn't output anything
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Ah thanks for debugging
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another php8 function 😄 let me shim that too
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> str_contains
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> I just had the php manual open didn't think about versioning
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @louis can you give it one more go pls
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd want to bump up to php8 but not sure if the forum will explode
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/986012496374673499/unknown.png
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> no output now
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @louis soz, missed a ')' should work now
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> still no script output
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> maybe another php8 function hiding kek
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Why are str functions even php8 xd
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @louis once more pls, also lmk if you get bored
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> php is an old ass language that used to believe "if there is a way to do it, there is no need to add a nicer name for it"
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> ok it works
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Xd
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `str_contains` is basically just `strpos`, `str_ends_with` is basically `substr_compare`
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> at least i think it does
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> U might have to use Ctrl shift r
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> On the site
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Not Keks uhhh when i add a UHD skin
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> does it need to have a different name
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> No same
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should probably use something like composer and get `symfony/polyfills` if we have to stick to php7.4
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> okaay
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cauase the script said
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/986014409598070845/unknown.png
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> removing old skin with same name
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> so i thought it replaced it
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> but i guess it didn't
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 i think php8.1 depends on libc6 2.33 but debian bullseye only has 2.31
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> It replaced the uhd false state to true
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> skin renderer dieded
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Warnings generally can be ignored in the script. They are just to highlight what's important
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep, skin renderer did dieded
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> Probably cloud flare
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> For some reason it aggressively caches tee.js
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> fine now
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> status is death too
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wtf
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I didn't touch that
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> 😄
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nor do I really know how status even works
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/937521106863140864
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> seems status fixed itself
