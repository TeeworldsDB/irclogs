07:51 < grenadepro> hey guys , what time ddnet-scripts will be upgraded ?
10:01 <@deen> grenadepro: when I feel like it, I do it manually
10:01 <@deen> since we have our own internal repo. would probably be nicer to properly use the ddnet-scripts repo
10:08 < grenadepro> ok sorry I had no intention of
10:16 <@deen> you don't need it?
10:48 < grenadepro> need what ?
10:49 < grenadepro> i didnt want unhappy you , so forgot it .
11:38 < grenadepro> heinrich5991: hi, what happend for teewrolds.com ?
11:56 <@deen> grenadepro: < minus> update: outage is caused by a hardware failure; investigation is underway
12:28 < grenadepro> ok
20:51 <+Ryozuki> deen, you could announce all insane finishes on discord since they arent usual
22:50 <@deen> Ryozuki: well, and then also 5 star solo maps etc etc?
22:59 <@deen> I'd just do every map with 30 points or more
22:59 <@deen> But even for today 16 finishes on Insane maps, 4 top ranks today
22:59 <@deen> So 16 might be a bit much for discord
23:01 <@deen> So you need to make Insane harder, then I'd consider it
23:01 <@deen> if it's < 10 finishes a day
23:20 <+Ryozuki> today cuz we did a big team but i doubt its common
23:23 <+nameless1> Ryozuki: nice one!
23:23 <+Ryozuki> ty
23:23 <+Ryozuki> we were about 20
23:23 <+Ryozuki> not all finished tho, some dummies failed
23:24 <+nameless1> we lost 1 dummy too :)
23:24 <+Ryozuki> https://ddnet.tw/ranks/insane/
23:24 <+Ryozuki> see last finishes 
23:24 <+Ryozuki> xD
23:24 <+nameless1> Yea I saw
23:26 <+nameless1> Why am I nameless1? I was just nameless. Maybe because of reconnect? Hm...
23:27 < nameless-tee> Oh. I'm nameless-tee now. Ok.
