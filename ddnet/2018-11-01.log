16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> Hi
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> How do I enable /points command in my private server?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> And why doesn't ranks save in DataBase:
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> 
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> sv_use_sql 1
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> add_sqlserver r teeworlds record teeworlds "MyPW "localhost" "3306"
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> add_sqlserver w teeworlds record teeworlds "MyPW "localhost" "3306"
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> 
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> I did this as it mentioned in github
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> but it seems that it doesn't work
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> 
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> also when I execute command /points it says that there's no such command and I get this output after running DDNet-Server:
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> 
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> [2018-11-01 10:38:14][console]: No such command: sv_use_sql.
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> [2018-11-01 10:38:14][console]: No such command: add_sqlserver.
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> [2018-11-01 10:38:14][console]: No such command: add_sqlserve
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rockus> how to recompile new entities?
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> entities are image files u dont need to recompile to change them
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> replace the files + relaunch tw
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TcTc you need to compile the server with mysql support
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> @Learath2 How do I do that
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> Could u give me CMake command in order to do that?
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^ aside from images of read/unread forums (soon), tried my best
17:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> even if bit late, maybe will work in next year xd
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Soreu nice work, btw it would be even better if u made the text have more contrast with the gray (maybe make it more white) and i also think the titles dont outstand to much
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/507588294549307393/unknown.png
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Soreu news is a h2 while happy halloween is a h3
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen thanks for the invite :)
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @Ryozuki they neither did outstand much w/o halloween theme ^^
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> 
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/507589316273242142/unknown.png
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :/
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> And about the contrast - it also sucks in few places on forum, but I don't really have more time to play around with it, so feel free to have fun with that ðŸ˜›
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :O
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ill try to improve it
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> someone mention me once the PR will be merged please, so i will finish things with the theme
17:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ^ thx
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki the idea is that you don't have to wait for my review to submit the change log ðŸ˜„
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜®
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I scped it over, how to enable it?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok, got it
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but looks like it doesn't work
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> just noticed
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TcTc https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet#building-on-linux-and-macos
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> And I'm wondering why
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it says version 3.2.0 instead of 3.2.3?
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe that's why
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or some css is missing?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> every single file from prosilver should be used except few that are overridden by enabled child (Halloween)
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> weird thing
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> also funny that it says 3.2.0 while I downloaded the prosilver from repo
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe repo was outdated
21:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <â™ªâ™«> btw 11.4.5 sound broken on windows confirmed
21:43 <+breton> who cares about windows pfff
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> Hi. How can I set that server renames it self when someone calls a vote to change server mode for instance. DDNet Ger - Solo [DDRaceNetwork] when we vote to Brutal, It renames to DDNet Ger - Brutal [DDRaceNetwork]
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TcTc Make the vote run multiple commands. In DDNet we use a reset file for that: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/types/brutal/flexvotes.cfg
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> the reset file is executed when a map is changed
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps/blob/master/types/moderate/votes.cfg#L2
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and then the reset file looks like that: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/types/brutal/flexreset.cfg
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> (if you don't want the link to expand u can use <> around it)
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> top5 -1 is reverse sorted
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> is it wanted behaviour?
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> @deen It does change server name automatically to DDGer {Mode} [DDraceNetwork]
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> But it doesn't do that in my server which I compiled from ddnet source
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TcTc> And how can i active emote's sound ?
