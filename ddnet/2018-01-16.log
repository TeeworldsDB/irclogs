03:12 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <heinrich5991> floating point is worse than I thought and worse than what they taught me at uni

08:32 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <deen> > If your network protocol or save game format stores only user inputs then you must have absolute determinism.

17:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> did the new zooming possibly break sv_gfx_text_overlay?
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> did the new zooming possibly break cl_gfx_text_overlay?
17:57 <+ddnet-discord> [discord] <timakro> did the new zooming possibly break gfx_text_overlay?
