10:00 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> same error but it says ipv4 üò¶
10:09 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i try open dmz and not working
10:12 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> wait
10:12 < bridge_> <WarHammer> i got this error too yesterday
10:12 < bridge_> <WarHammer> im using linux, although i let firewall, it didnt work
10:12 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i fix this error
10:12 < bridge_> <WarHammer> do u use windows?
10:12 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i used linux but now windows
10:13 < bridge_> <WarHammer> u fixed right ?
10:13 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> yes
10:13 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> now i fixed
10:13 < bridge_> <WarHammer> How
10:13 < bridge_> <WarHammer> i used to open servers but now it dont work
10:13 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> wait my english bad i forgot a word
10:13 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> ill translate
10:14 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> Allow ddnet.exe from firewall
10:14 < bridge_> <WarHammer> :)
10:14 < bridge_> <WarHammer> Linux
10:14 < bridge_> <WarHammer> And i let on linux too
10:15 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> and create a new entry rule
10:15 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i remember linux has a firewall
10:15 < bridge_> <WarHammer> Ye
10:15 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> okay
10:15 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> how i did forgot
10:15 < bridge_> <WarHammer> ok bro dont mind, thank you for help
10:16 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> no
10:16 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> ill help
10:16 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> im looking
10:16 < bridge_> <WarHammer> No its okay i dont have to open server
10:16 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> Create the new arrivals from firewall
10:16 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> name is ddnet port or something
10:17 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> allow
10:17 < bridge_> <WarHammer> i already did
10:17 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> and write 8303(ddnet port)
10:17 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> select udp
10:17 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> uh
10:17 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> try open dmz
10:17 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> on your router
10:17 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> if dont work close
10:18 < bridge_> <WarHammer> ill try
10:18 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> okay
10:28 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> how can i choose my server location Turkey
10:56 <+ChillerDragon> lul i think one can modify the client to send 9 less bytes when only walking around without breaking server compatibility
11:36 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> how can i ban people on my server console says ban    s[ip|id] ?i[minutes] r[reason]
11:37 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> how i can take people ip
11:37 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i cant
11:37 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i write nickname says invalid ip|id
11:37 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> anybody can sent example ban text
11:41 < bridge_> <Alexander> Instead of the name you write their id
11:46 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> how i can their id
11:46 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> idk
11:47 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i need find their id
11:49 < bridge_> <bencie> "status" in rcon shows both id and IP (ip only if show_ips is 1)
11:49 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> how
11:49 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i dont understand
11:50 < bridge_> <bencie> status
11:50 < bridge_> <bencie> type that in console
11:50 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> i need write status
11:50 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> okay
11:50 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> thanks
11:50 < bridge_> <bencie> For IDs: cl_show_ids 1
11:50 < bridge_> <bencie> in f1
11:50 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> its look 0 1 2 3 4
11:50 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> right?
11:50 < bridge_> <bencie> This will show IDs in chat and scoreboard
11:50 < bridge_> <bencie> Ayes
11:50 < bridge_> <bencie> That's id
11:50 < bridge_> <Itachi-kun> ayo thanks bro
12:13 < afterfx> test
12:33 < bridge_> <DefaultO> You bring me to ideas. Are these bytes unecessary? Animation maybe?
15:02 <+ChillerDragon> No the bytes are not unecessary they are used for hook/fire/weapon state etc
15:03 <+ChillerDragon> but if you only want to update your direction you should be able to only send that. And the vanilla client always sends all inputs even the ones that were unchanged.
15:04 <+ChillerDragon> but the client also sends a size field and the server only reads in size amount of inputs and direction is the first
15:29 < bridge> <Learath2> https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/01/20/types-announcement.html cool news
15:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> 5 days ago :p
15:30 < bridge> <Learath2> ok I'm slow üò≠
15:34 <+ChillerDragon> wow types 
15:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i posted it
15:38 < bridge> <Ryozuki> next time grep me kek
15:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but its good to know u follow rust news
15:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> slowly converting
15:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> cool project:
15:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> da rust cult
15:48 <+ChillerDragon> ffmpeg in rust when?
15:48 < bridge> <KDaniel> did someone build a max limit of skins in the last version?
15:49 < bridge> <KDaniel> i got a message who says he cant start the client because he has near 1k skins
15:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The only maximum is your hardware limits
15:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/capabilities-1/
15:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> interesting concept
16:44 < bridge> <KDaniel> ok, weird. he can play with it but since the new update he just can use close to 100 because only 4k skins and gpu say out of vram
16:46 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> How I can take blue tick
16:46 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> On my server
16:48 < bridge> <Ryozuki> u cant
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why does he need 4k skins on full hd monitor?
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 4k skins are for 32k monitor
16:49 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> U can use 7000 skins with 2gb vram targeting full hd
16:50 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Except a very few exceptions all ppl have this
16:51 < bridge> <KDaniel> yea i know üôÇ i dont do this but i try to explain it to him
16:58 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> Why üò≠
16:58 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> Every server on turkey has blue tick
17:00 < bridge> <Chairn> https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/12/13/compute-is-easy-memory-is-harder-and-harder/
17:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And still memory scales much better than(esp) single core performance, which is still required by most apps
17:05 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> @Jupeyy_Keks do you know how take blue tick
17:06 < bridge> <bencie> you cant xd only official servers
17:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Make your mod open source and let ddnet host it
17:06 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> how i can open source
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Github
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Gitlab
17:07 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> okay than ill ddnet host it right?
17:07 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> idk how ddnet host my server
17:07 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Maybe. I'm not related to ddnet org
17:08 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> .
17:08 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> i wanna be official
17:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Ask an admin I guess
17:08 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> @Learath2
17:09 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> can you help me
17:09 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> i wanna let ddnet host it but idk how its that i make
17:27 < bridge> <KDaniel> btw the problem is since 16.7 older versions like 16.5 running fine like we tested now together. 
17:27 < bridge> <KDaniel> is it maybe a problem since rust is implemented?
17:27 < bridge> <WarHammer> @Itachi-kun
17:28 < bridge> <WarHammer> T√ºrk m√ºs√ºn?
17:28 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> evet

17:29 < bridge> <Itachi-kun> sorry
17:29 < bridge> <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki why you bored?
17:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> that was my mood when i wrote that
17:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but well im often bored
17:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> thats life
17:30 < bridge> <Ryozuki> why? xd
17:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> dunno. I read it and was wondering why
17:33 < bridge> <Learath2> It‚Äôs not a mod, he is hosting a normal ddnet server. Why would we host that?
17:39 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the whole convo is confusion cuz bad english
17:41 < bridge> <Learath2> And I‚Äôm not in the mood to talk turkish üòõ
17:47 <+ChillerDragon> racist lerato
17:53 < bridge> <DefaultO> le üêÄ
17:54 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> no its bcs vulkan is default backend, which doesnt allow going over your VRAM limits and ddnet loads all skins at start, no lazy loading
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but its a good way to finally get rid of all these 4k textures
17:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> sad that they spread at all
18:02 < bridge> <Chairn> what you mean with "scale"? Because you seem to compare multiple memory devices with a single core
18:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the article sounds like it wants to say we slowly reach the limits of memory capabilities
18:03 < bridge> <Chairn> which is not the case in your opinion?
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i only read like 5 setences, because then my attention span for such articles is over
18:04 < bridge> <Chairn> it's not the capacity the issue, it's bandwidth and latency
18:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah i think we are still pretty far away, ofc that doesnt mean it will not get slower (e.g. slow bus speed / more latency)
18:04 < bridge> <KDaniel> ahh this could be the solution for his problem. 
18:05 < bridge> <KDaniel> but yea good point to do it now do get rid of it.... 
18:05 < bridge> <KDaniel> the problem is there will be more and more people who want it and use it not less
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but usually u dont need all your memory at once tho, did the article give an example?
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but for what exactly do they want it. where does their desire come from?
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 4k skins dont solve any problem
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they are as said for 32k monitors
18:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i never seen a 32k monitor in my life
18:06 < bridge> <KDaniel> i dont know its just like that xD i dont use 4k skins
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> u have to understand that most GPUs are simply not build for this
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> the texture might live in very unoptimal buffers on the VRAM
18:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it can create laggs / less performance, in worst case regular stuttering
18:06 < bridge> <Chairn> simple math kernels are enough to reach bandwidth and latency limits, meaning the cpu is idle for a good portion of time
18:07 < bridge> <Chairn> bunny hopping in graph structure is also a way to reach those limits
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so whats the solution? better software?
18:08 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean it was the case in 1990 too
18:09 < bridge> <Chairn> nah, wasn't the case in 1990 üôÇ
18:09 < bridge> <Chairn> that's what the guys says
18:10 < bridge> <Chairn> better software and/or better architecture
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so apple like architectures
18:10 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> where everything lives close to each other
18:10 < bridge> <Chairn> maybe, i don't know apple architectures
18:10 < bridge> <Chairn> im more into pear reviewed architectures
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> everything that has an advantage also has a disadvantage probably
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u put everything under one soc u probs have a harder time to get heat away
18:11 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so you cannot clock to 7ghz or whatever ddr5 and new intels clock nowadays xd
18:15 < bridge> <Ryozuki> üçê
18:25 < bridge> <deen> @Zwelf Are you available to help with https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6304 ?
18:27 < bridge> <Zwelf> I'll take a look. If I don't find anything, we can also take it out again for now.
18:32 < bridge> <Zwelf> which maps are the crashes on?`
18:32 < bridge> <murpi> The most recent one was on FarLands
18:32 < bridge> <murpi> https://ddnet.org/maps/FarLands
18:33 < bridge> <Zwelf> ok, could reproduce. will fix
18:33 < bridge> <murpi> Thanks!
18:42 < bridge> <Faulty> @deen I'm not familiar with your workflow yet, do I need to do anything else with my PR, or should I wait for approval from someone?
19:50 < bridge> <Mahdiyar> Hello  what is the function of this?
19:50 < bridge> <Mahdiyar> ```
19:50 < bridge> <Mahdiyar> MACRO_CONFIG_STR(ClMapDownloadUrl, cl_map_download_url, 100, "https://maps.ddnet.org", CFGFLAG_CLIENT | CFGFLAG_SAVE, "URL used to download maps (can start with http:// or https://)")
19:50 < bridge> <Mahdiyar> MACRO_CONFIG_INT(ClMapDownloadConnectTimeoutMs, cl_map_download_connect_timeout_ms, 2000, 0, 100000, CFGFLAG_CLIENT | CFGFLAG_SAVE, "HTTP map downloads: timeout for the connect phase in milliseconds (0 to disable)")

19:50 < bridge> <Mahdiyar> ```
19:50 < bridge> <Mahdiyar> Map is downloaded from the server
19:51 < bridge> <Mahdiyar> @heinrich5991
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> It checks the download url first to use faster map download via http instead of the game server sending it via the teeworlds protocol
19:52 <+ChillerDragon> if the download url serves the map it uses it if not it falls back to the vanilla download
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> Yo bois I did my first run through documenting all system messages of the 0.7 protocol any feedback to the layout or content? Suggestions? https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/system_messages.html
19:54 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 @Learath2 @Robyt3 ^ :p
19:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @Robyt3 was not ping I pinged him now
19:58 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> @Robyt3 was not pinged I pinged him now
19:58 <+ChillerDragon> ty
20:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Im dumb and get it now, i thought it was a typo for peer but its just cuz apple's apple
20:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ü§¶
20:12 < bridge> <Chairn> üôÇ
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ryozuki either its a client side bug, or the skin registering is extremly unreliable
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so many servers dont have the information
20:53 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it regulary fails to fetch it even on server that had it previously
20:59 < bridge> <Ryozuki> hmm
21:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> its weird
21:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> but only updated ddnet servers report it
21:00 < bridge> <Ryozuki> maybe somehow the function is not being called sometimes? xd
21:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i am 99% sure it also happened on a server that showed skins then suddenly not anymore
23:04 < bridge> <deen> yes, it's definitely unreliable. The servers have long  been updated but still don't show skin
