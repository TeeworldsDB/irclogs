02:58 <@deen> EastByte: I'll be out of country from June 06 - 13, possibly without Internet. Would you be interested in looking after the DDNet eservers in that time and releasing maps?
02:59 <@deen> Swedish Wilderness or something^^

20:36 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/vT3cX
20:36 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 9877233 def: Fix server crash with doors
20:37 < laxa> deen: my brother is asking, is ddnet event gestion async ?
20:39 <@deen> Say hi to Chairn from me
20:39 <@deen> gestion?
20:39 < laxa> if you increase your fps, will your mouse/keyboard event be faster ?
20:39 < laxa> sent to server faster I mean
20:40 <@deen> not with gfx_threaded_old 1 and gfx_asyncrender_old 1, which are enabled by default in ddnet (and disabled in other mods i think)
20:40 < laxa> He said to me that I had to do a pull request
20:40 <@deen> haha
20:40 < laxa> about fps_max 
20:40 <@deen> sure
20:40 <@deen> there is already something prepared in the code for it
20:40 <@deen> just no one implemented it, it seems
20:40 < laxa> is there any utilities ?
20:41 < laxa> what tickrate are server using ?
20:41 <@deen> f1, gfx_refresh_rate
20:41 <@deen> that should do something but it does nothing
20:41 <@deen> utilties?
20:41 < laxa> hum ok
20:41 < laxa> Well, is there anything to gain to have more fps than your actual screen refresh rate
20:41 < laxa> faster keyboard input for example
20:42 < Learath2> dont think so
20:42 <@deen> yes, i think it gives you faster keyboard input
20:42 <@deen> but I only skimmed the code
20:42 < laxa> SDL 2.0 is async I think, not SDL 1 ?
20:42 <@deen> the polling is in the same thread as graphics
20:42 < laxa> ah
20:42 < laxa> right
20:42 <@deen> no idea
20:44 < laxa> there is only a defined macro in source code for gfx_refresh_rate
20:44 <@deen> exactly
20:45 <@deen> everything needs to be implemented, but hey, the setting is there already :P
20:45 < laxa> :D
20:45 < laxa> So, I am trying to understand how this is working
20:45 < laxa> servers runs at 60 ticks ?
20:45 <@deen> i think Savander posted it already
20:45 <@deen> server runs at 50 ticks
20:45 <@deen> BUT some events are handled immediately when the server receives them
20:45 <@deen> for example hook and fire events
20:45 < laxa> Ah
20:46 <@deen> which is why you can jump and shoot when frozen
20:46 < laxa> well, if you have more fps, you have a chance to win in best case scenario 1 tick right ?
20:46 <@deen> you shoot immediately, but only get refrozen after 20 ms
20:46 <@deen> for the server communication it doesn't matter, i made sure of that
20:46 <@deen> i always play with vsync and have perfectly low ping
20:47 <@deen> for keyboard and mouse input it may matter
20:47 < savander> my code about fps_max
20:47 < savander> works similar to cpu_throttle
20:47 <@deen> savander: right, should've used gfx_refresh_rate for that :P
20:47 < savander> t same results, lower fps and sometimes mouse increase speed.
20:48 < savander> gfx_refresh_rate?
20:48 < savander> i doesn't work? it is?
20:49 <@deen> savander: it's another name for what you implemented, but no one implemented it
20:49 <@deen> was just prepared
20:49 < savander> ou.
20:49 < savander> didn't know
20:49 < laxa> deen: there is no way to increase tickrate on server ?
20:50 < savander> but my code is very experimental.
20:50 <@deen> laxa: there is a tickrate define in the code, I tried to change it and couldn't even connect to the server
20:50 < savander> i don't compute it very well.
20:50 < laxa> Ok, I am just curious, you are way better than me at those things anyway :)
20:51 < savander> how long thread_sleep should be.
20:51 < laxa> I am just learning how to code for a game, making a r-type like in SDL 2.0 for school
20:51 <@deen> cool
20:52 < savander> so because my calculate isn't very accurate, screen sometimes shaking.
20:55 < savander> but if gfx_refresh_rate exists, i should rewrite code to use this command
20:56 <@deen> right
20:56 <@deen> or remove gfx_refresh_rate
20:56 < savander> cl_fps_max more user-friendly i gues
20:56 < savander> guess,, haha
20:57 <@deen> gfx_max_fps then
20:57 < savander> sure
20:59 < savander> 10 minutes
20:59 < savander> and i'll make pull if you want
21:01 < laxa> deen: have you ever considered logging possibility in teeworlds ?
21:02 <@deen> logging possibility?
21:02 < laxa> well
21:02 <@deen> savander: I don't need this feature, I prefer vsync, ask laxa and his family
21:02 <@deen> :P
21:02 < laxa> I don't care personnally, I am not playing anymore
21:02 < laxa> but if keyboard input can win 1 tick cause you have higher fps, then it's usefull
21:02 < laxa> otherwise, it's useless
21:03 < laxa> deen: client.cpp line 2558, is that kind of information logged somewhere if Sound init failed ?
21:03 < savander> so nevermind
21:04 < laxa> savander: try to verify if keyboard input is faster with higher fps ?
21:04 < savander> shouldn't be
21:04 < laxa> it could be
21:04 < savander> i sleep only graphics generate
21:04 <@deen> laxa: why do you want to log that?
21:04 <@deen> i don't get it
21:04 < laxa> deen: dunno, could be usefull to have logging information when player are having difficulties with teeworlds
21:05 <@deen> laxa: sure, set logfile foo.log in autoexec.cfg
23:42 < laxa> savander: is your fps limiter working ?
23:42 < savander> yes
23:43 < laxa> why not pulling req then ?
23:44 < savander> deen don't want this so.
23:44 <@deen> i don't?
23:45 <@deen> i don't need it for myself, but i would accept a PR
23:45 < savander> [20:59] <savander> and i'll make pull if you want [21:01] <laxa> deen: have you ever considered logging possibility in teeworlds ? [21:01] <@deen> logging possibility? [21:01] <laxa> well [21:01] <@deen> savander: I don't need this feature, I prefer vsync, ask laxa and his family
23:46 <@deen> savander: yeah, Chairn wanted it
23:47 < savander> if only one want it, useless feature.
