00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> is there any way to increase the distance of showing others? (`/showothers`)
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `/showall` or sth?
01:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> do you mean the distance render of tees?
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> exactly @NeXus
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> since I got 1920x1080 screen, i can't imagine playing on default zoom of 10
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> cuz my tee is damn ass big
01:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> so I changed zoom level to 7, and then tees appear when in 1/3 of my screen, since on further distances they are not rendered
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> then do /showall
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> did
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> btw F1 doesn't show such command exists
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and still, after saying `/showall`
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu>

01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> the red line shows where +- tees start to appear
01:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> same from left side
01:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> say /showall in chat
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that's why I did after console didn't show any message that such cmd exists
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> that's what I did after console didn't show any message that such cmd exists
01:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> are you on ddnet server
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> y
01:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> with latest ddnet client
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> on windows 7 x64
01:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> using borderless window and without OpenGL enabled
01:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> ok, nvm, seems like it somehow got fixed but with nice delay
01:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> o
03:33 <+Learath2> I'm playing on a 1440p screen with the default zoom :D

16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> oh, 1440p = 4K if i remember
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW | Blizzard Team> UHD
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it's 2k
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nvm
18:53 <+Learath2> once you go 1440p 1080p monitors look blurry :P
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> can we do something about this map "protection"... its pissing me off, i can never watch my demos  from zbskycraft because the map is protected
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> please just get the zbskycraft file from the server and fix it using the tool
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> and uploading it ofc, since everyone has the map (sp someone posted fixed version in forum) its useless and just blocks players watching the demo
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't think we should do that without permission from the author. but we could stop hosting it instead
