01:57 < bridge> <Ewan> anyone know how to be able to use the `&XXXXXX` color format in your commands
02:01 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> do you mean smh like this https://github.com/Inateblig/dfng/blob/bf41fdff5f7748269fa3f547c5af8adb8911e884/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L922 ?

02:24 < bridge> <Ewan> I‚Äôm genuinely not sure
02:25 < bridge> <Ewan> im hearing reports that syntax isn‚Äôt working & I‚Äôm just using a color cast to RGBA from the HSLA color that exists in g_Config
02:26 < bridge> <Ewan> i used the ui_color handling as a reference for that implementation, iirc
02:26 < bridge> <Ewan> im hearing reports that & syntax isn‚Äôt working & I‚Äôm just using a color cast to RGBA from the HSLA color that exists in g_Config. I hadn‚Äôt even heard of using & for it until now so maybe it‚Äôs only supposed to work on certain colors?

02:30 < bridge> <Ewan> they cited the player color as something that does work with this syntax, though. this is probably what I‚Äôm looking for. i just don‚Äôt get how & is related to bitpacking the number
08:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> Using full when using color eyre will show u code snippets
13:29 < bridge> <Learath2> I don't think we have &. It should be $
15:39 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> hi, is this fixed btw? if so it was probs unrelated to the skins, but they still fail quite often
16:01 < bridge> <Ewan> does this only work with the hex triplet? i can't get it to have non-FF opacity
16:24 < bridge> <Learath2> Been a while since I coded it. I think $FF000080 should work
16:43 < bridge> <Ewan> nada
16:44 < bridge> <Ewan> anything longer than 6 digits is just black
16:48 < bridge> <Learath2> I can take a look later
17:06 < bridge> <Ewan> that would be nice thanks
17:06 < bridge> <Ewan> oh actually
17:06 < bridge> <Ewan> let me test something first
17:07 < bridge> <Ewan> yeah i was just testing whether or not it worked on recent vanilla ddnet and still doesn't work
17:10 < bridge> <Learath2> Took a quick look, apparently I didn't implement it. So if you want alpha you'll have to use decimal
17:10 < bridge> <Learath2> Packed teeworlds colors that is
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> thanks
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> garbage
17:11 < bridge> <Learath2> üò≠
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> that color format is garbage
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> not u
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> üòÉ
17:11 < bridge> <Learath2> Too late, I'm already crying
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> may as well add that though
17:11 < bridge> <Ewan> for the time being ill use decimal format
17:12 < bridge> <Learath2> Should be easy enough to add though if you want, just one more branch in `src/engine/shared/console.cpp:L60` for len 5 and 9
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> would be simpler to tack onto an existing pr tbh
17:17 < bridge> <Ewan> to ddnet

18:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> lmaoo
18:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> the lose a children
18:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> > If you drag an emoji family with a string size of 11 into an input with maxlength=10, one of the children will disappear.

18:24 < bridge> <0108ben> XDDDD
18:24 < bridge> <Ryozuki> XDDDDDDDDDDD
18:25 < bridge> <Ryozuki> throw the kid out into the void
18:25 < bridge> <Devinci> This is gold xD
18:25 < bridge> <Devinci> I'm stealing it
18:31 < bridge> <bencie> LOL wth
19:54 < bridge> <Ewan> thanks robyt

20:19 < bridge> <Ewan> hmmmm
20:19 < bridge> <Robyt3> Yeah, turns out there are rust tests for this function

21:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> thanks robyt
21:05 < bridge> <fokkonaut> you're so amazing ü§≠
21:24 < bridge> <Ewan> he prob wants u to respond to his review
22:32 < bridge> <J0love> when can tee take off christmas hat?
22:32 < bridge> <Ryozuki> never
22:34 < bridge> <J0love> huhÔºü
22:57 < bridge> <heinrich5991> `full` is not about the hidden frames, but something else?
22:57 < bridge> <Ryozuki> idk, i just know it told me that
22:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> with color eyre
22:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> and it showed me snippets
22:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i thought it was cool
22:58 < bridge> <Ryozuki> snippets of the call sites
23:09 < bridge> <0108ben> Hi! On 90% of servers i get stuck at this part and then afrter a few minuites it says i have too weak connection to join, any ideas how to fix (i have good internet connection xd)
