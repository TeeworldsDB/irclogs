05:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> appearently this was merged into mesa now:
05:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/7477
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª interesting. intel has also unified most of their windows and linux driver: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=intel-server-igc&num=1
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> I dont get the text render code it is doing soo much o.O but seems like there is a inf loop if a ping filter is entered that is longer than g_Config.m_BrFilterPing.
11:02 <+ChillerDragon> hangs here https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/a9631bf9cd71bb4e7b6a67e71976a7c9eace8bd5/src/engine/client/text.cpp#L941
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> pCurr=0x7fffffffae95 pEnd=0x7fffffffae96 these values stuck for me
11:03 <+ChillerDragon> seems like pCurrent was not changing anymore
11:08 <+ChillerDragon> WordLength(pCurrent) seems to be 0 is that ok?
11:12 <+ChillerDragon> well idk i rq debugging now here is my stack https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/Zv
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @ChillerDragon nice find
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i'll look into it
11:19 <+ChillerDragon> :)
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @deen did the prediction code change lately?
14:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> coke says that the tee movement feels different, and that only between 15.1.x and RC
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> (from gfx point i only see `gfx_quad_as_triangle` and the blacklist for intel, which will default to GL 2.0, which looks different bcs of lacking mipmap support)
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=LLVM-Master-Plan-Phase-Out-2020
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At this rate of adoption Africa might even forget that Europeans pillaged it for like an entire century or two by the end of 2020
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_Wise:
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> <3
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> when does ddnet do it?
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> LLVM already had lost a couple top contributors for their CoC. Forming a foundation that detached itself from the actual developers to handle community issues has served them soo well
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª I am personally planning to visit a marginalized community and beg for their forgiveness before changing the branch name. After all we opressed them for so long
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm sure with all the debilitating diseases and hunger plaguing Africa, they have been actively following open source software
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why u speak like its the past
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we still abuse them
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Shhhh
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its true tho
15:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You are not supposed to talk about that. We decolonised africa and we are totally not using most of the worlds population as wage slaves
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > when does ddnet do it?
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª never :PES2_Wise:
15:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 CoC always leads to drama and political andys trying to add shit
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw, we probably should do it if someone ever approaches us. It's better for the projects outlook if a nutjob with a checkmark on twitter doesn't mark us as racists
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://itsfoss.com/linux-code-of-conduct/
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, i just see a Arte(german/french television program) video once per year how everything shifts from asia to africa to abuse it even cheaper xD
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the only good CoC is "be nice"
15:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar âœª africa is chinas china now
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @Ryozuki i would already rename it just to troll u
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :weird:
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> tho "main" sounds better imo
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> default
15:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ew
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have it bound to muscle memory:
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git fetch upstream
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git reset --hard upstream/master
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would name it stable and adopt a better merge process for that branch. E.g. only tagged releases
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we dont need to change
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im sure african developers use master as their master branch
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and they dont even care
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> default, main, intial all make sense but they are not as good as master. Not because master is more descriptive or a better name, it's because everyone just knows master
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> When I clone a repo, I know the branch will be master
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/collections/made-in-africa
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they all use master
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really want to meet one of these developers that have anxiety about the name master btw. They always mention this mysterious portion of developers
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> In reality they always turn out to be people that are definitely not part of a marginalized group, but just people having trouble making peace with their history
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 dont u see twitter, its always white rich girls complaining about stuff
15:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> it seems some people just don't have enough problems to solve, so they create new ones
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yes komrade
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> TW source code is awaiting their refactoring skills ðŸ˜„
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well not enough problems in the wealthy western nations and in the households of their very affluent developers
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look, someone in tw source code knows the max extend of human abilities
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/777182401377730590/unknown.png
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki I bet matricks or someone else just clicked as fast as they could and checked the values :P
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :poggers:
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 we have so many commented out code in ddnet
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> r u sure we still need it
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
15:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u dont need it
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah im for removing it
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> same with debug code xD
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> its soo useless
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We don't, we can clean up most of it now that clang-format killed our chances of merging with vanilla
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like the dbg_msg
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not that
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean that client option
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh idk what it is
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What debug code?
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> f21
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> f1
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> debug 1
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Â¿
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> it connects u to ur local server
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and does random stuff
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> which seems completly useless xd
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, the dbg stress or sth thing?
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ye
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/777187738838630460/unknown.png
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki oh, are you doing the harfbuzz thing?
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 i tried but i dont understand half the stuff
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so i just added it to cmake
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought the documentation was quite decent for harfbuzz
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean, im too lazy to understand how our text rendering works
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not a harfbuzz thing
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can't say the same about our own text rendering yeah :D
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though most of the complexity is caused by text layout, which harfbuzz does for you
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> doesnt just mirroring chat work?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though harfbuzz doesn't know a thing about multiline text so you need to chop up the text yourself and there is another layer of complexity in the mess that is the ui coordinate system vs freetype subpixel coordinates vs font size vs freetype pixel font size vs the actual screen resolution
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u also need the bidirectional unicode thingy
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Bidi we can worry about later
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would just leave comments on where I would insert it at this stage
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the world would be soo easy if we'd only have latin characters
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> no utf8
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just char range
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yes, ban æ—¥æœ¬èªž
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lets go back to the age of codepages
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you can map your alphabet to the ascii range you can have your alphabet supported, if not tough tits
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> imo that wouldnt be a step backward
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but forward
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> unicode is bloated af
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Lol, think of the poor asian countries
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah we need a transition to english
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> most european lanuages also work with only a-z
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Ã¼ gets ue
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and stuff like that
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ã±Ã±Ã±
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Great idea, it would at most destroy all human productivity for a generation or two while everyone adjusts
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Ã§Ã§Ã§
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wouldnt mind having english universal
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes, useless productivity tho
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> overcomplicated
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want to see countries that are doing it the correct way, look no further than northern eu
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They have their own languages, yet they are all thought english at an astonishing level
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'd say dutch and german ppl can talk english good too
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> french ppl not xDD
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The guy who checked my ticket at a train station in helsinki was like 70yo and his english was better than mine
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> crazy ðŸ˜„
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I fully expected the guy to just point me to someone who spoke english or communicate in broken english combined with proto sign language :P
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> French people know english, they just never speak it. Mind boggling
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well even france changes on this
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but when u speak to older ppl, no chance
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I ask for directions in plain english, the guy gives them in french...
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I know enough french to understand directions, but still, my man why do you assume? If I was confident in my french, I would have asked in french
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i learned latin instead of french
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And if you don't know english, how did you understand my question?
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> best decision ever
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Italian, french, spanish, latin all the same
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :P
16:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> if you learned latin, you can read all languages a bit
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> catalan
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Germans have great english too, though they usually have a heavy accent
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The dutch practically don't speak dutch :D
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dutch is drunken german + drunken english
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's astonishing how good their education system teaches them english
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and that actually fits
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats the funny part about it
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think culture would be lost if we all spoke a single common language only
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> culture doesnt have to be tied to a language tho
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but ye its part of it
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> cultures change, else latin wouldnt be dead
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs i'd defs speak it xd
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> > It's astonishing how good their education system teaches them english
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> @Learath2 
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> 
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Hmm not sure if it is true but i guess. At university all studies are almost in english for example.
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> 
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> But people older then 40 are not really educated or educated themselves.
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen forum got a bit buggy displays this stuff i think, i remember it not showing the full link on player and mapper
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/777210718491115571/unknown.png
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :thonk: i though harfbuzz only do shaping?
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :thonk: i thought harfbuzz only do shaping?
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ryozuki don't  care enough to fix. will always keep conflicting with new code changes in updates
18:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
