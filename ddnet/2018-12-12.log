01:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> I think the 5min vote delay shouldn't be on map votes, that one can be pretty annoying

06:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :tear: is embarassed emote
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Quote> no. with red face
06:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Quote> in eye section
08:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> :thonkery:
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Quote we're probably not going to change the emotes. You can edit the graphics to make it look any way you want though, but that will only be for yourself
16:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> Maybe, if we finally go away from vanilla teeworlds, we can add dynamic resources uploading? Like custom server emotions, custom weapons skins etc. It can be loaded like map on server connection but in separate file(or folder). Or it is impossible/hard to provide/not relevant?
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> possible, but i wouldn't like it personally
16:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> Because it affect gameplay staff and certainly each add privileges system with buying pretty picture for real money?
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> because it's just some optical change, not required
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> All our life mostly just optical changings 😀
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Faulty> All our life basically just optical changings 😀
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Huh, that's an interesting perspective on life, but can't say I agree. There are things that aren't just optical changes 🙂
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> Wouldn't like it either, and better focus on different things. I mean optical stuff should be low priority at the moment id you ask me.
20:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skills> Yo why my game crashes i just got new pc and it was working fine  then i tried to change my name in ddnet folders then tried open game and it crashes everytime at loading screen
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Skills what is "change my name in ddnet folders"?
21:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> crashes how? any output, set a logfile?
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FlushA_Go> @deen I think his/her mean change name from settings_ddnet.cfg in teeworlds folder
21:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ah, maybe use another editor that doesn't change the file to windows line endings?
