00:19 <+bridge> <cauldron1> I am still on this demo render feature... I actually think `set_view` is a really nice feature. I defined ~40 views with coordinates and zoom and put them in 00.cfg - 40.cfg, then I rendered my demo and changed view via f1: `exec 00.cfg`. And then `exec 01.cfg` and so on. That's my first result...
00:20 <+bridge> <cauldron1> https://btp.uber.space/01_new.mp4
00:21 <+bridge> <cauldron1> i think it's a funny way to render a demo
01:43 <+bridge> <totar> I just realized this will close the oldest open issue :o
02:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> sweet
02:51 <+bridge> <Ewan> i wish there was some sort of client integrity system besides ID
02:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> because i can't prove i'm not botting when the sensitive antibot on whichever server bans me
02:52 <+bridge> <Ewan> lol
02:54 <+bridge> <totar> I thought the antibot was not very sensitive
02:54 <+bridge> <totar> I've never seen it ban anyone
02:54 <+bridge> <Ewan> not on ddrace
02:54 <+bridge> <totar> fng?
02:54 <+bridge> <Ewan> fokkonaut block
02:56 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> fundamentally impossible
02:57 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> you can never prove that you're running the original client. and if you could, that you're not emulating your input otherwise
02:57 <+bridge> <Ewan> that's absolutely not true
02:58 <+bridge> <Ewan> just as an example discord watermarks API requests sent from the client
02:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> and i understand it's not 1:1 and obfuscation like this is not encouraged for open source projects
02:59 <+bridge> <totar> do you mean client integrity or user itentification?
02:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> but this is a video game that seems to take botting seriously
02:59 <+bridge> <totar> do you mean client integrity or user identification?
02:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> client integrity
02:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> the latter would be nice too
02:59 <+bridge> <Ewan> but that's not my point
02:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> what does 1:1 mean in this context?
03:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> one's a proprietary chat app, the other's an open source video game
03:00 <+bridge> <totar> how does watermarking the API prevent client modifications?
03:00 <+bridge> <Ewan> if only the official client or other 'server-approved' clients are able to reproduce this behavior you can weed out custom clients that may or may not have illegitimate functionalities
03:01 <+bridge> <totar> I don't think there's any fundamental reason a modified client can't exactly replicate the behavior of the official one
03:01 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> fundamentally impossible
03:01 <+bridge> <Ewan> if it's open source it would be difficult
03:02 <+bridge> <totar> how?
03:02 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> check cheats existing for games with large publishers behind them
03:02 <+bridge> <Ewan> they probably do have client-side integrity behavior and it's just been reverse engineered by the cheat community which would be much larger than ddnet's by comparison
03:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's also not impossible or uncommon to have a proprietary module in an open-source environment for exactly this reason
03:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> yes. but as you just said it's not possible to make this guarantee something
03:03 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> it might make it harder to break though
03:03 <+bridge> <Ewan> yes
03:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> but we started from here
03:04 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> and you can't prove you're not botting. you can only prove that people who weren't clever enough are botting
03:04 <+bridge> <Ewan> yeah
03:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> idk what the server antibot was thinking anyway lol
03:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> all i'd been doing was farming and i tab back into game and i'm being manhandled by some dude trying to get my money
03:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> i block him and i get banned
03:05 <+bridge> <Ewan> üòÉ
03:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> maybe high ping and packet frequency fluctuation could have something to do with it
03:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> but idk how it works all that much
08:38 <+bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea @noby false positives on fokko Server are a bit frequent. Anything you could do? \:)
08:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> my ban is a week xd
08:38 <+bridge> <Ewan> it's really cool
08:50 <+bridge> <reitw> what fokko can do is like us
08:50 <+bridge> <reitw> don't auto ban, verify if you find someone sus
08:50 <+bridge> <reitw> noby's ab auto-ban works the best only on fng server

13:30 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i find it funny
13:30 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I don't have humor
13:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye i forgot ur german
13:31 <+bridge> <ryozuki> (heinrich dont ban me, this is german humor)
13:32 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks idk why grug reminds me a bit of chiller

13:46 <+bridge> <robyt3> What is that command line? Use cmake to generate "Unix Makefiles" or project files for Visual Studio, depending on what you want to use. The linker error suggest you didn't install Rust (correctly).
13:57 <+bridge> <devinci24> I got a question for pretty much everyone with a laptop.
13:57 <+bridge> <devinci24> Would you rather recommend getting a mac (probably a newish one) or something else (like a lenovo or something good enough) and then putting some linux distro onto it.
13:57 <+bridge> <devinci24> I got a question for pretty much everyone with a laptop.
13:57 <+bridge> <devinci24> Would you rather recommend getting a mac (probably a newish one) or something else (like a lenovo or something good enough) and then putting some linux distro on it.
13:59 <+bridge> <heinrich5991> not sure how well linux works on the new macs these days
14:00 <+bridge> <gerdoe> thinkpad carbon goes brrr
14:01 <+bridge> <devinci24> Yeah no. I heard there's some kind of dual but mac/ linux going on. But if I get a mac it's probably to stay on it
14:02 <+bridge> <devinci24> Thanks I'll keep it in mind ^^
14:03 <+bridge> <devinci24> Seems a bit expensive tho
14:05 <+bridge> <deen> I like the M1 MBP, definitely don't get an Intel one
14:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> ye m1 is fast af
14:05 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i prefer linux tho
14:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> yea also the 14‚Äù mbp is a joke iirc it‚Äôs pretty neutered compared to the bigger ones and just go with an air at that point
14:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> no cooling iirc
14:06 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It depends on what u want to do. I have a laptop too and recommend you a desktop PC with rtx 4090
14:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> what does this mean
14:06 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i think i got the mac book pro (small?) from work, and it cools rly well
14:06 <+bridge> <Ewan> they don‚Äôt put fans on the small ones
14:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> never found it hot
14:07 <+bridge> <devinci24> I want a laptop, can't take my desktop everwhere I go sadly
14:07 <+bridge> <Ewan> which generation
14:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Just need to be creative
14:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> how to know without opening it?
14:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> xd
14:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> MacOS means basically no gaming
14:07 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I dunno if u care about that
14:07 <+bridge> <devinci24> Why no intel if I may ask?
14:07 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it has usb-c on sides and the charger is the apple magnetic thing
14:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> it doesnt have the thing on the keyboard that they removed on newer gens iirc
14:08 <+bridge> <ryozuki> probs newer gen
14:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> i thought magsafe was only on the m2 air
14:09 <+bridge> <devinci24> Already got pc for that ^^. Now I just want some decent laptop to work. No mouse or anything, just a laptop. I've used one for a week and the touchpad seemed decent
14:09 <+bridge> <Ewan> unless the m2 pro is out and i missed it üòµ‚Äçüí´
14:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> not magsafe
14:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its another thing
14:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1123223657792155699/macbook-pro-16-accessories.png
14:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> oh maybe it is
14:09 <+bridge> <ryozuki> its this
14:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Which kind of work^^
14:10 <+bridge> <Ewan> that is magsafe
14:10 <+bridge> <devinci24> Probably just code x)
14:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> mac touchpad is definitly on the high end i think
14:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then m1 is probably nice indeed
14:10 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Or m2
14:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> the thing is m1 is arm
14:10 <+bridge> <ryozuki> not x86
14:11 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if u wanna code depends
14:12 <+bridge> <devinci24> I probably wont touch anything lower than C, so it shouldn't matter right?
14:12 <+bridge> <Ewan> ‚ùì
14:12 <+bridge> <devinci24> Ehh..
14:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ‚ùó
14:12 <+bridge> <devinci24> Ok nvm
14:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If u stay inside c standard spec
14:12 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Then yes
14:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> @devinci24 thats broad
14:13 <+bridge> <ryozuki> im just saying u will have to be careful
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> some deps may be only on x86
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but rosetta may help
14:14 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i havent had any issues tho
14:14 <+bridge> <devinci24> Ah, ok makes sense
14:15 <+bridge> <devinci24> You've been doing rust on a mac?
14:16 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> And u should expect certain libraries to not work great on macos
14:17 <+bridge> <devinci24> Welp, that's good to know
14:17 <+bridge> <devinci24> And putting some vm seems kinda stupid right?
14:18 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Generally since apple is closed ecosystem, it doesn't get the most support of open source devs
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> i only use mac cuz my company provided it, so i use it when i go to office
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> otherwise i use my gentoo linux
14:18 <+bridge> <ryozuki> but u can use rust on mac ofc
14:20 <+bridge> <devinci24> Well, thanks a lot all. I'll still need to think exactly what I want to do... wouldn't want to be stuck cause some lib doesn't work well
14:23 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It's mostly libs that use or implement an API . So your math library will probably work without problems
14:23 <+bridge> <ryozuki> if its for work, think what u do at work and what they require u, software u use etc
14:31 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> is there a good mobile coding app? like, if you want to write code but you're at work?

17:00 <+bridge> <cyberFighter> its cool stuff
17:01 <+bridge> <patiga> agreed :)
17:02 <+bridge> <patiga> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6196 has some discussion about the implementation details
17:04 <+bridge> <patiga> parallax zoom is beautiful was really needed imo, zooming without it really didn't look good

18:12 < ChillerDragon> @_voxeldoesart i use my work pc to write private code
18:12 < ChillerDragon> ah i guess it depends on what you work
18:12 < ChillerDragon> i work at a pc :D
18:13 < ChillerDragon> if you dont have a work pc bring private laptop to work
18:13 < ChillerDragon> using phone is the worst
18:19 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> is that the gboard
18:20 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> if so then i dont want google to listen in on me writing shitty code with my voice
18:20 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> ngl its ironic because i never get personalized popups
18:21 <+bridge> <_voxeldoesart> at least ones that surprise me

20:25 <+bridge> <robyt3> https://xkcd.com/2793/
20:29 <+bridge> <teero777> i am very confused. if i call LinesBegin() and LinesEnd() after i get an assertion saying i began lines twice. if i remove the linesbegin i get the assertion linesend called without linesbegin. ???
20:30 <+bridge> <totar> did you put one of them in a loop
20:30 <+bridge> <teero777> nope
20:30 <+bridge> <totar> did you forget to do quads end?
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777> Graphics()->LinesBegin();
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>             for(...)
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>             {
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>                           ....
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>             }
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>             Graphics()->LinesEnd();
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>                         Graphics()->QuadsEnd();
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777> basically this
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777> `           Graphics()->LinesBegin();
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>             for(...)
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>             {
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>                           ....
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>             }
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>             Graphics()->LinesEnd();
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>              Graphics()->QuadsEnd();`
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777> basically this
20:31 <+bridge> <totar> I don't think you can have Lines and Quads active at the same time. it's setting the render function of the gpu so it can only be one
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777> `           Graphics()->LinesBegin();
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>             for(...)
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>             {
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>                           ....
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>                           Graphics()->LinesDraw(...;
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>             }
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>             Graphics()->LinesEnd();
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777>              Graphics()->QuadsEnd();`
20:31 <+bridge> <teero777> basically this
20:32 <+bridge> <teero777> hmm okay ill try
20:33 <+bridge> <teero777> ah nice it works
20:34 <+bridge> <teero777> ty for fast reply i wouldve probably been stuck there for some minutes

20:48 <+bridge> <ceeper1> I already have it redirected to port 8303 but I can't play on my server with a friend, sv_register is set to 1, and changed to ipv4
20:48 <+bridge> <ceeper1> Help me pls
20:55 <+bridge> <stnwtr> Can I use a custom master server to hide my server in public list?
20:55 <+bridge> <stnwtr> So only users who added the ip of mine could see them.
20:55 <+bridge> <stnwtr> (everyone could connect by directly entering the ip)
20:56 <+bridge> <totar> just dont register the server, players can still connect with the ip
20:56 <+bridge> <stnwtr> yeah, but my way would work as well?
20:57 <+bridge> <totar> what's the point of a custom master server?
20:57 <+bridge> <stnwtr> nothing. just want to know
20:58 <+bridge> <totar> idk if the client can set a custom master server url
20:59 <+bridge> <ceeper1> that is, my server may not appear, but can I log in via an IP?
20:59 <+bridge> <stnwtr> you can always login with ip
21:00 <+bridge> <ceeper1> will my friend be able to come in? if he doesn't show my server?
21:00 <+bridge> <stnwtr> if Firewall is configured properly
21:03 <+bridge> <ceeper1> firewall is this:

21:03 <+bridge> <ceeper1> ?
21:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> was there never space between them? xd
21:21 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1123332343847985222/image.png
21:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do u really want to open a server to the public if you dont even know what a firewall is?
21:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
21:22 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> better it would be better to research a bit üôÇ
21:25 <+bridge> <ceeper1> I'm sorry, it's over, but why say that right away? I definitely want to do it, what's stopping me? and besides, I asked a question to help me, I use a translator.tk I'm not English.I want to show the map to my friends, besides, my server was working, and what is it that I don't know, it was easier to say than to humiliate me somehow
21:25 <+bridge> <robyt3> It was "Refreshing..." before. It looks better without the space with the icon font
21:25 <+bridge> <robyt3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1123333402880380998/image.png
21:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh k
21:26 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u really want it, just google "firewall" lmao
21:27 <+bridge> <robyt3> but it would look better if it was an animated spinning icon while it's refreshing
21:27 <+bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ez
