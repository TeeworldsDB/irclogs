12:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok i tested it on win7 32 bit.
12:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the server looks fine.
12:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> the client crashes alot, in debug mode 9/10 in release mode 3/10 XD
12:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
12:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i also tried to debug it, the aio thread is always in the fwrite function call
12:45 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno if its related, but the mainthread calls FreeConsole directly before it
12:45 <+Learath2> @Jupstar that's exactly the crash I get, very hard to debug :/
13:03 < bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> stitch626 is dead
13:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @DanilBest ?
13:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Thanks @Jupstar âœª. So, not fixed @heinrich5991
13:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜¦
13:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Revert "Revert "â€¦""
13:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> Is the infclass discord server closed?
13:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> Is the infclass discord server closed ðŸ˜¦
13:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> bad news: Is the infclass discord server closed ðŸ˜¦
13:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> Is the infclass discord server closed ðŸ˜¦
14:05 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
14:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <-TwistÂ°~> Is there a way to add total teamrank/rank ingame ? Atm you can only see the rank/teamrank for the map you are on. Would be cool if you could do /teamrank brutal/oldschool/moderate etc.
14:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <Wombat> you mean /teamrank "Deadcore 2" for example?
14:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Wombat> to see your time on another map just write /mapinfo Deadcore 2
14:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <-TwistÂ°~> No I mean the total teamrank and on the different servers. You can only see them in Forum
14:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <-TwistÂ°~> Like /points is possible but not the total teamrank or rank
14:32 < bridge> [ddnet] <-TwistÂ°~>

14:33 < bridge> [ddnet] <-TwistÂ°~> This also exists for Brutal/moderate/ddmax/oldschool etc
15:10 <@deen> @Twist possible yet, but I don't think we will do it. It can't easily be calculated on-the-fly, so the info would always be out-of-date anyway
15:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <-TwistÂ°~> Alright I was just wondering. I guess it doesn't take to long to look it up in the Forum anyways. Maybe someday in the future ðŸ˜„
15:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> forum?
15:21 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
15:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <-TwistÂ°~> *Homepage
15:22 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> hm?
15:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> so u want to check it manually
15:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sounds like a lot of work
15:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah it is possible on the site but not ingame
15:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> sry being stupid
15:24 < bridge> [ddnet] <-TwistÂ°~> Yep
22:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Can we safely provide a mysql interface to the database on ddnet.tw?
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so that people can run their own queries to check stuff, like on #general right now?
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> read-only of course, record_saves excluded and a low timeout?
22:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> But I guess having the db available to download is easy enough
22:18 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or provide a sqlite script to import the csv that we provide on ddnet.tw/stats
22:20 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar âœª https://forum.ddnet.tw/viewtopic.php?t=6409
23:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> in the time of data protection regulations a bold move :p
23:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ?
23:16 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> our ranks have always been public
23:27 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vxpXw
23:27 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 7973d55 def: TextQL instructions
23:31 < bridge> [ddnet] <cinaera> just wondering if the upcoming gdpr applies here also..
