15:18 <@heinrich5991> deen: that doesn't catch ./../
18:44 < timakro> hi, does anyone remeber when there was this bug that you could make windows computers play sounds by sending certain unicode characters in tw chat?
18:44 < timakro> im searching the commit that fixed it
18:54 < Learath2> timakro: maybe it's b4f7321dd62b66c2522bb1c35f310440dcb5d243
19:03 < timakro> yep, seems right, thanks Learath2 
19:03 < Learath2> \o
22:55 <@deen> heinrich5991: haha
22:56 <@deen> heinrich5991: meh, so how to do it properly?
22:56 <@deen> Maybe we just forbid any "../" inbetween, even though that catches too much...
23:07 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vHhVl
23:07 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master 59b33b9 def: Stronger catch for ..
23:14 < Learath2> deen: ../ at the start and /../ anywhere inbetween should be correct no?
23:17 <@deen> ?
23:18 < Learath2> you could match for ..(/|\\) at the beginning and (/|\\)..(/|\\) anywhere, which shouldn't match too much
23:18 <@deen> I know
23:18 <@deen> I wanted to do that and then I got tired by writing down each of those cases
23:19 <@deen> because yay, no regex
23:19 < Learath2> that might be one thing i miss in C but idk how I would implement it well either
23:19 <@deen> just write down each possible combination
23:19 <@deen> or make a parser
23:20 < Learath2> how I would implement regex I mean
23:22 <@deen> or just resolve it to the full path, and check that it's still inside basepath, but has to be careful with symlinks
23:22 < Learath2> resolving to fullpath does resolve symlinks tho no?
23:22 <@deen> probably
23:32 < timakro> hi i'm trying to display the race time in a different format to the player than the ghost (and demo) code needs it to parse. do you know any trick to send a chat message which is recognized by the ghost code but not displayed to the player?
23:32 < timakro> any property a chat message can have so the chat.cpp code doesn't display it?
23:34 < Learath2> timakro: maybe an m_Team that isn't in range
23:34 < Learath2> nope :/
23:35 < timakro> i tried appending the message after 256 bytes, after which the message isnt rendered anymore but the ghost code looks at the beginning of the message when parsing the player name :
23:36 < Learath2> does it have to be a chat message?
23:37 < timakro> yep
23:46 < Learath2> looks horrible :P http://codepad.org/gZQXlBH5
