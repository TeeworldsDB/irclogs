14:03 < timakro> i have a demo to prove that my rank on JungleRabies was legit, any chance of getting it back? http://misc.timakro.de/JungleRabies_2017-06-03_17-45-23.demo
20:22 < ddnet_user> hey guys
20:23 < ddnet_user> im looking for add user admin command , but i didnt found anything , how i can add username with another password ?
20:36 < ddnet_user> i get timeout sorry
20:46 <@deen> ddnet_user: hi
20:46 <@deen> auth_add_p Name admin hash
20:47 <@deen> from ddnet/scripts/hash_passwords.py you get the hash
20:50 < ddnet_user> thanks deen is it possible to add access special command for a user ? example "DDNet" user only can use "status"
20:50 < ddnet_user> ?
20:55 <+Learath2> well you could kinda abuse helper
20:55 <@deen> access_level status 2
20:56 <@deen> so you have admin (can do everything), mod (access_level with 1) and helper (access_level with 2)
20:56 <@deen> This kind of stuff should be documented somewhere btw
20:56 <@deen> If someone wants to write something in ddnet github or wiki, please do
20:57 <@deen> Then we can just link people to it instead of explaining it over and over
21:00 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vHaO5
21:00 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master ec5ede7 def: Version 10.6.2
21:02 < ddnet_user> it would be better if that allow you to add some command u want to an user. anyway thanks for explaining , and i have an idea about "top5points"
21:04 < ddnet_user> somthing like ./top5location like ./top5GER its show top5 points of GERMAN guys if you get geoip of players , then every country can see who is in top5points in their country it can be challonge for thems
21:04 <+Learath2> that would require us to rework the permission system as a whole and don't think anyone wants to put in the effort to make a feature that wi'll barely be used
21:08 <@deen> well, we have it on the website, for server locations at least
22:40 <+Ryozuki> deen, pr'ed the changelog
23:11 <@deen> thanks
23:11 <@deen> Ryozuki: what about 10.6.1?
