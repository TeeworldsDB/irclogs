00:36 <@deen> hi
00:38 < DoNe> have you done something for hookrace since the last posts on the blog?
00:38 <@deen> nope, and not planning to
00:38 <@deen> i should shut down the site

01:40 <@deen> Yay, ddnet client for archlinux: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/teeworlds-ddnet/
01:40 <@deen> Anyone from here made that?
02:00 <@deen> gotta vote for it so it gets made into an official archlinux package!
02:02 <@deen> oh, and i found that while looking for ddnet on twitter :P https://twitter.com/search?q=ddnet&src=typd
02:02 <+laxa> make a twitter account !
02:03 <@deen> i don't like twitter
02:04 <+laxa> :(
02:04 <+laxa> Why not, it's pretty cool
02:04 <+laxa> you don't like : twitter/facebook/linkedin
02:04 <+laxa> where can we find you then ? :)
02:05 <@deen> on ddnet
02:05 <+laxa> And when you'll have finished your study, how people will find you ?
02:05 <+laxa> On ddnet too ? :)
02:05 <@deen> i will just disappear and nobody will ever find me again
02:05 <+laxa> xD
02:06 <+laxa> Even if you don't tweet, twitter is damn good to follow the things/people you like.
02:07 <+laxa> And you could make someone have a DDNet twitter account and handling it for you
02:07 <@deen> i just search for my projects on it every few months
02:07 <@deen> to see if something is wrong
02:08 <+laxa> Well, it sures isn't that great if you don't follow much things
02:08 <+laxa> but as time pass, you'll follow more and more things I guess, then it'll be really cool and time saver.
02:09 <@deen> nice http://teedes.ru/viewtopic.php?id=40
02:10 <@deen> hm, half is in russian, half english
02:10 <+laxa> I am wondering where all the russian community is gone
02:10 <+laxa> before, I felt like Konabl4 servers were full etc
02:10 <+laxa> and I feel like ddnet Russian isn't working at all
02:10 <@deen> what?
02:11 <+laxa> or is it ?
02:11 <@deen> we had 70 players on RUS a few days ago
02:11 <+laxa> well, if you have blocker servers
02:11 <@deen> and every day i see 20-30
02:11 <+laxa> that doesn't count
02:11 <@deen> many russians play on ddnet rus or ger
02:12 <+laxa> Hum, maybe I feel like this cause I removed DDNET Rus from my favorites :)
02:12 <@deen> here you go
02:12 <@deen> yesterday (friday) on GER:
02:12 <@deen> 774 players from DE
02:12 <@deen> 224 from RU
02:12 <@deen> 154 from PL
02:12 <@deen> 115 from FR
02:12 <@deen> 71 from BY
02:13 <+laxa> BY ?
02:13 <@deen> 67 from UA
02:13 <+laxa> UA ? xD
02:13 <@deen> Belarus and Ukraine
02:13 <+laxa> well, that's GER servers, I am talking about RUS :)
02:14 <@deen> on RUS: 222 from RU, 118 from DE, 34 from UA, 29 from PL
02:14 <@deen> so russian community is split up between RUS and GER
02:20 <@deen> oh, i didn't know you can request the list of masterserver bans: http://www.stats.teespace.de/?page=bans
02:32 <@deen> nice, 70% of teeworlds on ddnet
02:32 <+laxa> teeworlds is pretty much a dead game
02:32 <+laxa> only ddnet lives
02:33 <+eeeee> whoa
02:33 <@deen> 228/330 players
02:33 <+eeeee> i think it used to be >70% of teeworlds on blocker servers
02:33 <@deen> ah, when i say "ddnet"
02:33 <@deen> i include chilean blocker servers
02:33 <+eeeee> oh okay then
02:33 <@deen> that's 89 players
02:42 <+Nimda> DDNet CHN went down!
02:43 <+Nimda> DDNet CHN went back online!
05:26 <@deen> EastByte: i think we'd need ddnet server support for the accounts after all
05:26 <@deen> I'd like timeout protection to work using accounts instead of timeout codes
05:26 <@deen> we could also use the timeout codes to create accounts
05:27 <@deen> record all timeout codes in use and create account for the name they are usually associated with
05:27 <@deen> then once that player starts ddnet client and logs in for the first time, they're forced to set a new password
05:27 <@deen> hm, maybe not such a good idea
05:31 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/KrELBA
05:31 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 1ea495c def: Update credits
05:37 < shorefire> deen: you around?
05:37 < shorefire> deen: I need to speak to you
09:57 <@EastByte> deen: hm the idea isn't thatb ad
10:05 <+Nimda> DDNet Chile went down!
10:06 <+Nimda> DDNet Chile went back online!
10:36 <@EastByte> deen: we should atleast start logging all timeout codes
10:36 <@EastByte> because they are really trustable
12:06 < cris272> ddos ?
12:06 < ochristi> ?
12:07 < cris272> hard lag on ddnet ger
12:07 < ochristi> I just got lag, wondering if it was my wifi, but apparently no
12:07 < ochristi> :D
12:07 < cris272> it's back
12:07 < cris272> no lags anymore
12:12 < ochristi> and again
12:17 <@EastByte> if it was ddos then it was a weak one
12:31 <@deen> yeah, but weak ones happen
12:31 <@deen> looks like something you could do with a single attacker
12:31 <@deen> something around 2 gbit/
12:31 <@deen> s
12:31 <@deen> Should I make tournament tomorrow or not?
12:33 <@deen> laxa: the yt channel has 52 subscribers
12:34 <@deen> laxa: maybe you're right and it would make sense to have these weird social network channels for ddnet
12:34 <@deen> but I'm not going to set them up :P
12:55 <@EastByte> deen: we really should implement the acc system
12:55 <@EastByte> so many possibilities
12:55 <@deen> yeah
12:55 <@EastByte> I just thought about private skins
12:56 <@EastByte> I don't wanna see random players using the artkis skin

12:58 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 e0a16e0 def: /mapinfo: Show mapper name
13:00 <@EastByte> deen: should we set up some live typing pad (etherepad) to discuss the account system?
13:00 <@deen> no idea how that works
13:00 <@EastByte> espcially because not all details should be public
13:01 <@deen> maybe just start implementing it? :P
13:01 <@EastByte> no :P
13:03 <@EastByte> the async account requesting and stuff needs to be planed through
13:20 <@deen> eeeee: are you here?
13:20 <@deen> hi Savander 
13:21 < Savander> hi deen 
13:21 < Savander> hello
13:22 <+laxa> deen: hey
13:22 <+laxa> I have a little question
13:23 <+laxa> Do you know what exact mousesens value is the "neutral" one on teeworlds ?
13:23 <@deen> 100
13:23 <+laxa> the one that would correspond to raw mouse signal without changing it
13:23 <@deen> i've never changed it
13:23 <+laxa> ok nice
13:23 < Savander> 65pkt!!! :x
13:23 <+laxa> I think you should have an option for that
13:23 <@deen> but i don't know if it's neutral
13:23 <+laxa> cl_raw_mouse
13:24 <+laxa> Ah !
13:24 <@deen> windows isn't neutral either maybe
13:24 <+laxa> yes, if you select 6/11 on windows
13:24 <+laxa> it's neutral
13:24 <+laxa> and corresponds to the input of the mouse itself
13:24 <+laxa> I have learnt this a long time ago when configuring my SC2 settings :)
13:25 <+laxa> I'll ask on #teeworlds
13:31 <@deen> or just read the sourcecode yourself :P
13:31 <@deen> float Fac = (float)(g_Config.m_UiMousesens)/g_Config.m_InpMousesens;
13:31 <@deen> ah no
13:32 <@deen> float Sens = g_Config.m_InpMousesens/100.0f
13:32 <@deen> so 100 is fine
13:43 <@EastByte> afk
14:03 <@deen> Noone responded, should we do a tournament tomorrow? =/
14:03 <+laxa> If you have a map, why not :)
14:03 <@deen> because of ddos attacks
14:04 <@deen> I'm not sure what would happen
14:04 <@deen> I'd expect FRA2 to stay up, but South Africa and Chile would probably go down
14:09 <@deen> guess we can try it
14:51 < BeaR> hey (:
14:51 <@deen> hi
14:51 <@deen> Quick Tournament #21 just announced!
14:54 < BeaR> deen: got the mapsounds working (: https://github.com/cinaera/ddnet/tree/pr_sound
14:54 <@EastByte> well, that's cool
14:55 < BeaR> got pretty big :d
14:55 <@deen> wow, good work, BeaR
14:55 <@EastByte> can you sum up the changes? :)
14:56 < BeaR> EastByte: You can add sound sources which replay some sample in the map, basically like quads
14:56 <@deen> how are they enabled?
14:56 <@EastByte> wow
14:56 <@deen> just by walking close to them?
14:57 < BeaR> yes
14:57 <@EastByte> would love to see a test :D
14:57 <@deen> so they get louder as you get closer?
14:57 < BeaR> you can choose between local sound sources and global
14:57 < BeaR> y
14:57 < BeaR> could add some distance value to the source
14:57 <@deen> Saaviked promised to do a music video as a map :P
14:58 <@deen> can you time them somehow?
14:58 < BeaR> need to add some config to the menu to regulate the volume
14:58 <@EastByte> deen: screw the pro players not playing with sound :P
14:58 <@deen> it would be nice for halloween as well
14:58 <@deen> creating some atmosphere
14:58 <@deen> :P
14:58 <@EastByte> ++
14:59 < BeaR> well they get enqueued at a certain time delay but I think there are some issues with the offset
14:59 <@deen> we have something planned where this would fit in perfectly
14:59 < BeaR> didnt want to adjust the sound interface that much
14:59 <@deen> and i noticed that most people update their ddnet client immediately!
14:59 <@deen> 12 hours after release and most had it updated already
14:59 <@EastByte> how does this happen?
14:59 <@EastByte> okay cool features
14:59 < BeaR> could need some feedback what to improve and need some icon for the editor xd
15:00 <@deen> BeaR: hm, i think it would be nice with a timer
15:00 <+laxa> Help me please guys xD : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26314341/nginx-reverse-proxy-an-apache2-website-url-return-are-not-corresponding-to-pro
15:00 <@EastByte> laxa: still dat problem...
15:00 <@deen> like the envelopes, just for sound
15:00 <@deen> so you can have a sound, then silence for a few minutes, sound again
15:01 < BeaR> k gonna try :D
15:01 <@deen> maybe just add an envelope for Sounds
15:01 <@deen> with volume as the variable
15:02 < BeaR> (1400 loc :d)
15:11 <+laxa> deen: you made a regression on ddrace !
15:11 <+laxa> ghosts are not synced with your time
15:11 <+laxa> ex : you cross a solo start line, your ghost appear
15:12 <+laxa> you cross it again : your ghost come back at start but your time doesn't reset
15:13 <@deen> that's because you're on a team in solo server
15:13 <@deen> try and fix it
15:13 <+laxa> nop
15:13 <+laxa> I am not in team
15:17 < Maple> deen, nice hall of fame layout
15:17 <@deen> thanks
15:17 <@deen> I told you to make it but you didn't!
15:19 <@deen> oh and, laxa, now the halloffame is created by a script
15:19 <+laxa> ok
15:20 <@deen> so, if you have a new entry you can give it to me in the input format for the script :P
15:21 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/halloffame
15:21 <@deen> like this
15:22 <@deen> laxa: any plan to make twitter/facebook/whatever accounts?
15:23 <+laxa> EastByte: have you been disconnected from TS just right now ?
15:23 <@EastByte> for 3 times I think
15:23 <+laxa> wtf
15:23 <+laxa> weird guys came, linux guys
15:23 <+laxa> server didn't crashed
15:23 <+laxa> but everyone was dropped
15:23 <+laxa> ...
15:23 <@EastByte> haah
15:23 <@deen> haha
15:23 <@EastByte> cool linux guys
15:23 <+laxa> 3 times
15:24 <@deen> good to know that teeworlds is not the only server with problems like that :P
15:24 <+laxa> well, I don't know how it's even possible
15:24 <+laxa> I should ask on TS forums...
15:32 <@deen> any opinions about adding portals (like in Portal and PPRace) to ddnet?
15:32 <@deen> (I'm against it, some others for it)
15:32 <@EastByte> a portal gun?
15:32 <@deen> yes
15:33 <@EastByte> would mark as maybe for later
15:33 <@deen> yes, i did that 1 year ago :P
15:33 <@deen> now people are asking again
15:33 < DoNe> xD
15:34 <@EastByte> well might be an additional race element
15:34 <@EastByte> though I prefer to play plain ddrace
15:34 <@deen> i think it wouldn't be popular with the mappers
15:34 <@deen> and it's too complicated
15:34 <@deen> players hate complicated stuff
15:34 < DoNe> its not complicated
15:34 <@EastByte> I think so too
15:35 <@EastByte> at deen
15:35 < DoNe> its just one tile
15:35 < DoNe> okay 2 if you add a tile to clear portals
15:35 <@deen> and you need a gun for portals
15:35 <@deen> and set /1 and /2
15:35 < DoNe> the normal gun
15:35 <@EastByte> deen: just tell them (or DoNe ) that it might get realistic if all players use the ddnet client :P
15:35 <@deen> even then i wouldn't like it
15:36 < DoNe> you would set portals rotative
15:36 < DoNe> why it would be more realistic if all players would use ddclient?
15:36 <@deen> then you can have visual indications of what's happening
15:36 <@deen> and don't need stuff like /1 and /2
15:37 <@EastByte> ++
15:37 < DoNe> [15:36] <DoNe> you would set portals rotative
15:37 < DoNe> its so easy
15:37 <@deen> look at extended teleporters, they are similar i think
15:37 < DoNe> yes
15:37 <@deen> they are also complicated, mappers and players don't like them
15:37 < DoNe> but for weapons not for players
15:38 <@deen> probably was a mistake to add them
15:38 < DoNe> i liked the maps
15:38 <@deen> yeah, me too
15:38 <@deen> Jetpack on the other hand was the best addition
15:38 < DoNe> there are 2 maps and then every1 fogets about it
15:38 <@deen> it's extremely simple, everyone understands it
15:38 <@deen> everyone loves jetpack
15:38 <@deen> (even Tsin)
15:38 < DoNe> :D
15:39 < DoNe> but maybe people would like it too
15:39 < DoNe> you cant tell 
15:39 <@deen> there were some other good ideas for complicated gameplay additions
15:39 < DoNe> i think for solomaps it would be cool
15:40 <@deen> 645654 & phacrum wanted to change the objective of ddrace. you have to get a flag and bring it to the finish line. you can throw the flag around to other players, and stuff like that
15:40 < DoNe> :D
15:40 < DoNe> i like the idea
15:40 < DoNe> but it would destroy every map
15:41 <@deen> just need a setting to enable it on some maps
15:41 < Maple> DDCtf
15:41 < Maple> that was fun
15:41 < DoNe> lol
15:41 < Maple> i made a map where
15:41 < Maple> you had to ddrace through
15:41 < Maple> to go get the flag
15:41 < Maple> and come back
15:41 < Maple> it was pretty hard
15:42 < DoNe> haha
15:42 < DoNe> for vanilla ctf?
15:42 <@deen> jetpack on vanilla gametype would also be nice :P
15:42 < DoNe> vanilla people hate everything new
15:42 <@EastByte> jetpack sucks
15:43 <@EastByte> always reminds me to these crazy mods
15:43 < DoNe> im 100% sure that u can do more inovative parts with portals then with jetpack
15:43 < DoNe> than*
15:43 < Maple> but it already exists
15:43 < DoNe> did not know about this
15:43 < Maple> ddnet is about innovation
15:44 < DoNe> there is 1 map for PPRace
15:44 <@deen> no, there are more
15:44 < DoNe> oh
15:44 < DoNe> hmh showed it to me
15:44 < DoNe> but i dont like it
15:45 < DoNe> it looks glitchy and there are to many things
15:47 < DoNe> well there are 3 maps :D
15:58 <@EastByte> deen: ` <- is my ts push to talk bind
15:58 <@deen> ^^
15:58 <@EastByte> so you always know which window I have open and how long I talk
15:59 <@EastByte> dunno why I chosed that key
16:36 <@deen> Hm, BeaR is gone
16:37 <@deen> I have a crash in his new sound branch: http://ddnet.tw/pr_sound.log
16:43 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
16:43 <+Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 315
16:43 <+Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 532 users online at 2014-09-28 20:14:41
17:07 <@deen> 16:36 <@deen> Hm, BeaR is gone
17:07 <@deen> 16:37 <@deen> I have a crash in his new sound branch: http://ddnet.tw/pr_sound.log
17:08 < BeaR> deen: thx (:
17:08 <@deen> not sure if i should make a pull request for your pull request branch :P
17:09 < BeaR> no need, can fix it quickly (probably) :D
17:14 < BeaR> fixed :)
17:22 <@deen> shouldn't the files from data/audio show when you want to add a sound?
17:23 <@deen> hm, you also use the mapres dir for sounds
17:24 <@deen> then you can't use external sounds that everyone already has
17:24 <@deen> hi Welf_ 
17:24 < Welf_> hey
17:25 < BeaR> I only use the mapres file, wouldn't use the audio files also /:
17:25 <@deen> ok
17:26 <@deen> guess we have to embed everything then
17:26 <@deen> and only wavpack works i guess
17:26 < BeaR> currently it's the only thing supported as far as I know
17:26 < BeaR> you can also copy some files to the mapres folder
17:27 < BeaR> sth like spawn sound shouldn't be used imho
17:27 <@deen> well, those are the only high quality teeish sounds we have
17:27 < BeaR> libsndfile could be useful
17:30 <@deen> wvpack alone is probably fine for now
17:30 <@deen> I wish indexed pngs would work in teeworlds
17:31 <@deen> could half every map size
17:32 < BeaR> well I wish, we could remove all the embedded stuff :D
17:32 <@deen> and instead?
17:32 < BeaR> request all the assets from the server
17:33 < BeaR> map only holds references (name + checksum)
17:33 <@deen> sharing maps becomes more difficult then
17:34 < BeaR> a bit, but not that much imho
17:34 < BeaR> I guess 70% of the ddnet maps have the same standard images embedded :d
17:34 <@deen> yeah, that would save so much bandwidth
17:35 <@deen> could get cheaper chilean servers
17:35 <@EastByte> we would need some kind of resource transmitting system :d
17:35 <@deen> same as map download
17:35 <@deen> but it's a bit buggy with high ping and sometimes gets stuck
17:35 <@deen> reportedly during the last tournament =/
17:36 <@EastByte> yea dl was pretty lame
17:36 < BeaR> already implemented sth like that, worked pretty fine but not useable as I would break compatibility with standard client
17:37 <@deen> BeaR: well, the server could take the normal maps, extract out a map without embedded images
17:37 <@deen> and send that to people with new ddnet client
17:38 <@deen> but it's probably too much work
17:38 <@EastByte> ^ hello vanilla support
17:39 <+Nimda> Server was removed : DDNet GER!
17:39 <+Nimda> Server was removed : DDNet FRA!

17:40 <@deen> I just changed some names on http://ddnet.tw/status
17:40 <@deen> instead of FRA & FRA2 they are now called ddnet.tw and FRA
17:41 <@EastByte> hmkay
17:42 <@deen> I'll make the broadcast to get ddnet client for players who don't have it
17:42 <@deen> when they join
17:42 <@deen> i hope they won't kill me for it
17:42 <@deen> but I've seen 3 people today who couldn't continue becaue they didn't have ddnet client
17:43 <@EastByte> yea take the first step into ddnet client enforcement^^
17:43 <@EastByte> deen: what was the problem there?
17:44 <@deen> one had ping 400 and couldn't do the jetpack part because of missing prediction
17:44 <@deen> another had vanilla client and had no prediction for hookthrough
17:44 <@deen> and the third couldn't save his partner because of no +showhookcoll
17:45 < DoNe> how to simulate solo server (i forgot)
17:45 <@deen> https://github.com/def-/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/servers/types/solo/flexreset.cfg
17:46 <@deen> which is way too difficult, we should have sv_solo_server 1 and 0, hm
17:47 < BeaR> https://github.com/def-/ddnet/blob/DDRace64/src/engine/client/sound.cpp#L450 wtf :D
17:47 <@deen> yes?
17:48 <@deen> ah yeah, that's weird code I wrote
17:48 < DoNe> whats sv_team 3?
17:48 < BeaR> in the engine code :D?
17:48 <@deen> i don't remember, but i had to put it there for some reason
17:48 <@deen> maybe you can fix it
17:49 <@deen> it's also possible that i wrote this code long before ddnet and just didn't care
17:49 <@deen> because chat sound always annoyed me
17:49 < BeaR> dunno, whould just move it to CSounds out of the engine into game client
17:51 <@deen> go ahead
17:52 < DoNe> created a "rollercoaster" part, deen suggested to make a rollercoaster map when petjack was released
17:52 < DoNe> if you want to try flw me
17:59 <@EastByte> ordered a "gameboard" for gaming now
17:59 <@EastByte> my current keyboard only works for coding^^
18:01 < eart> which one?
18:01 < eart> http://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/ZERO_DK2087.html - currently have this one and love it
18:01 <@EastByte> a4tech g100
18:02 <@EastByte> or do you mean my keyboard?
18:02 < eart> ye, which one you ordered ^^
18:03 <@EastByte> orderd a4tech g100 for gaming and working with noppoo cherry mx red
18:03 < eart> red switches are easily my favorite thus far
18:04 < eart> that a4tech g100 looks pretty neat
18:04 < eart> never knew those existed :O
18:04 <@EastByte> well don't want to have 2 big keyboards on my desk^^
18:05 < eart> idd, would be worth trying :)
18:10 <+Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
18:11 <@deen> no ddos, they're doing weird stuff at Harmony-Hosting
18:11 <@deen> ...
18:11 <@deen> the firewall says " Modification en cours "
18:11 <@EastByte> hoster definitly works in harmony
18:12 <@deen> 2 days with them, 2 downtimes
18:12 <@deen> :P
18:12 <+Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
18:13 <@EastByte> but the dedi keeps running right?
18:13 <@deen> this time yes
18:13 <@EastByte> haha
18:13 <+Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
18:13 <@deen> now i'm scared for tomorrow because of the hoster, not ddos
18:14 <@deen> an uptime of 99.9% is actually bad
18:14 <+Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
18:14 <@EastByte> indeed
18:14 <@deen> that means they are down for 90 minutes every day?
18:15 <@EastByte> I think it's just an indicator for "nah, not always online"
18:15 <@deen> nono, it's actual measured uptime: https://www.harmony-hosting.com/help/monitoring/
18:15 <@deen> we're on Marge
19:18 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:18 <+Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 344
19:18 <+Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 532 users online at 2014-09-28 20:14:41
19:20 <+laxa> fuck girls
19:20 <+laxa> so complicated
19:20 <@EastByte> you are talking about anqel I guess
19:20 <+laxa> anqel : "I am not interested in a friendship with someone living in another country"
19:20 <+laxa> ...
19:21 <@deen> sounds pragmatic
19:21 <+laxa> !en-fr pragmatic
19:21 <+Nimda> Translation: pragmatique
19:23 <+Nimda> DDNet FRA went down!
19:25 <+laxa> Ok
19:25 <+laxa> If I want to be friend with Anqel
19:25 <+laxa> I need to get german nationality
19:25 <+laxa> any idea how ?
19:25 <@deen> 19:23 <deen> wow, FRA down again...
19:25 <@deen> 19:24 <EastByte> ...
19:25 <@deen> 19:24 <deen> no ddos
19:25 <@deen> 19:24 <deen> nice, dedi down again
19:25 <@deen> 19:24 <deen> so much for the tournament tomorrow! haha
19:25 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
19:25 <+Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 355
19:25 <+Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 532 users online at 2014-09-28 20:14:41
19:26 <@deen> laxa: kill someone german and assume their identity
19:26 <+laxa> xD
19:26 <+laxa> I'll go kill vali
19:27 <+laxa> Oh, I don't need to become German, just needs to live in germany
19:27 <+laxa> easier :)
19:40 <@EastByte> laxa is horrible if it comes to woman
19:40 <+laxa> what ?!
19:49 <+Nimda> DDNet FRA went back online!
19:53 <@deen> they sounded pretty defensive on the HH channel
19:53 <@deen> that they can't have 100% uptime and all
19:53 <@deen> but 4 downtimes in 24 hours is pretty bad
19:54 <+laxa> they are definitively not prefessionnal enough
19:55 <+laxa> I can say you that from what I have read in the last 24 hours
19:55 <@deen> yeah, i figured that much
19:55 <+laxa> it's just a bunch of kids/really young people
19:55 <@deen> still better than the chilean server!
19:56 <+laxa> it's really a little organisation
19:56 <+laxa> They are doing it by passion more than anything else
19:56 <+laxa> the creator doesn't live from this project
19:56 <+laxa> I asked him
19:56 <@deen> which is fine, they're pretty cheap
19:56 <+laxa> going to eat, brb
19:57 <@deen> ddnet is also just for fun
19:58 <@deen> I'll still ask them if i can expect the server to stay up tomorrow for the tournament
19:58 <@deen> otherwise I'll just run it on the kimsufi one
20:44 <+laxa> deen: would teeworlds works in 4K ?
20:44 <@deen> sure
20:44 <@deen> and 8k
20:45 <@deen> but vector graphics from hookrace would be better!
20:45 <@EastByte> :D
20:45 <+laxa> hookrace is dead
20:45 <+laxa> you said it yourself :)
20:45 <@deen> it won't look better than with 2k
20:45 <@deen> except for text
21:11 <+laxa> a guy renting a server at harmony hosting was ddosing
21:11 <+laxa> he got booted xD
21:11 <@EastByte> wut
21:11 <+laxa> Chk: it's forbidden by the law !
21:11 <+laxa> guy ddosing: really ?
21:47 <+laxa> deen: wanna join our webcam call ?
21:48 <@deen> haha
21:48 <@EastByte> even I am in there^^
21:48 <@deen> i don't do audio and now you want me to do video? :P
21:48 <+laxa> east is with us !
22:22 < DoNe> hi
22:22 < DoNe> auf meinem homeserver werden die zeiten im scoreboard nichtmehr angezeigt wenn man neu connected
22:23 < DoNe> bei rank und top5 bleiben sie
22:25 < DoNe> jemand hier?
22:47 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 2 new commits to DDRace64: http://git.io/ilTiaQ

23:01 <+laxa> !fr-en poire
23:01 <+Nimda> Translation: pear
23:19 < DoNe> hi
23:20 <@deen> that's a fast connect and disconnect
23:24 <@deen> hi DoNe 
23:24 <@deen> DoNe: i think that's normal on a filebased server
23:24 <@deen> i only implemented the proper one for mysql-based
23:29 < DoNe> but that would be easy to do 
23:30 <@deen> yes
23:31 < DoNe> on ddnet.tw settings and commands is a link to client settings but there are no client settings
23:31 <@deen> you can do it if you want, i don't see a need for it

23:34 < DoNe> is there a way to reset every serversetting to default?
23:35 <@deen> not every, but some
23:35 <@deen> sv_tune_reset, sv_ddrace_tune_reset
23:53 <@deen> bear: it's beautiful!
23:53 <@deen> i love it
23:53 < bear> ty
23:53 < bear> wot did i do
23:53 <@deen> bear: pr_sound
23:53 <@deen> i'm testing it, works perfectly so far
23:53 < bear> i just idle here, nothing else
23:54 <@deen> oh, you're not BeaR?
23:54 < bear> i do not think im the bear you are thinking of
23:57 <@deen> weird that we have 2 bears in this channel
23:59 < bear> ive always had the nick bear on quakenet :p
