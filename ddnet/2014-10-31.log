21:40 <@EastByte> is it h-client or dd-client?
21:40 <@EastByte> oh both links are the same
21:41 <@EastByte> KinG_: how does the bot help?
21:42 < KinG_> it's so difficult to say
21:42 < KinG_> http://uploadboy.com/pfneyu8n4dw5.html
21:42 < KinG_> this is the bot link
21:45 < KinG_> press ctrl+x then select what u want
21:45 < KinG_> and middle mouse button will enable it
21:51 <@EastByte> can't run the binary
21:55 <@EastByte> okay runs on win7
22:01 < KinG_> u could use it?!
22:01 < KinG_> which server are u in?!
22:05 <@EastByte> nah my vm is too slow to run tw properly
22:06 <@EastByte> and everything I tested didn't work or was buggy
22:07 < KinG_> come to a server and let me show it to you

22:35 <@deen> sounds like another try of KinG to get people to download his exe files^^
22:36 <@deen> EastByte: how was the bot?
22:36 <@EastByte> you think so?
22:36 <@deen> no, probably not^^
22:36 <@EastByte> I didn't understand the bot
22:37 <@EastByte> there is a big menu with all kind ob botting features
22:37 <@EastByte> but when I tried them only strange things happened
22:38 <@deen> hm
22:39 <@EastByte> probably because of the vm
22:44 <@EastByte> https://eastbit.net/priv/jikscl.png

22:45 <@EastByte> the ddnet version seems to be pretty old
