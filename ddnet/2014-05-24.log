22:41 <@deen> ok
22:41 < alebrije> i updated my OS from ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04
22:43 < alebrije> and i use the free, open source driver (ATI) instead of the privative on my system and all games runs very well
22:43 < alebrije> That people do it very well with this driver
22:45 <@deen> nice
22:46 < alebrije> but teeworlds dont, sometimes give me some kind of lag, not for my connection, its local lag (not much). I dont know what happened with Teeworlds
22:46 < alebrije> :(

22:46 <@deen> Try changing gfx_finish
22:46 <@deen> and gfx_vsync
22:47 < alebrije> yep vsync is turning off
22:47 < alebrije> and the other one dont know was that, :P
22:47 < alebrije> whats gfx_finish?
22:48 <@deen> waiting for gpu to finish rendering
22:48 < alebrije> gfx_finish = 1
