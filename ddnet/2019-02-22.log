16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> how can we know the hexacode of our tee ?
16:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> how can we know the color hexacode of our tee ?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> "we" "our" xd?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Skin colors are not represented in hex i think there is some converter somehwere in the code but idk.
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> You can go to the ingame console and type ``player_body` and ``dummy_body`` or with color appended to it not sure play with completion
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> but these values arent hex
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> maybe he wants to draw his tee
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> take a screenshot and use a colorpicker lel
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ^
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Bumm> +1
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Oh sry xd
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Using "we" for a question like this is common in french , mb
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Ddnet seems to use HSL but player_body doesn't give either a HSL or HEX code so idk how to do it
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> Ddnet seems to use HSL but player_body doesn't give either a HSL or HEX value so idk how to do it
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im 2lazy to look at code
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :frozen:
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> itâ€™s upscaled hsl so that dark colors arenâ€™t possible
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Oh yeah I also need this converter
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Because I have an old project here just laying around
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> https://dark-the.me/is-the-only-theme/6c33abl5d2.png
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> Idk why it looks blurry
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> But I found a way to apply the colors but I can't apply them if I don't know how to get them
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> I want to make a slider and also a box where you input your `player_body` and it converts it and applies
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> copy tw code then
18:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <archimede67> who owns https://dark-the.me ?
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> I am looking at it right now too lol
18:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> half finished website ðŸ˜„
18:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Gwendal> @jao so lightning is like 50 to 0 ? D:
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> boo
