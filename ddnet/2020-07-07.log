00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> __int128 seems to optimize even worse
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://godbolt.org/z/iL8fVm
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> dunno what you're talking about, unsigned __int128 optimizes slightly better for `check_flag` and is the same optimum for `add`
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's been a while since I checked it, I think it was optimized less consistently across compilers
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (and isn't supported at all in MSVC)
00:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> besides https://godbolt.org/z/BSAXzu std::bitset optimizes better in all compilers, if all you want is checking and setting bits
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> oops
00:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (atleast it optimizes to less instructions, I know that doesn't always mean better performance and it'd probably be impossible to predict with the insane pipelines of new cpus)
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> s\/optimizes/generates/
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nah, should be better
00:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no branches
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you want to do arithmetic though, _int128 does work if it exists
00:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> arithmetic optimized fine in my own impl too
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> + and - are trivial, / and * are the ones that are hard to get right
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Most important DDNet dev change my mind
00:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/729824133499846727/robot.png
00:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> most important ddnet bug tester*
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> :troll:
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Most important DDNet dev**,** change my mind
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the comma really helps
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > Most important DDNet dev**,** change my mind
00:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 and funnily enough, clang optimizes both your add and the native add to the exact same instructions, which is shorter than the gcc one
00:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hum
00:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> and without using compiler intrinsics, the msvc one just looks abysmal ðŸ˜„
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://godbolt.org/z/EgMHWm
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> even with the intrinsics the code generated is just not as clean as clang and gcc, but atleast it's readable
00:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it sets up a stack
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe you need that due to SSEH
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> SEH*
00:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It also actually calls the constructor
00:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it should be a trivial constructor to inline, I wonder why it won't
00:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol there is no /O3 in msvc that's why
00:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> at /O2 it looks better, still not as cute as clang or gcc
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> found a bug where the score hud at the bottom right corner doesnt show
01:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> i downloaded ddnet source with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet` and ran it with the cmake gui for windows on visual studio 2017

10:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/rtc-run-time-error-checks?view=vs-2019 could enable /RTC1 on ci
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> yea sqlite is crazy well tested
11:07 <+ChillerDragon> the lite name might be confusing its acually very pro imo :D
11:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sqlpro? ðŸ˜‰
11:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Should we get rid of the very meh file score backend for an sqlite one?
11:52 <+bridge> [freenode] <Zwelf> I actually did that over the weekend. I'll try to make the PR today.
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \o/
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2671
12:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Can we add smth like that in ddnet ðŸ˜‚
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Would require quite a lot of work to get into an acceptable form
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Trafalgar Law didn't you say you tested #2433 and it worked mostly fine?
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2433
12:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> deen seems to have had a very different experience ðŸ˜„
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Zwelf: Very cool!
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> @Learath2 I tested it yea, as I said the most problem was the double msges
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen you sure the same ip check wasn't messing with you?
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> And the vote was not abored, after the vote caller left the srv
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they were connected with 3 different ips, checked in `status`
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I know what went wrong there
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Talking about code testing in SQL databases, I just got my first patent in that area. Should be granted in about a week. But I should really write a paper about it because patents in lawyer-speak are hard to understand.
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are there lawyers that specialize in software patents? I'd be surprised if most lawyers could really adequately put this stuff in legalese
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen the last commit should fix the voting issue
12:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 maybe ddnet has the same problem with 0.7 register as the normal 0.7 server
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> does it? I didn't notice losing master connection
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i have no idea, you said something about not registering
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> some messages up
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Votes
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
12:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> He mean votes
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Look up :P
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ok
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> lol
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 yeah, the one we had was a former engineer who then became a lawyer on top, so he's really good at understanding the technical descriptions we gave him
12:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 just tried, the vote for 0.7 player still doesn't register on kick vote
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it also shows 50% voted already, so I think the 0.7 player is totally getting ignored there
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but for map votes it works
12:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, I fixed what I saw by looking at the code, I'll take a better look tonight
12:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It'd be nice if you could take a look where the vote disappears, but if you don't have the time I'll fix it sooner or later

15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> sure

15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> np ðŸ™‚
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Why isn't the error message at the bottom -.-
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why the error doesn't immediately stop cmake
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's not a warning
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can do that (FATAL_ERROR), but then it won't report all errors
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, true
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @Learath2 How do I get started with the 0.7 support? Is there a setting I need to enable? Do I need to convert maps myself and where to put them?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I'm adding it to trashmap
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You only need maps in the maps7 folder
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's it, it's enabled by default
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Okay great
17:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> So when ddnet rtx in vr?
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TortiLeq> :kek:
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> @deen vacotion already over ðŸ¤” ?
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chumtoad> when teeworlds on nintendo ds
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I tried to compile it for switch but the reverse engineered libraries just weren't far enough along
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chumtoad> oh lol
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro and for the conversion map_convert_07 is what we use
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/730101906277662748/IMG_20200707_123934.jpg
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> That is okay?
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> Is that okay?
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok in what sense?
19:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> I think how he placed translation
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/730115509864890428/Untitled.png
19:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> did hook collision always work like this on solo servers?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I don't think it should
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what client version?
19:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> works for me on current client
19:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> Wasnt there a bug too where hookcolls colored when they crossed at their ends?
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> newest ddnet
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> 14.1
19:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TearlessAbyss46> I think it was cause by the unsolo tiles that are in the solo map xD
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Is it possible to reconnect with the master srv?
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> Because my server lost the connection to the master srv from 0.7
20:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <FeaRZ> @deen Ok in the sense that if it is well written to translate it
20:04 <+ChillerDragon> restart server @Trafalgar Law
20:04 <+ChillerDragon> btw check wire
20:05 <+ChillerDragon> maybe you have a similar issue like @fokkonaut has see #teeworlds for details
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> After the restart the srv has still no connection to the master srv?
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Trafalgar Law> I can't see the srv
20:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @TearlessAbyss46 yeah, unsolo tiles shouldn't even exist in solo map. do they work?
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> maybe the mapper thought it would be cool to be able to play the map without the solo map setting
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> but u dont need unsolo tiles for that because u dont even need solotiles
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <á¶°Â°KonÍ§sti> @deen they work like they should but by server setting sv_soloserver 1 everx interacting with other tees is impossible so u cant hook them but the hookcoll thinks u can because its not like a "u cant hook other tees" tile
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <!gerdoe> cool bug
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 works, can you take a look at the code? https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/4e0abd5e430781e0f206a934fbee6b40e88fd96f
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nils> hi, the new smooth zoom is annoying me and for some reason the config flag is not working for me. am i doing something wrong?
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nils> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/730160030988369931/ddnet_zoom.png
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nils> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/730160069957648515/ddnet_zoom2.png
22:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @nils there is no flag to disable the smooth zoom
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nils> but the second picture is from the commit the smooth zoom was added. it shows the flag
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Patiga> in which way is it annoying you?
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @nils no, that screenshot is from https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2420/files, which we did *not* merge. Instead we took https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2429/files
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nils> @Patiga i am zooming quite alot while playing and the animation is just braking my focus
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen he is right, it annoys me too
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> thats why i was against the removal of a config option by @heinrich5991
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nils> oh i'm sorry @deen didn't see that it wasn't merged. but the setting would be a blessing
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @fokkonaut if that was why, why didn't you say sth? smh
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We should add the config option back, and add a special case for 0
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> done
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 ^
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nils> but i need a setting to turn it off, not to tweak the time. or should i set cl_smooth_zoom_time to 0 now?
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i heavily agree with nils
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> i dont undersand u can implement such stuff with no off option
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 0 is the same as off
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> no need to have two options imo
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nils> well ok, thanks alot :)
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> fair enough then
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @snail our combination of options grows exponentially with each added options, we can't possible test all, thus we end up having more bugs
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> yeah ik
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> so I can understand the motivation not to introduce more options
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> but that option literally changes the gameplay when using zoom
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <snail> :justatest:
23:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nils> @Patiga i am zooming quite alot while playing and the animation is just breaking my focus
23:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen doesn't this cause a SIGFPE?
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `return (CurrentTime - m_ZoomSmoothingStart) / (m_ZoomSmoothingEnd - m_ZoomSmoothingStart);` would be `(Now - Now) / (Now - Now)` which is not only division by 0 but also 0/0 ðŸ˜„
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> locally it worked, I didn't even look at the calculation ðŸ˜„
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe I got lucky and the floats are not exact enough?
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> hi can someone fact check some facts for a video im making
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 1. strong and week hook existed from the beginning of tw
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> 2. whoever was spawned first gets strong
