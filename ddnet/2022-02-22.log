04:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> When pull request is closed, what then? It's getting rejected, accepted what 🤔
05:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Usually its getting merged then

10:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> @deen can I ask for another server request? It will be the last one from me. So there is 'fng japan' server, which Korean players play a lot because there is no Korean FNG server. Actually, it's almost all Korean players. So we're just wondering if you can host an FNG server for Korea as well.
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @noby you want to host it on korea too? ^
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> @noby korea wants to cooperate with usa
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mikdad> Where can I find tool skins like this one?
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mikdad> Image
10:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mikdad> Image
10:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @mikdad you haven't actually sent skins
10:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <mikdad> I have found
10:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> lmao tf
11:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> wtf happened
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> it's a new feature
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> 
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> image of my coding setup
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> 
11:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> Image
11:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Damn i cannot finish my new map without the weapon shields :pepe:
11:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> make a teleporter that gives you the weapons needed but not the one you want to remove
11:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Ik thats exactly what im not wanting to do
11:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> And its not possible like that 
11:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Ima just wait till the weapon shields get released
11:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> why do you have vertical monitors
11:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why do u have weeb background
11:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> interesting what your first imaginations are
11:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ryo is a weeb, zombietoad wannts epic coding setups xD
12:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you like delete the image? :D
12:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> is it me or no images are shown
12:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ah it's a troll
12:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> wtf
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> i can still see them, here's a screenshot
13:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <bencie> Image
13:15 <+seemslegit> imagine
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Image
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> today is
13:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 2022/02/22
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 20220222
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or 22022022
13:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> fits betters
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> gotta wait for 22:22:22.2222 o'clock
13:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> finish a race with 22:22.22 minutes
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> then you are a legend xd
13:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
13:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks did u rework the vid recorder in vulkan?
13:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it possible to render the video at 60fps but in like 1second? xd
13:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for me there is no benefit on using the demo recorder over obs due to that rn
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think it was due to the sound being a problem
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> yes
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> its very fast now
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and sound works fine?
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats epic
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> yeah i also fixed 96000 hz sound, but have to push the changes
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is the most poggers update
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PepeA:
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> well it maxes out at around 85% CPU usage for me
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> finally i can render 2 hour demos without wasting 2 hours in pc
13:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> yes
13:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> no idea why it cant reach 100% xd
13:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cant wait for ddnet 16.0
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen did u see the <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4267> ?
13:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if ddnet 16.0 also has tutorial i think it might be good to add the tooltips too
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> what good is the tooltip code without any explanations?
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah u want me to add the tooltips?
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> and if we have a text for the tooltip, then why not display it directly on the screen?
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u mean without a tooltip?
13:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Yes
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because it doesnt fit?
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I'm not sure how useful they are
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> isnt that how everyone does it?
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> browsers do it too
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I thought the idea was for the tooltips to guide you where to go
13:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> as a kind of tutorial for the UI, but seems not
13:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Maybe I just can't imagine what should be done with it
13:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> but if we have a button "Connect" and the tooltip says "Connect to server" this doesn't feel useful
13:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> e.g. the editor pen says Open the editor
13:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> bcs the pen isnt intuitive
13:41 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> But I don't think I'm the right person to go through and annotate the entire UI
13:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it allows to explain some settings in more detail for example
13:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i'd say it useful especially for settings and icononized buttons
13:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> or stuff that isnt directly clear
13:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> 
13:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> "Click to add player as friend" in the server details player list
13:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 85% ppl dont know what this does and wether they should enable them

13:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "oh i just installed this game 5 mins ago, what are text entities?
13:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is a quad
13:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is old mouse mode?
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> antiping??
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> surely it must be good!
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd

13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh look a ghost!!!
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> yeah its fine, maybe deen misunderstood, that he does not need todo that xD
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> sounded like he fears to go through the UI and do it himself
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sry for the sarcasm xd
13:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> :boo:
13:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no i can do most of it and we can ask others what would need expplanations
13:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we will need to oask for translations tho
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in german date order, it's a palindrome:
13:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 22.02.2022
13:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> servers up
14:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> Why is DDNet persian gone again :monkaS:
14:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> How will you divide between korean players and actual bots? :monkaS:
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> same way the jpn server did it
14:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> by banning them anyway :kek:
14:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> so u rather ban innocent players than letting one bot play?
14:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> konsti didnt have time to ask persian owner to insert ranks
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/945675709219762196/output.mp4
14:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks @deen
14:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
14:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, looks good, maybe make the position of the tooltip fixed so it doesn't move with the mouse?
14:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
14:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i like it moves with the mouse xd
14:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> feels more responsive
14:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> unless you have parkinson :monkaS:
14:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> in all seriousness there are actually very very few false positives on jpn server
14:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> but yes as a whole across all servers occasionally innocent people get flagged
14:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <noby> which i believe is worth being able to prevent bots from ruining the game
14:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> can it do multi line btw?
15:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks no, cuz ur text width function is broken for multiline, it resets to 0 iirc
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> there is a member in SCursor that is "BiggestLineWidth" or smth
15:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> that can be used for such stuff
15:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> O
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> perf tool on linux and intel documentation are such a pain in the ass to find what you want 😦
15:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i need to make at least a commit other than translation for ddnet 16, but don't know what i can do 😦
15:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I have one for you
15:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> skins.cpp:L238-239 are both wrong, I just couldn't find time to fix it
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> xD good luck fixing it without breaking some skins xD
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/skins.cpp#L238-L239 this?
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> what's wrong with that?
15:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but yeah the skin greyscale code is really weird
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No no
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yeah i agree, but it would break everyone's personification skin
15:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> so we would need a legacy mode and the new one
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If m_Format != FORMAT_RGBA the *4 is wrong
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> it should be * Step
15:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> But even that would be wrong
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ah you want to support RGB skins?
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> when does this make sense?
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think you should pretend alpha is 255
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not sure, but the rest of the code supports it, so that part should too
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ok, but you'll have intransparent squares
15:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> As is now, you'll get a nice buffer overflow loading a RGB skin I think 😄
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> generally RGB is not desirable format, GPUs want 4byte or 1 byte alignment
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but not 3 bytes
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay, then your PR can be removing this useless branching 😄
15:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> true 😄
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <pryzed> I cant Start DDNet Network Client with Steam. What can I do to fix this?! Thx ♥
15:27 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <pryzed> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/945688339913261056/Steam_Dateifehler.PNG
15:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> looks like it wants to run the server
15:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <pryzed> but I always klick on DDrace Network Desktop App. And not open a Lan svr or smt... and if I want Start DDnet it try's to Update and stopps direktly and than this Error comes
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> mhh really weird, maybe reinstall and create a new desktop reference
15:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i dunno how exactly you start it from desktop has steam created it for you?
15:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <pryzed> Yeah it is from Steam. And it is the Same problem if I start the game via Steam
15:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <pryzed> OKOK I will try to reinstall. 😄
15:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/945690565037666355/RDT_20220222_153519531940979751371156.jpg
15:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2
15:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Missing the frame where the top guy becomes a skeleton from the waiting
15:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> why aren't they changing the default wait time for desktops
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> 
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> I mean, if it's such a meme they must have been quite a bit of discussion about that, shouldn't there?
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> @Chairn you wanted a task
15:43 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's because poettering is a huge narcissist, I bet he thinks he knows better than everyone so he won't let them even discuss it
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> Ok :/
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> really weird, especially if its a component that is not writing to disk
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> for those it almost doesnt matter anyway
15:44 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> meh, i don't use steam, so i have no way to test this
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> the normal ddnet server does this too 😄
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> then remove the RGB support in skins.cpp 😄
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> xD
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> he used 
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> netsh winsock reset
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> chkdsk c: /f /r /x
15:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> in cmd and it works now if anyone else has the problem
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <pryzed> @HappyFray helped me in direktly Discord Call with CMD Commands chkdsk c: /f /r /x
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <pryzed> netsh winsock reset and PC restart. Now I reinstalled it and it worked. Thx to all! ♥
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ok nice 😄
15:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Happyfray customer call support :poggers:
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> How did that even help?
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm of confusion
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> yeah xD
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> his game is on D:, and he checks C:
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> probs it was the restart xD
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> it was a permission problem from steam on the drive
15:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> that would be classic windows
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ok 😄
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> chkdsk fixed the permission problem
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <HappyFray> thats why it helped
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> always interesting how this even happens in first place
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, only allah himself knows what's going on there
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> who is that?
15:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> a new dev? 😛
15:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only we had an omnipotent omniscient deity as a contributor
15:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i can't even find the definition for `CreateSqliteConnection`
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> m_SvSqliteFile
15:55 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> in server.cpp
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> damn stupid vscode
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> could just move it to the save dir
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> it cannot find it, but grep did ^
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i use vscodium
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> so its basically also vscode
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> and i found it xd
15:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> and obviously, now it does...
15:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i miss my mouse with previous button
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> i still have this at home, if you need programmable buttons
15:59 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/5197yBtWRnL._AC_SY450_.jpg
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> hum, seems like it just opens the raw string, without using the storage interface
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> yeah
16:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> for the log the same, but i dunno if ddnet's official servers depend on that
16:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i guess a call to GetBinaryPath would fix it
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ```
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks>     char aFullPath[IO_MAX_PATH_LENGTH];
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks>     pStorage->GetCompletePath(IStorage::TYPE_SAVE, pPath, aFullPath, sizeof(aFullPath));
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ```
16:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> that's what the client sqlite uses
16:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> damn function returning void, didn't see it
16:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> weird that one returns a c string, and the other one, void
16:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> how do i test format with clang-format?
16:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> never mind, was written in readme.md
16:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> well, i think i lack knowledge to this part of code, because it doesn't have a pointer or a function to get a handle on the storage interface 😦
16:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in neovim with clangd i press gd on a function and i go to definition :ez:
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> hum, there are some files that are RGB in data
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> `./data/editor/checker.png:                               PNG image data, 32 x 32, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ./data/editor/background.png:                            PNG image data, 256 x 256, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
16:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> ./other/dmgbackground.png:                               PNG image data, 1280 x 832, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced`
16:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> should we completely drop RGB support in skins?
16:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> No need, as @Not Keks said, without transparency the skins would all be squares 😄
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> so yes need 😄
16:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> (to drop RGB support in skins)
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://bethesda.net/en/article/2RXxG1y000NWupPalzLblG/sunsetting-the-bethesda-net-launcher-and-migrating-to-steam
16:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> good news
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> in general, if those tools (clang-format, clang-tidy) are hard to figure out for people, just ignore them. I can run them later.
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> When does ddnet gets bought by microsoft
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> never, makes no sense to buy an open source project that anyone can just fork
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I can sell them DDNet, and 1 day later start a new project DDNet2 with the same data and code 😄
16:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Lmao
16:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> confirmed no transparency is not the best idea:

16:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> maybe we can add them to dependencies
16:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> well, most people just want to build, not contribute
17:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> I wonder if deen has siblings he told about tw
17:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, but they are not interested 😄
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> same here
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they say "oh you are playing that balls game again"
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or smth like that
17:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they say "oh you are playing that game about  balls moving again"
17:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> what's the difference between `CImageInfo::FORMAT_ALPHA` and `CImageInfo::FORMAT_RGBA`?
17:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> file utility reports both as `8-bit color RGBA, non interlaced`
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Exactly my parents.
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EXPİVOY> @everyone
18:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <EXPİVOY> take it guys :)

19:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> nobos
19:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> If my brother would invent a game ten thousands of players are playing id 24/7 run it and tell anyone to respect my autoritaeh or i call my brother :justatest:
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> did you use a clean build dir?
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> yup
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> what is your clang version?`
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> clang --version
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> it works if i had -lpthread manually at the end of the command because LDFLAGS adds it at the start
20:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i used gcc
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats rly old bro
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ❯ clang --version
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> clang version 13.0.1
20:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rolling releases are def better for desktop imho
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> at least the most recent stable
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
20:52 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> ubuntu 22 releases in 2 months too
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Not Keks help
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Multiple texture units (disable for macOS)"
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats a good tooltip for this option
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> you dont need to tool tip those 3
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> they are gone with vulkan update
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> opengl too?
20:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> (from gui at least)
20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/945771202553724978/unknown.png
20:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> thats the new version
21:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> looks good
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3050 seems like some of these are still here, i got similar ones
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> yeah they are annoying to fix, and the compilers we use seem to output correct results
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> but if you want try to fix them 😄
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i got the same for vptr CCharacter into CEntity
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> yeah thats one example
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> the compiler will probs do 1 vptr for that and not change it during runtime
21:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i also got a lot of leaks coming from libX11....
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> mhh, i only get leaks from SDL i think xd
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> lot in numbers but mostly small stuff (16 bytes)
21:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Not Keks> as long it doesnt leak during runtime it also doesnt really matter
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Do you do that with your brother already?
21:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@ᶰ°Konͧsti)
21:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Looks like worms. No wait! It’s Kirby with guns!!!!
21:48 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@Ryozuki)
21:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think, i fixed it with just using dynamic_cast ^_^
22:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ᶰ°Konͧsti> did but nobody knows Kog admin kamillentee these days :pepe:
22:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ᶰ°Konͧsti\: I do and I respect your authoritae
22:16 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> ALL HAIL THE PINK RAT
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> >fixed it
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> >dynamic cast
22:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> :pepeW:
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> joke 😄
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> a lot of data seems unitialized
22:22 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> but there's not a default entity type 😦
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Aaa any status tw dev here? Is the server list broken? https://status.tw/server/list/
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> tell them on https://discord.gg/k6fHF6wR
22:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> you don‘t have discord i guess, i‘ll do it
22:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Chairn> CCharacter.m_KeepHooked is written but never read?
23:50 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Thanks babe \<3
