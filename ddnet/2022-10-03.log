02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> @Moderator ^
02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Ah ok
02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> did my mod ping went through?
02:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Skeith> Ya
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Ok cuz it got deleted
02:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> Ok cuz it got deleted, thought it didn't
02:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> ah yes, don't ping staff, let an idiot invest in bankruptcy
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> no ones gonna click that shit bro 💀
03:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :pepedead: you never know, until it happens
03:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> then its on them
03:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> besides it was bound to be deleted immediately, shouldnt there be a bot that detects this and removes it instantly?
06:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> as if ddnet uses bots for that purpose
06:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> there are at least 10 mods online for that purpose and you still choose not to ping any of them to do their "job"
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/xtsa1o/lkml_linus_torvalds_re_patch_v9_1227_rust_add/
08:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> interesting discussion
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Very expected growing pains, the requirements for kernel code and userspace code are indeed quite different
08:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with your usual linux tone kek
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> linus
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> god i need a coffee
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah 😄
08:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I woke up at 8 for a lecture. The guy mailed 10 minutes ago saying he has covid. Now I'm wondering if I should sleep another hour
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Is this like a fever dream? 😄
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 64 bit overrated
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found this on the dota sub
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/xto7ye/has_anyone_pointed_out_they_use_an_unsigned_16bit/
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> valve pls xD
08:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Has anyone pointed out they use an unsigned 16-bit integer for net worth, so it wraps around if it goes above 65,535? See screenshot Jugg has 73,746 but his total says 8,211, Valve should use an unsigned 32-bit integer so high earners can bask in all their glory
08:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Basically it’s likely they don’t change it because it doesn’t impact during the game and re-typing the db field for almost 7,000,000,000 historical games is a very low priority
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looks more like a wrong formatter? The actual total seems to be stored properly given the graph is correct
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ingame its 32bit
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but on t he database 16bit i guess
08:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk xD
08:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, so the graph data comes from ingame and the display on the right the db? Idk what screen this is nor do I play dota so idk
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 its the networth
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aka  the gold spent on items + what you have
08:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it usually shows how far ahead a hero is from others
08:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Btw took a look at the rust discussion in the mailing list and it is a tough tough one
08:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A compile time way to infer whether you are in an atomic region or not
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah someone mentions that on the rust reddit too
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/xtsa1o/comment/iqskjs9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
08:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Usually you use your in-brain compiler to the best of your abilities to see if you are currently in a locked region. I can't quite think of a similar construct in safe rust
08:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though I've seen safe abstractions over some insane things, people are way too smart 😄
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its funny that linus always sounds passiv aggressive
09:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no matter what he writes xD

12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Does anyone know if you can map a unix socket to a port on dockee
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Docker
12:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Instead of using a port on the host side
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> E.g socket on host - port on container
12:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> fokkonaut has tested it now, it seems to work 🙂
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Doubt, but you can map it as a volume
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> like 
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```yml
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> volumes:
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW>   - /path/to/unix.sock:/app/unix.sock:rw
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> ```
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> can you give more details of the setup?
13:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> i.e. what program exposes the port?
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Why would it matter?
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I just asked in the general sense
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Just thought a socket might be more efficient
13:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Even if the app uses a port
13:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe the application already has a way to export a unix socket
13:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the unix socket doesn't give you a source IP address, that's a difference that would need to be covered
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Isn't an unix socket just a file? I mean visible when you do ls
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> For my usecase I do use volumes for that tho, that's how you do too if you need to map the docker sock
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, it's visible when you ls
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> Then yeah like I said
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1026463436848250991/RDT_20221003_1359051352162057071620855.jpg
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 kek
14:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Can’t believe I agree with julius
14:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when do you share your installed packages + config, so i can enjoy the best experience out of box
14:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> One day
16:05 <+ChillerDragon> any weechat pros here? I reached 87 buffers and thus need a way to search for them otherwise i spend all day scrolling :c any ideas?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a goto plugin
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> u use weechat? o.O
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://weechat.org/scripts/source/go.py.html/
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> thanks a lot pro
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, migrated from irssi some time ago
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe even a decade ago at this point
16:11 <+ChillerDragon> how does it work does it have keybindings?
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> okay seems like there is only /go
16:12 <+ChillerDragon> and sadly it does not really find my matrix dms
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can bind it
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> how o.O?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> \/help go I think would show you how
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> ye /key bind meta-g /go
16:13 <+ChillerDragon> but why it no find my matrix stuff :c
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Also maybe enable fuzzy searching in settings
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> in go settings or in weechat settings?
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They are all in the same place 😄
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1664806427.png
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> thats why it cant find my matrix buffers
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> cuz those names are cursed wtf
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> probably the matrix plugin to blame
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, that it can’t really help with
16:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How do you even find them in the sidebar?
16:16 <+ChillerDragon> there they look fine
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/poljar/weechat-matrix/issues/36
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> the issue seems closed tho
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i need to update
16:17 <+ChillerDragon> but i didnt use matrix in 2019 alr so hm
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Try enable the short_name setting in go settings
16:23 <+ChillerDragon> i will never understand weechat settings :D
16:23 <+ChillerDragon> i even booted into the tty thingy so gnome wont eat my alt+space key presses and it didnt help xd
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It doesn’t tolerate misconfigured terminals at all 😛
16:25 <+ChillerDragon> ah nice now all works except the keybinding
16:25 <+ChillerDragon> ur such a pro learath
16:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I’m just a vast source of knowledge of questionable use
16:26 <+ChillerDragon> ye i ended up doing what i always do so i do /set to go into the ui and then search the setting name to then close the scary ui buffer and type out the setting command manually :D
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> any idea what the issue is with this command? /key bind ctrl-k /go
16:27 <+ChillerDragon> ah got it
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> its ctrl-K not ctrl-k
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> wow help page said meta-g tho
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> such trol
16:28 <+ChillerDragon> okay this is epic now! like a proper chat app. No idea how i managed so long without it
16:30 <+ChillerDragon> shit weechat just became one of my most configured non backupped program
16:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> make video and convince me
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> of wat? is this some discord reply?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no i mean u
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> convice u of wat
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that its epic now like a proper chat app
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> ah oke
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> sure
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <0x526f6d656f> yo chillerdragon, do you have any idea what happened to darkdragon
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> he quit playing years ago
16:55 <+ChillerDragon> started studying computer science
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/OpenTube/video.php?t=weechat_search.mp4&u=chiller
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ✪ i mean the ctrl+k binding works exactly like in slack for example
16:56 <+ChillerDragon> its epic
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh yeah not convinced but i guess for a terminal only app quite cool xD
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> wtf
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> why not!?
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> what do you miss
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno, feels less usuable than smth like discord or matrix
16:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but maybe i am just nobo
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> its way more usable that element
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> for sure
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> only problem is that my matrix dms are readonly :c
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> i really need to fix that
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-wasm
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> postgres on the browser
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> A step towards a full ddnet server run on the browser kek
17:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie Senpai> Oh that's fine, sadly I couldn't test it out, I'm really sorry for that. I only have my phone since weeks. Maybe I can check it out in one or two days.
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> can the ddnet bot analyse chat messages and auto respond on them, similar to the #bot-cmds just not for cmds?
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not sure if the ddnet bot is still being developed
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It can do anything you code it to do
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i can only code javascript, not python
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Python is just fancy english, you’ll do great
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> python is the only thing i imagine more horrible than the hell
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> The simplest language to use. If you know any other language, python will come easy.
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i used it for blender plugins
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and i died
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Rip to you
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ty, but at least im in heaven bcs i stopped python 😉

19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> not check for "client" "start" "crash" or "visual" "glitches" "invisible text" "tiles are broken" and send the appropriate wiki entry ;D
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xD
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and see if it works out well enough
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> nice
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> now check for "client" "start" "crash" or "visual" "glitches" "invisible text" "tiles are broken" and send the appropriate wiki entry ;D
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> use discord.py==1.7.3
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> and don't forget this in discord developer page

19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> just create a json file and loop them
19:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nora> simple idea but should work
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Since u use python u gotta be hipster all the way and use machine learning to determine when and what to answer
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
19:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> good idea, let me use stable diffusion to gernerate an image of a link to the wiki

19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> prompt?
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> an URL to the wiki of ddracenetwork that handles graphics problems
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> afaik never gonna give you up is generated when the separate network detects nudity
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I wonder how that prompt generated nudity 😄
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i have it quite often actually
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but good to know that this is the reason 😄
19:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> always thought its somehow related to how good the result is, e.g. if the network was confident
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but ddnet wiki is porn, so not surprising after all
19:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :justatest:
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh man that graphical problem must be so hoy
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> oh man that graphical problem must be so hot
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <pilonpl> Probably the porn detector isn't quite great
21:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Headshot> oh no rickrolled by AI
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> git gud
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> ah more like this one
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> > git gud
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 🐍Hello im a python and im soo cool, bcs snakes are cool. Harry Potter can talk to snakes, it must be cool.
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 10 points for Slytherin
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i think we lost @Not Keks
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> RIP Vulkan guy
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah vulkan isnt perfect enough. need to start writing drivers
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> bitten by a Python, he died shortly after loosing his mind, probably due to the poison
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> rust or c driver?
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh, if im clever i'd use rust bcs of the future. but with c i probably have an easier time bcs i can litteraly copy paste stuff and have working interfaces and so on
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i guess assembly
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> `div %eax, %edx` --> SIGFPE
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Chairn what syntax is better
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i personally find % ugly af
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> i prefer the intel one too
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> AT&T is an aberration
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> true xd
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> intel is more verbose, but less error prone imo
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> my objdump is aliased to `objdump -M intel` 😄
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Александр Язов> Hi, can someone help me with setting up the server config so that the server is for 256 people
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> this is not possible
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Chairn> 64 players max
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Александр Язов> But I saw servers for 128 people, and I thought that it was possible to make a server for 256 people
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> Why would you need 256 people anyways?
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Александр Язов> I want to see what happens
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Александр Язов> If possible, how powerful is the server needed?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the problem is not the hardware, it's the software
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the ddnet server can only support 64 players
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Some of our servers have high CPU usage on a single thread with 64 players though, so increasing it might not work everywhere
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Александр Язов> I'm telling that I saw a server for 128 people
23:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Александр Язов> I have an outdated but still very powerful server
23:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Александр Язов> On two xeon e5-2680v4 CPUs with 128gb ram
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that's easy enough
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but our server is single-threaded anyway
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yeah, that's easily enough
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> There are other modifications that allow 128 players, but DDNet does not
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> changing to a efficient multithreaded mode would probs require slight physics changes
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> making the gameworld parallel is probs the way to go
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> first thing would probably be to change from an O(n²) algorithm for collision (and various other things) to something better
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh i guess
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i rly havent checked that stuff xD
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remember there was a bubble sort or smth
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> funny
