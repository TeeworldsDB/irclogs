05:46 < bridge> <BloodDrippn> yo i haven't played in a while and was wondering if anyone knew why my mouse gets stuck at top left of ddnet when i start it up. and i cant move it at all ( on latest version for linux )
05:47 < bridge> <BloodDrippn> if you could pm me if you know because im not very active, reason being I'm at work most of the time
07:28 < bridge> <fokkonaut> left click once to grab focus
07:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Have you tried switching from x11 to wayland or vice versa?

09:05 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> During the week #off-topic is usually more active. I guess that is explained by the same reason 😂
09:06 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :kek:
09:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> Good morning
10:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> another beautiful day to code in rust
11:25 < bridge> <Learath2> Every morning is a blessing from god and is excellent in it's own way
11:27 < bridge> <Ryozuki> @Learath2 zeus will zap u
11:27 < bridge> <Learath2> He can't. That'd be a bad vibe, but they have been banned
14:19 < bridge> <Ewan> :f3:
15:12 < bridge> <TsFreddie> <a:Catxplosion:1082715870893195274> have you considered a boyfriend
15:57 < bridge> <Learath2> Yes, but I don't seem to have the system update required
15:58 < bridge> <TsFreddie> :poggers2:
15:59 < bridge> <Learath2> They only gave me a cis module at birth it seems
16:01 < bridge> <TsFreddie> are you implying cis male can not have a boyfriend

19:47 < bridge> <Chairn> dafuck?
19:47 < bridge> <Chairn> didn't know it was possible to do that yourself
19:49 < bridge> <Learath2> Well it is physically possible. I never thought someone would be motivated enough and have the skills to do it
19:53 < bridge> <Chairn> that guy has 10k$+ equipment though
19:53 < bridge> <Chairn> that guy has 10k$+ pieces equipment though
19:56 < bridge> <deen> He also has a cool startup now with Jim Keller: Atomic Semi
20:10 < ChillerDragon> are official ddnet integration tests also wonkey or is it just me? I just got a ``[-] Error: expected 1 rank got 3`` that seems weird
20:14 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ur wonky
20:16 < ChillerDragon> at least on github it passes :shrug:
20:23 < bridge> <Learath2> It is a lot, but it's also a lot less than what one might expect. This is an extremely expensive manufacturing process

20:30 < bridge> <Chairn> red is cost for each node
20:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if i get my 10 fps more i'd pay lot more
20:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> the market of also grew a lot 😄
20:36 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> so its probably rather cheap
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> more stats like these from 2023
22:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> where is it so outdated XD
22:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> ` SELECT COUNT(*) as count, date(timezone('UTC', purchase_time)) as day from purchase GROUP BY date(timezone('UTC', purchase_time)) ORDER BY day DESC LIMIT 15;`
22:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> any sql masters
22:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> how can i make this faster
22:10 < bridge> <Ryozuki> i wanna count purchases by day
22:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> `create index if not exists idx_purchase_purchase_time on purchase( date(timezone('UTC', purchase_time)) );`
22:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it has this index
22:11 < bridge> <Ryozuki> it has no primary key though

22:34 < bridge> <Огурец> where to find the file game.cpp in the source of ddrace
22:39 < bridge> <Огурец> where to find the file game.cpp in the source of ddrace?
22:39 < bridge> <deen> He claims you can do 5nm for 500k 😉 https://twitter.com/szeloof/status/1549937044067172352
22:42 < bridge> <Огурец> .
22:46 < bridge> <Огурец> I am told that it is in scr/game, but there is only a similar gamecore file there, is that it?
22:48 < bridge> <𝐊𝐑𝐀𝐋> Hello, I'm thinking of creating a server for my game, how do you think I should do it?
22:55 < bridge> <Chairn> https://twitter.com/szeloof/status/1550111033582395392 well, i highly doubt that too
22:56 < bridge> <Chairn> yield is probably really shitty, like 90%+ defect
22:57 < bridge> <Chairn> not sure those machines linked can be used for 5nm
22:57 < bridge> <Chairn> electron microscope is useless too
22:59 < bridge> <Огурец> .
23:01 < bridge> <deen> what is your game? Is it based on DDNet/Teeworlds or an independent game?
23:02 < bridge> <deen> do you just want to run the server or write the source code for it?
23:02 < bridge> <deen> There is no game.cpp, what are you looking for?
23:03 < bridge> <Огурец> where to get it then? I search in the source archive from github ddrace
23:05 < bridge> <𝐊𝐑𝐀𝐋> an indie game
23:05 < bridge> <Learath2> There is no game.cpp in ddnet or teeworlds
23:05 < bridge> <Огурец> maybe it was renamed by the developers?
23:06 < bridge> <Огурец> what is it called then. similar code
23:06 < bridge> <Learath2> What code are you looking for?
23:06 < bridge> <𝐊𝐑𝐀𝐋> I want the server to record user information, such as level, etc.
23:07 < bridge> <Огурец> initial, where all the functionality is written
23:09 < bridge> <Learath2> huh? the functionality is spread amongst all the source files
23:09 < bridge> <Learath2> if you are looking for a specific functionality I can try to help you track it down, but there isn't one file with the entire game in it 😛
23:12 < bridge> <Огурец> Well, for example, I want to make arrows that will be public on a nearby player. In what file should I write it?
23:13 < bridge> <Learath2> Public arrows? I'm afraid I don't follow
23:15 < bridge> <Огурец> I didn't understand you, I'll use a translator 🙂
23:16 < bridge> <𝐊𝐑𝐀𝐋> I can explain in more detail @deen 🙂
23:18 < bridge> <Огурец> for example, I want to make a line go from my player to another, where to write it?
23:29 < bridge> <Learath2> That would probably belong in `src/game/client/components/` inside a new file, like how we added `freezebars.cpp`
23:32 < bridge> <Chairn> hmm, the actual quote is "there is no spoon"
23:32 < bridge> <Chairn> there is no cow level
