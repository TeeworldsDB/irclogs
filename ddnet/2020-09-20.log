00:46 <+ChillerDragon> @deen am i trippin on stoopid again or did you ping me on a random pr with a random comment? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2864#issuecomment-695360872
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: I added your autumn map from vanilla 0.7 in that PR
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oh wait, wrong pr
00:48 <+ChillerDragon> oh ok then it makes half sense
00:48 <+ChillerDragon> and yea its intentional its a flickering lamp i thought it adds cool vibes
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok
00:48 <+ChillerDragon> am i famous now?
00:49 <+ChillerDragon> seems like i missed some things while paying elss attention on 0.6 projects
00:50 <+ChillerDragon> oof rude i can not respond on github @deen
00:51 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1600555829.png
00:53 <+ChillerDragon> the clouds sound like a actual issue tho i did not touch the clouds tho so its weird since that issue was never spotted in the heavens theme
00:55 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar do we have 0.7 map support already? :)
00:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I just loaded the map in ddnet editor and saved and it worked
00:56 <+ChillerDragon> oh
00:56 <+ChillerDragon> but actual 0.7 decrompression would actually be really useful
00:56 <+ChillerDragon> i tried once but rage quitted https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/2540
00:57 <+ChillerDragon> oh and @deen do u mind answering ur self or deleting ur comment or giving me write permission so that i dont look like a jerk who ghosts OG deen
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> not sure what you mean
00:57 <+ChillerDragon> i sent a screen
00:57 <+ChillerDragon> im not allowed to post in the pr u pinged me
00:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> why don't you have permissions?
00:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i thought everyone can writecomments
00:58 <+ChillerDragon> so did i
00:58 <+ChillerDragon> maybe a draft thing
00:58 <+ChillerDragon> or personal
00:58 <+ChillerDragon> known 0.6 haters might be banned from discussion
01:01 <+ChillerDragon> thanls :)
01:04 <+ChillerDragon> fstd: since you leaked u do not have a bouncer and irc is always running when ur machine is online one might actually start collecting some interesting metadata on u :p
01:04 <+fstd> ChillerDragon: you should start your metadata collection with a /ctcp version and try to draw a first conclusion :P
01:05 <+ChillerDragon> whats that o.O
01:05 <+ChillerDragon> client to client protocol?
01:05 <+fstd> do you even IRC?
01:05 <+ChillerDragon> oof
01:06 <+ChillerDragon> im more a discord refugeee than an irc native
01:07 <+fstd> well, with CTCP you can obtain a bit of information on other users, if they allow it anyway
01:07 <+fstd> 01:05:14 [QuakeNet] CTCP VERSION reply from ChillerDragon: WeeChat 1.6 (Sep 27 2017)
01:07 <+ChillerDragon> dox
01:07 <+fstd> (nice outdated client btw)
01:07 <+fstd> hax
01:08 <+fstd> anyway if you /ctcp version'ed me you'd find i'm running NetBSD on ARM
01:08 <+fstd> and the conclusion would be that the client is probably not running on my main computer
01:09 <@deen> shs li
01:09 <+ChillerDragon> CTCP reply from fstd: VERSION irssi v1.2.2 - running on NetBSD evbarm
01:09 <+ChillerDragon> dfq is "shs li"
01:09 <@deen> wrong window :D
01:09 <+ChillerDragon> leak

01:10 <+fstd> yo momma does
01:10 <+ChillerDragon> discord is worse tho
01:10 <+ChillerDragon> :fire: fstd

01:11 <+ChillerDragon> i also use them in tw chat
01:11 <+ChillerDragon> thats the only thing discord did right
01:11 <@heinrich5991> @–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π it's not unicode, I checked in IRC
01:11 <@heinrich5991> he wrote `:fire:`
01:11 <+ChillerDragon> hehe
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> `üî•`
01:12 <@heinrich5991> wtf, the bridge messes that up both ways
01:12 <+ChillerDragon> but sadly :justatest: does not work i was told
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> Rofl
01:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> :trademark:

01:13 <+ChillerDragon> i actually do not see any diff between ur and my fire in my discord client lol

01:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> Font issue?
01:14 <+ChillerDragon> likley
01:14 <+ChillerDragon> think my dont does not have a single emote
01:14 <+ChillerDragon> such sentence
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hmmmm
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> What a nice font
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon secretly on discord
01:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> Hate emojis
01:16 <+ChillerDragon> well just for bridge testing :justatest:
01:16 <+fstd> there are hate emojis?
01:16 <+ChillerDragon> :angry:
01:16 <+fstd> technology has gone too far
01:16  * fstd goes back to 7bit ascii
01:16  * ChillerDragon giggles
01:17  * fstd wonders how bridge treats messages like this
01:17  * ChillerDragon knows they wont arrive
01:17 <@heinrich5991> hate emojis?
01:17  * fstd so this way we can have a private IRC chat without all those stupid discord morons?
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how do i disable escape exiting me out of editor
01:17  * ChillerDragon discord has emojy reactions and we have /me
01:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> its the only one thats annoying
01:18  * ChillerDragon so next time u dox me could do it here :p
01:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> Use vim
01:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :q
01:23 <+fstd> use emacs
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> Don't use Macs
01:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> 3d max
01:27 <+ChillerDragon> try alt + f4
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen u still on?
01:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think the chance that something is wrong with skin is really high
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Agreed, I'll release a new version with skin downloader turned off?
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You think that's enough?
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh i dunno, told few ppl to quickly do cl_download_skins 0 now, if they have bad fps
01:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but dunno if its already too late then
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> does curl try to download often, if the database is down?
01:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or not reachable
01:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> i don't think so
02:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> :justatest:
03:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> Revert revert revert
03:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> revert all 11k ddnet commits
03:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> some day, when some ultra intelligent robots analyze the human race, they'll just think, why do humans do so many mistakes
03:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and when they hear of "love" they explode.. too much computing required to understand
03:48 <+ChillerDragon> love how you relate love to reverting commits
03:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @heinrich5991 dunno if u wrote the bridge, but it broke some day even harder
03:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/755427759919988851
04:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Soreu is there smth like a "commonly used abbreviations" for tw on the ddnet wiki
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> > is cl_mouse_max_distance relative to the screen width?
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> @[freenode] b3z#0000 back to this.
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> 
07:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Fin> Is it actually? Because mouse distance is quite weirde on widescreens?!
08:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757131668556480542/Screen_Shot_2020-09-20_at_1.50.35_AM.png
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> anyone know why there are so many players on the china server with names like this
08:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is it some kindof new default name system
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its not a flooding thing since ive seen alot of them actually playing
08:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ( @Learath2 @TsFreddie üåà )
09:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> Its their population number
09:17 <+ChillerDragon> @Jupstar thats the bridge https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge
09:18 <+ChillerDragon> oh wait or are we talking about tw bridge? xd
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> @louis idk, about wiki you'd have to ask @Ryozuki I guess
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I have been on it once only to see how entities explain is ported
10:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no i dont run the current wiki
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ask patiga or zwelf
10:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> oh
10:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen you sure we want to remove the discord link? It's like the only hub we have. We could moderate it more strictly if you want
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Nah, it was a spontaneous idea yesterday. In the end it's not just my decision
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well there is a bit of an undermoderation issue in the discord, so I kinda understand
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @onby QQ ids probably. It's an ICQ clone that is still popular in China
10:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ohh makes sense ty
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Have you experienced crashes on 60 players on ddnet?
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> In SixUp proto on cache clear
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It's not affecting me now as my mod is not that popular, but I think that would be interesting for you at least
10:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> @Learath2
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I've tried bots to make a load test today and it crashed immediately on 60th bot connect.
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Though I haven't tried it with vanilla ddnet code yet.
10:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Though I haven't tried it with vanilla ddnet code yet but I haven't changed anything in Sixup protocol.
10:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Not requesting any help with it atm, just curious if you have experienced something similar.
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ddnet has constantly servers with 63 ppl
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe its related to the bot
10:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Maybe. I can test it with vanilla ddnet.
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> And bot is chillerbot's pentest headless ddnet client.
10:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So it doesn't do anything unusual.
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Cannot reproduce it on vanilla ddnet.
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> It seems that it's somehow related to that ddnet doesn't uses rounds/matches.
10:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> but I am not sure
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> ok, thanks
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is memory getting corrupted elsewhere and not causing the crash until then
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Maybe. But it's clear that I don't yet have expertise to investigate that.
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> I will when it will be a problem in my mod.
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Also it doesn't seems to be a problem for a DDRace too.
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> In my mod a round is restarted after first 10 seconds (warmup end). DDRace don't have warmups or round ends.
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> So it's not a problem for it.
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ic
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> Anyway I *HOPE* it will be my problem... I mean dealing with 60+ players
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the github cli makes testing pull requests ez
12:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> `gh pr checkout 2880`
12:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You can do that without the github cli thing btw
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i know
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its more bothersome
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ref pull blabla
12:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i can also review from the terminal
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have `fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/ddnet/pr/*` in my config
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> so it's just a `git checkout ddnet/pr/2880`
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
12:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> does it take lot of space
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Not that much more given ddnet/teeworlds are absolutely massive repositories üòÑ
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can always clone from a certain point
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and it wont take that much space
12:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git clone --shallow-exclude=included-libs https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u know a way to make submodules automatically update
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> when syncing
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I shallow clone when I'm building it on a server or sth
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i always do the following 
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```bash
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git fetch upstream
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git merge upstream/master
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> git submodule update
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ```
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nope, I usually do `git fetch ddnet; git reset --hard ddnet/master; git submodule update`

12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> super modern commands
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What does EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS do?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> compile_commands.json
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> generates this
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> which u symlink to base dir
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it allows vim to autocomplete
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, helps coc
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 coc and any other c++ language server
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> youcompleteme etc
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> clangd
12:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> coc uses clangd
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I had a very heated discussion about IDEs a couple days ago
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im waiting so much for neovim 0.5
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it adds native support for LSP
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's really odd how far people can go trying to defend these proprietary, slow behemoths
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and tree sitter
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> LSP is so nice to have
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited.
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is rly important
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most awaited feature of neovim
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> @Learath2 merge my pr :rooEZSip:
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 cuz rn most of the time u gotta save to update the syntax higlighter, specially if it highights with info from the LSP
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aka semantic highlighting

12:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> its just a test
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> there is no ready to use method to find the last word in the string if words separated by whitespaces ?
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> str_next_token
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the way to do it probs
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> str_in_list
12:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> I dont see how str_in_list can help here
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> not sure about str_next_token, feels like it is better to write method I need from the scratch
12:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> not sure about str_next_token, feels like it is better to write method I need from the scratch, i.e. some overhead while I still have to write some code around
12:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <BannZay> not sure about str_next_token, feels like it is better to write method I need from the scratch, i.e. some overhead while I still have to write some code around this method
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The last word would just be `strrchr(pLine, ' ')`
13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im glad i documented the split functions

13:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> otherwise i would have spent 10 more mins doing this shit

13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nicely done
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do you also have auto width?
13:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still have to figure out how to actually use the scroll value
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you not use a scroll region?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the width for autorule names is 120
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since ever
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 do u have an example usage in code
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah do we even have scroll regions in 0.6?
13:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me check
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont think so
13:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, we don't
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Maybe we should take that. `CScrollRegion` is veeery easy to use
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> much cleaner than the manual scrolling we do
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> scroll code is a pain
13:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> Why almost every of my team message is doubled if my dummy is also in the team? ._.

13:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> and it's only if I write team message when in /pause
13:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yay i did it
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats a known bug
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> I was quite sure it was fixed already
13:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> same as that weird random "(unknown) do you know someone who uses a bot?"
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> > ( @Learath2 @TsFreddie üåà )
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @onby their QQ number
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ppl use that
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it is kinda stupid, but they do use that
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> new ddnet client is shutdowning for 5 seconds is so annoying
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye deen guessed it
13:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> wouldnt have thought
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Soreu do u have a image with rules that exceed 5
13:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> aka with a shitload of automapper rules
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> mind's mapres
13:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> send pls
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> wait, trying to find the files xd
13:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nvm ill just add myself more rules

14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Pure_luck did you run a server inside client? that's the only change i can imagine causing that.
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> what system are you on?
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why ping me. Not my fault Wayland or SDL is buggy xd
14:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah true
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i wonder whats the status about sdl and wayland
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> but you are the wizard

14:59 < SnowFox> Hello world. I just reported #2885 and will be on here if anyone wants to discuss here instead of on git. https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2885
14:59 <+SnowFox> GitHub*
15:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> You can report it to sdl
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont get a segfault
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> instead it tells me this
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> [2020-09-20 15:01:21][gfx]: unable to init SDL video: wayland not available
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> [2020-09-20 15:01:21][gfx]: out of ideas. failed to init graphics
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> [2020-09-20 15:01:21][client]: couldn't init graphics
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ah
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess i dont have wayland installed
15:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im dumb
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> actually i have it installed
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so idk
15:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 10 extra/wayland 1.18.0-2 (130.2 KiB 751.8 KiB) (Installed)
15:02 <+SnowFox> Ryozuki: It might need you to use wayland? Maybe try https://swaywm.org ?
15:03 <+SnowFox> It is basically a rewrite of i3 for wayland.
15:03 <+SnowFox> At least you get the error if not the segfault.
15:03 <+SnowFox> Note I got both
15:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im on i3gaps rn
15:04 <+SnowFox> Then sway should feel right at home :)
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how is wayland support for 144hz?
15:05 <+SnowFox> Maybe run DDNet in gdb first?
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i remember it being locked to 60
15:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was running it in gdb
15:05 <+SnowFox> No idea.
15:05 <+SnowFox> Hm
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> [ 09/20/2020 15:05:43.315 session_init FATAL ERROR ] Another composite manager is already running
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
15:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> > did you run a server inside client? that's the only change i can imagine causing that.
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> 
15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Pure_luck> what do you mean?
15:07 <+SnowFox> You may want to be careful with running sway if you don't have systemd or don't SUID it or have $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR set (as needed) but point to a non-existant directory. Fail these and it may lock up. ;)
15:07 <+SnowFox> I don't use systemd so had to SUID sway.
15:08 <+SnowFox> If you have systemd, then it should be fine.
15:09 <+SnowFox> Totally unrelated. THANK YOU FOR ADDING AUSTRALIAN SERVERS. <3
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye i use systemd
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the mouse controls look cool
15:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but im rly lazy to change
15:12 <+SnowFox> lazy to change to test or to perma switch?
15:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> test and switch i guess
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i would need to configure lot of stuff
15:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also does polybar work with it out of the box?
15:13 <+SnowFox> At least to test you'd only need to start sway from the tty
15:13 <+SnowFox> I don't use polybar
15:13 <+SnowFox> I haven't used i3 but my understanding is that sway will adopt your i3 config directly.
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> i dont know why, but laser cant be rendered
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> only if the dot where it ends or bounces in necessary distance
15:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @snowfox, you can try valgrind and see if smth inside our code breaks, else its probs related to wayland or sdl
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh and @snowfox, u can edit the ddnet_settings,cfg config and add
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> gfx_opengl_major 2
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> gfx_opengl_minor 1
15:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that defaults to the SDLs default
15:33 <+SnowFox> Jupstar: The configs changes didn't fix it, downloading+building valgrind now.
15:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> are u on gentoo?
15:34 <+SnowFox> Similar; https://exherbo.org
15:36 <+SnowFox> Jupstar: http://ix.io/2ycH
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> cant access http sites xd
15:37 <+SnowFox> Eh?
15:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have strict https rule
15:38 <+SnowFox> Easy to make an exemption
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i prefer not to
15:38 <+SnowFox> Fair. Curious, Tor Browser?
15:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nope
15:38 <+SnowFox> You can curl it, just a raw paste.
15:38 <+SnowFox> Otherwise I can gist it
15:39 <+SnowFox> https://gist.github.com/WildCryptoFox/95310956c72473890823e409b1da32e4
15:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ty
15:41 <+SnowFox> BTW: I first read the "cant access http sites xd" as if I copied ddnet failing to reach the map download servers because my network settings block all network by default. I use groups to route my traffic over tor or clear and forbid LAN access. Had to double check my log before you elaborated. :P
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> only interesting could be the conditional jump
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the rest looks like deep inside SDL
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wow thats alot of work, generally cool, but tor is too slow for me xd
15:43 <+SnowFox> Can stream 1080p videos from YouTube. If I use aria2c it averages at 1MiB but can do over 10MiB/s. Latency really isn't that bad, especially these days.
15:44 <+SnowFox> And not a lot of work at all. A small shell script to generate the iptables rules.
15:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well u can try starting valgrind with
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™>  --trace-children=yes --track-origins=yes
15:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> to get the line number of the conditional jump (i hope that these were the commands :D)
15:46 <+SnowFox> refresh for the update
15:46 <+SnowFox> or diff. https://gist.github.com/WildCryptoFox/95310956c72473890823e409b1da32e4/revisions
15:46 <+SnowFox> Very unhelpful diff with pids on every line :P
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> strange that it doesnt display the line numbers xd
15:48 <+SnowFox> heh, whoops
15:49 <+SnowFox> reload for debug build
15:49 <+SnowFox> Not sure that changed anything
15:50 <+SnowFox> yes it did
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> are u at the first commit after the fail?
15:50 <+SnowFox> yes
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or current source
15:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
15:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well i think i'd have catched any conditional jump with the current source, so very likely a wayland bug :/ strange that GL 2.1 didnt fix it
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah wait
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> libwayland uses EGL?
15:52 <+SnowFox> I believe so
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> that explains alot xD
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well you can try setting major to 1 for now, the opengl shaders aren't ready for EGL yet
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> also GLEW isnt supported in EGL i think
15:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> there is actually alot of issues with EGL
15:54 <+SnowFox> [2020-09-20 13:53:57][sdl]: SDL version 2.0.12 (compiled = 2.0.12)
15:54 <+SnowFox> [2020-09-20 13:53:57][gfx]: Created OpenGL 1.1 context.
15:54 <+SnowFox> [2020-09-20 13:53:57][gfx]: out of ideas. failed to init graphics
15:54 <+SnowFox> [2020-09-20 13:53:57][client]: couldn't init graphics
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah maybe bcs it still tries to call opengl functions in glew
15:54 <+SnowFox> still segfaults
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i think that won't work, does wayland provide a opengl backend=
15:55 <+SnowFox> No idea
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sadly EGL is also stricter with NPOT textures and stuff like that, so its not an easy change, best bet would be to force the OpenGL context somehow, or write a small patch for EGL
15:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why is wayland a thing even?
15:59 <+SnowFox> Learath2: Many great reasons including security, performance, and simplicity.
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess it is more secure if nothing works with it, it is more performant if you can't run anything and it is indeed simpler if you are not compatible with anything
16:00 <+SnowFox> I've had many more issues with X than wayland...
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Why does Wayland use EGL?
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> EGL is the only GL binding API that lets us avoid dependencies on existing window systems, in particular X. GLX obviously pulls in X dependencies and only lets us set up GL on X drawables. The alternative is to write a Wayland specific GL binding API, say, WaylandGL.
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ```
16:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Isn't there a glew shim somewhere that makes wayland compatible?
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i can understand their point, but EGL wasnt built for embedded systems for a reason xD
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> most stuff is compatible tho, its really just the initialization that needs a fix
16:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and maybe default to opengl es 3.0
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah, freedesktop.org, not surprised they are the ones peddling this
16:03 <+SnowFox> On the prior version btw; 
16:04 <+SnowFox> [2020-09-20 14:03:42][sdl]: SDL version 2.0.12 (compiled = 2.0.12)
16:04 <+SnowFox> [2020-09-20 14:03:42][gfx]: Created OpenGL 3.0 context.
16:04 <+SnowFox> 4.0 works too
16:04 <+SnowFox> It is something in this commit
16:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Did you find the exact commit that breaks it?
16:05 <+SnowFox> Yes, that was https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/a07e9ac2cf5f4a1856a58749caf9f5afc85022d2
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah probs bcs before that i didnt call glew
16:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> glew is an arugment against opengl
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> EGL garantuees u that the function exists.. opengl requires loading them
16:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> (atleast on most systems)
16:11 <+SnowFox> So.. a simple fix?
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well not really easy, but u can try removing the glew code and default to opengl 1
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd need to add EGL support at compile time already
16:13 <+SnowFox> I don't know what to change there and should really just be sleeping. Is there anything you'd like me to check before I call the night? If you can give me instructions to try in the morning, I'll try them.
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just post it on the github issue, gn
16:14 <+SnowFox> Okay, thanks Jupstar!
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do I port the huffman code to C or do I write a C interface for the huffman class?
17:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki should probably render repeated a different way
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I thought it was the client id looking at your screenshot
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont have time rn so throw ur best ideas there
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i gtg outside
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> to the real world
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> there is something outside?
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just meeting some friends
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> something like this on the left maybe?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757262296002330664/unknown.png
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> friends?
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye i wanted it on the left
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but the rendering made me kys
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kym
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> *
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, rendering anything there is cancer, I learned there in the heart PR
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> you mean kms
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah that
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> ~~hey, stolen pic~~
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> :justatest:
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Pls don't report me to the authorities
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> vanilla did it by passing a textcursor, and just render in the cursor so the player name naturally follows
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> although, I nuked that code in my rework since textcursor doesn't work like that anymore :doggo_lol:
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> noooo, I was sooo close
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The huffman decompression broke when I copied it over üò¶
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you have the initialization?
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah, I think I added an extra & somewhere
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll look it over again
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> how do you save to another server again=
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> how do you save to another server again?
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> in libtw2, I used the official files and gave them a C API
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sec
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @NeXus you don't need to anymore, all saves can be loaded everywhere
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 I was thinking of doing that, then I thought I'd be clever and steal it from 0.5
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 0.5 is C++, no?
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/tree/master/huffman/reference/sys/src
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> for reference, if you need it
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 0.5 still has it's engine in C, oddly
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huh?
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> interesting
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 how does huffman::decompress handle the bolted on token at the end?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> is the token compressed along with everything?
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, and it's madness
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> üòÑ
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We really should redesign this mess
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk who keeps coming up with these
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> token should just have been added to the header ^^
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, it was either you or east who added the ddnet token protocol
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> not me
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Where would you add the token in the header? we have like 2 bits + 3 bytes lying around, that's about it
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd make the header larger
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we need to know whether the token is there either way
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wouldn't that break vanilla compat?
17:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> also with this position
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we can't send the token to vanilla servers/clients this way either
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @mind old vs new
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757269676815417404/Screenshot_20200920_175749.png
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757269679319416932/Screenshot_20200920_175846.png
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so we already know whom to send these to
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh, TKEN is already broken for vanilla
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so only use this header for ddnet clients/servers (like we do now with the weird position)
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now I'm curious who came up with it, git blame time
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> eeeee üòÑ
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean it worked, and that was better than all other proposals üòâ
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wonder why he did it this way though
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I guess easier to implement?
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> originally we sent the token to all clients
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that was broken
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so easier to implement I guess
18:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @Jupstar ‚ú™ is dilate even needed with the new renderer?
18:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think it's still needed, given it's a blending issue dilate fixes and we didn't change the blending
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> 0.7 doesn't need it
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Sure?
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Cuz 0.7 uses 3d textures
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> What's with the very odd shape for the circles btw? A circle seen from an angle should be a perfect ellipse
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Or smth like that
18:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I wouldn't know if 3d textures blend alpha differently
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Jupstar knows i guess
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> 0.7 renderer is better in several ways
18:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Ah I guess someone did say 0.7 uses premultiplied alpha, so the effect would be muuuuuch much less noticable
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ravie is it? I thought we caught up most of the way with the latest renderer
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We just used texture arrays instead of the 3d texture hack 0.7 went with
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 0.7 uses pre calculated alphas
18:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we already had this discussion xD
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oreo explained in great detail what it is xD
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> And I remembered said discussion and already stated this fact when I remembered said discussion
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I was messing around with some seamless textures recently and noticed the ddnet renderer makes little cuts between tiles, while 0.7 doesn't
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I even pointed out the fact that my rememberence was oddly sudden, with an "Ah"
18:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Thought it was pretty clear
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie 
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> "Ravieheute um 18:06 Uhr
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 0.7 renderer is better in several ways"
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tell me more
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Already did ^^
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well it looks better and doesn't need dilate, that's it
18:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it doesnt do mipmaps
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u just like crisp textures for some reason
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well who would like blurry textures?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> who likes wrongly displayed linear interpolated textures?
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> maybe 0.7 looks just a *little* too sharp but it looks the closest to what I see in inkscape
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> We need more switchable tiles for switch layer
18:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> So as unfreeze, teles, switches itself etc
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ can't we bias the lod choice a bit depending on the zoom level?
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> we could adapt pre calculated alpha values, but that requires modification of the texture on runtime
18:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so for 1024 * 1024 its aroujnd 4mb of image processing
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 we can do alot of things. in 3.3 i can do almost anything xd
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if the drivers would just work fine on this world
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't think we need to bother with premultiplying, dilate works just fine
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> @Jupstar ‚ú™ sorry for off-topic, but does ddnet render high detail skins? like 2048x1024?
18:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ah btw @Jupstar ‚ú™ I noticed when zooming, the new renderer has much worse performance and looks worse than your old algorithm :lol:
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ well within which context can't we bias? just broken 3.3 drivers? what happens if you try?
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @gerdoe probably yes, but might create artifacts
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> okey, will test
18:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie then u forgot to enable 3.3
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 i think it already works in 2.1, but only if the driver works well
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i remember someone wiith NVIDIA card had problems with broken mipmaps one day here
18:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and he had onen of the newest NVIDIA cards
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it was a broken modern driver
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i dont want to imagine old ones xD
18:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> nvidia just tries to cheat too much with mipmapping
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> oh it's actually fine with the blurry shader but terrible with the sharp one
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> but the old renderer did everything well xD
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its bcs gl 3.0 and lower dont support instanced rendering
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I have 3.3 enabled tho
18:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i could enable it with extension, and might also do it, but currently i am happy we dont have problems with the new renderer xd
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> did you have 3.3 enabled before the upgrade? I don't think 3.3 changed that much
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie strange, then ur pc is struggling or smth
18:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes it only changed a bit visually(but for FULL HD too much sadly, bcs less "sharp" textures)
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> all renderers(except 1.x) use 3d texture or texture arrays now
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> thats the whole magic
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i have in fact a bit more fps with the new renderer, probably bcs we have less opengl shader state changes now
18:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> bcs we dont calc mipmap our own and dont need to care about texture coordinates
18:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well the new renderer either looks blurry on default zoom or terribly pixellated when zooming if you "fix" it
18:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It should never look blurry on default zoom imho
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> no
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then smth is wrong in ur setting
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> zooming lookks SOOOO MUCH better now
18:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in 3.3
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6654924/90831553-4699fe80-e344-11ea-8ba1-979761712d95.png
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> open in new tab
18:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its so perfect even when zooming out far
18:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also looks blurry
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it has great detail, less loss like with linear interpolating
18:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok bad map to show this
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and yes its bit blurrier
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> apparently the bugged skins affected also me
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757276230272811089/unknown.png
18:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well the old 3.3 looked perfect both in default and zoom, performance was good too
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> #2452
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2452
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> after doing the shader fix to make it not blurry, zoom looks like this
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757276419457024091/screenshot_2020-09-20_18-17-24.png
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i know, bcs it doesnt calc any mipmap anymore
18:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so it will get to a point where it just samples the images zoomed
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> you have to change the param of textureLOD(..., 1)
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> to 1
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or higher
18:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie in your driver there must be an option like "Rendering perforamnce vs image quality"
18:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> anyway, if someone wants to implement the old mipmap calc, i have no problem with it, i just dont want todo it rn
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but default it to off
18:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Soreu u still have the broken client open?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie u had nvidia?
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> nah it's just an integrated
18:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in nvidia drivers u can apply a load bias
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe that works for intel too, or amd
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> yes @Jupstar ‚ú™
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> how can I help you with it
18:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> is it only for downloaded skins @Soreu ?
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> nope, I have had those two since long time
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> one of them is the one I'm currently usng
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ah @Ravie opengl has a function for that
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> PsychoGod & PsychoWolfe are "shown" on the screenshot
18:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'll just implement it, and u need to test if it works üòÑ
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Soreu ok, but the wolf is working everwhere else?
18:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> only in the selection not
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> yea
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> removed search string, and typed it back again, and no visual bugs anymore
18:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Soreu> .-.
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok, but doesnt sound like a huge bug
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> like
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> #2452
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ..
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> would really like to know if he had that problem again
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/2452
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Soreu wanna create an issue, maybe deen wants to fix it
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> tell him its rare bug when using the skin selection
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rem1x> hello, please back thing in new ddnet 15.0 leave from game ctrl+shift+q
18:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Rem1x> hello, please back thing in new ddnet 15.0 leave from the game ctrl+shift+q
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757285507574005770/screenshot_2020-09-20_18-59-31.png

19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the second one looks good
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yes
19:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can now do it as u want
19:26 <+ChillerDragon> does someone use or know what whatsapp business is? And why i got a code for that even tho i have no whatsapp installed?
19:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> someone uses your phone number for spamming ig
19:28 <+ChillerDragon> ah so i guess everyone can apply for that and enter any number hm
19:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> Should "run server" button (in the client) be working? For me it is saying server executable was not found, but I have `/usr/bin/DDNet-Server` installed.
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie u can then try the artifacts, when its built ^
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> gfx_opengl_texture_lod_bias -1000
19:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> would be one mipmap level higher
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and use the default shaders ravie, not the modified ones
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> looks good
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> with -1000 there was still some distortion at some zoom levels but setting it at -100 somehow made everything look perfect
20:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> strange, -1100 would have made more sense, but ok xd
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well no -100 probs makes sense
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the driver is only off a bit not alot
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Rem1x `bind ctrl+shift+q quit` in f1
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen i think we have quite some feature prs now, you mentioned about agreeing with making RC, when do u think the first one should come?
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Definitely not before they are merged üòÑ
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xD
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe in about a month, people are tired of having this many new versions
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im trying to test every pr that comes anyway
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well atleast the ones i can test
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the ddnet logo is 1024*293
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> XD
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> worst image dimensions ever
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> wtf
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lola> i cant even set that resolution
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberfighter> doesnt the logo get stretched in the menu
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <cyberfighter> :justatest:
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <abcqwerty> lol its not monitor resolution
22:21 <+SnowFox> Morning
22:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <a gerdoe> night
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @gerdoe did it work btw?
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ what's wrong with the dimensions?
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its not directly wrong, its just a strange number
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 293
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> just made the width round and assumed height doesn't matter
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> dimensions are the same as on website logo
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ will we get your rounded-edge-removal change btw? I liked the look
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen yes, but we need to consider a few things.. e.g. ingame items should still be a bit round, too much edges looks weird too
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> in menu is looks better tho
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Should we have a vote on that on Discord first?
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> before you spend too much effort and maybe others don't like it
23:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> People I'm a bit retarded or smth, help me find main server game cycle please
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> while(m_RunServer < STOPPING) in server.cpp?
23:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> OOf
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> thanks
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> I read this line like 3 times
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen yeah, i just make 2 screenshots, and u say something like, do you "generally" like too have less edges or smth
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> > People I'm a bit retarded or smth
23:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I noticed last night üòÑ
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @deen are the skins downloaded from a different database than the one we're cleaning up?
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> No, same
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Ravie but they might be cached by cloudflare, I can clear the cache
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> preferrably once when you're done with cleaning up
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> > I noticed last night üòÑ
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> @deen At nights I'm starting doing weird shit but don't go to sleep untill I get black outed
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> oh btw @deen before i forgot:
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/293493549758939136/757276232684667060
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> its only in the skin selection tho.. not ingame, nowhere else
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> there's no problem I was just curious why one skin that I deleted keeps getting downloaded in game
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> cloudflare has pretty agressive caching for graphics I think
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and I don't want to lower it since most skins won't change I guess
23:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> few weeks ago I literally send my dickpick to few random people on discord
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ ok, interesting that that still happens. Yesterday I also figured that the fix we found wouldn't fix this problem
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ did you guys find out what might be causing it?
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π yeah, don't do that in the future please or you're not welcome here
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen havent looked into it, did other stuff today üòÑ
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just made sure its just the selection
23:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> not anywhere else
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> Do you use cloudflare for CDN only?
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Soreu could you send me your settings_ddnet.cfg privately? Want to make sure it's not just caused by config
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, and works surprisingly well
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> How much payment they do require
23:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> nothing, it's for free
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –†—É–¥–æ–π> Free CDN, epic
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u quickly want to test the not round things @deen i have a branch hack_no_roundings
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I saw that branch, that's why I'm asking üôÇ
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @murpi thx for your map as background, looks really good üòÑ
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/757355907804954774/screenshot_2020-09-20_23-41-28.png
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Woah!
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> that looks so cool. Are the stars not too bright when there's text?
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but its also a map he uses ingame
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just made it a theme for testing
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and actually like it üòÑ
23:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> somtimes a planet flies by, really nice üòÑ
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @murpi nice map
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> This is Pulsars background :D
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> and map
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok then credit to him üòÑ
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> It's from his map called Orion, really pretty indeed
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Jupstar ‚ú™ i think ingame it looks fine without rounded edges too
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mh ok, i think it's mixed.. scoreboard looks bit strange when its so edgy, but im also just used to it
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> the button shadows are basically invisible tho
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe we need less transparency for the dark maps anyway
23:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> jungle night is also very dark
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Welf> i was so confused "omg murpi made a map?" then i looked it up and didn't find it
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> murpi ghostmapper
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @BannZay i really like that idea, also thought about this(not for editor tho)
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> now that i cleaned up the map stuff, we can actually display many maps anywhere
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> btw @Jupstar ‚ú™ are you planning to update the editor rendering as well?
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> im a sheep
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Ravie maybe some day xd
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> but i'd just adapt 0.7's rendering
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> it can be a little annoying to have to actually host a map to see how it "really" looks
