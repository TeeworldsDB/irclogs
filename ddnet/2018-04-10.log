11:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Building ddnet got so annoying ._.
11:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i did Update and upgrade
11:06 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But idk how to Update cmake
11:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Also i get many Client related errors ._.
11:07 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> But i did ``cmake .. -DClient=OFF``
11:14 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> change your apt list and make apt-get dist-upgrade after update
11:40 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> How do i Change apt list?
11:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Btw it build idk but it seems to be working alltough it has errors
11:54 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i just didnt build the thing in the warning probs
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just google apt sources.list
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno what distribution you do use, but you will find what you need to upgrade everything
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> it just didnt build the thing in the warning probs
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just google apt sources.list
11:55 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno what distribution you do use, but you will find what you need to upgrade everything
12:01 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> you only need newer cmake if you want to make a release
12:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> use cmake -DCLIENT=OFF (capitalized)
12:02 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> are you planning to run ddnet-server on your phone?
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™  i tried to search in the web i use debian btw
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @deen by release u mean the oppisite of debug or a full ddnet release for all operating systems and so on?
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> ah capitalized thanks
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> 
14:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xD no i just dont have anything better than my phone at school so i use my vps to play around
15:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> debian apt sources.list first entry on google.
15:11 < bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> But since you probably just want a working executable, you don't need to update your system
15:13 <@deen> by release I meant the full ddnet release
15:14 <@deen> to build a tar file you need cpack and we only support that with new cmake or sth like that
15:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> konsti says that "cps are a little bugged in the new version"
15:23 < bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/386551867276132354/433139741387390978/screenshot_2018-04-10_07-36-56.png
15:25 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> google .-.
15:39 < bridge> [ddnet] <Wombat> is ddnet.tw down?
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/A0cbt/0fada7d45d.jpg
15:59 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its working for me @Wombat
17:17 < bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Has a "ping" tool √† la LoL been discussed already? For pointing directions etc?
17:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @CptDalv what's that?
17:41 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we have twping
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> make twping
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ./twping ger.ddnet.tw
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> 7.675 ms
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Don't know about that
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Ah no
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> üòÑ
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Not the actual ping ^^
17:42 < bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> On keypress open a context menu at the cursor where you can select an action like "go there" "hook" etc. which will be shown to nearby players
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That's pistol
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> + emoticons
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> pistol + WTF = what the fuck did you there?
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> pistol + ‚ù§ = good job there
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> etc
17:43 < bridge> [ddnet] <CptDalv> Ok right üòÉ
17:53 < bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats cute
18:38 < bridge> [ddnet] <n000b> <3
19:26 < bridge> [ddnet] <Wombat> ddnet is rejecting connection to me :/
19:29 < bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Wombat GER or all?
19:30 < bridge> [ddnet] <Wombat> @deen ddnet.tw
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> any sqlians here?
21:12 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> i need a query that gives me name kills and rank with this kills of a player
21:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=teeworlds+movie
21:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> woops
21:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/server/score/sql_score.cpp#L1176
21:19 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> can someone explain this line of sql? o.O
21:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> does it even work with sqlite? .-.
21:28 < bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/A0nm7/a0ea815a9f.png
22:22 <@deen> no, probably not
22:22 <@deen> that's using lots of mysql specific stuff
22:23 <@deen> the problem for DDNet was that we want people to have the same rank if they have the exact same time
22:23 <@deen> that's why this query is so complicated
22:24 <@deen> if you don't have that restriction you can do it much easier
22:26 <@deen> you're using sqlite?
22:26 <@deen> any experiences? multiple processes?
22:26 <@deen> or even synced across multiple servers?
