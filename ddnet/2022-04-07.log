11:48 <+ChillerDragon> when you plugin ur phone and suddenly icons of the 90s popup https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1649324864.png
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.windows93.net/
13:25 <+ChillerDragon> wow that works well
13:26 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1649330793.png
13:26 <+ChillerDragon> aaa i got virus
14:16 <+ChillerDragon> Any idea how to build a str_utf8_slug that slugs out all the nasty utf8 characters?
14:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> just slug char higher than 256
14:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 256 is extended ascii it has the accents and german stuff
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ChillerDragon: loop through with str_utf8_decode and create a new string with only the codepoints you like
14:30 <+ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/P2
14:30 <+ChillerDragon> yea thats what i tried but it doesnt work at all :C
14:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> pStrning
14:30 <+ChillerDragon> ikr
14:31 <+ChillerDragon> I do not even know which characters i want. Maybe its not a slug issue but a font issue. My terminal prints some chars out of the plain ascii range and others become something like ~~√ê
14:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then fix your terminal and don't remove unicode üòÑ
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> even dat emojii printed
14:32 <+ChillerDragon> is it a font or terminal issue? any ideas
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1649334806.png
14:33 <+ChillerDragon> yea xterm doesnt look better
14:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> font probs
14:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> or encoding problem
14:35 <+ChillerDragon> where to buy better fonts
14:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> can you `cat` regular utf8 files?
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i uses jetbrains mono but if u want oldschool maybe u can tryr http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they claim to support many chars
14:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> every terminal should switch to a fallback font for what isn't available, so it shouldn't be a font problem
14:38 <+ChillerDragon> yea i can cat it
14:39 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1649335160.png
14:39 <+ChillerDragon> maybe its a curses issue? is that possible
14:40 <+ChillerDragon> normal ddnet client log prints it fine. But curses log does not. Or do i have to be careful when passing around utf8 strings before printing them?
14:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, you probably have to set curses to utf8 mode
14:48 <+ChillerDragon> Yea that sounds like the issue thanks deen lets see if i can link the other fakin curses version -.-
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> Wooow all that effort to get utf8 working ... and it still messes up my table haha.
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1649337054.png
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> kill me
15:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I'm in this picture and I don't like it
15:16 <+ChillerDragon> is this some reply or do you talk about my serverbrowser?
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Come to Discord and find out
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> fakof -.-
15:17 <+ChillerDragon> i just assume you are not talking to me :p
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I did tho
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> oo
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> wdym then? o.O 
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> trol
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> u
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> you dont like the picture? :c
15:18 <+ChillerDragon> its hot
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> table unaligned
15:20 <+ChillerDragon> yea well that the point
15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Fix it
15:21 <+ChillerDragon> im on it mf
15:21 <+ChillerDragon> im just sharing my sadness

15:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37397118/how-to-detect-unicode-string-width-in-terminal
15:22 <+ChillerDragon> dont we have something in system.h ?
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
15:23 <+ChillerDragon> str_utf8_stats
15:23 <+ChillerDragon> count - Pointer to store count of utf8 characters of the string.
15:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> pro
15:23 <+ChillerDragon> yea not sure if size helps tho
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> maybe, bcs then u maybe can calculate back and know how many spaces to append
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> yea but the i have to do it manually
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> currently str_format() does the padding for me why dis bitsh cant count
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> when str_utf8_format xd
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Then kys?
15:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
15:24 <+ChillerDragon> ye
15:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> str format does the padding? wym?
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> str_format("%-20s", "foo");
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> prints 20 space padded "foo" 
15:25 <+ChillerDragon> but yea i can do str_format("%-*s", pad, foo) and do calc
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> ah, well yes but dont you need different space counts anyways for each server?
15:26 <+ChillerDragon> if its below 20 it werks
15:26 <+ChillerDragon> and if its not utf8
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> eh ok
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> then do the old tw style and print utf8 as a box []
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> you mean replace utf8 chars?
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> yea that was my initial attempt
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> is bad approach tho
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> ye
15:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> utf8 in consoles always pain
15:27 <+ChillerDragon> fixing utf8 was a nice thing todo
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i'll have breakfast now
15:28 <+ChillerDragon> its 15:28

16:06 <+ChillerDragon> thats feature not bug :D 
16:06 <+ChillerDragon> to "highlight" the selected server
16:07 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/chillerbot/chillerbot-ux/commit/097fc45c6f5cf12c94bd29af191eb5208f6d69ac
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> why dont u color it or smth

16:08 <+ChillerDragon> yea color didnt work
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> give it a try again soon(tm)
16:08 <+ChillerDragon> i wanted bold
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xd
16:09 <+ChillerDragon> but identation is also pretty pleasing feedback for now
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1649341726.png
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> I managed to get it bold. I was missing the indentation effect so I added it without breaking the columns
16:29 <+ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut mr opionion u like now?
16:30 <+ChillerDragon> omg dont mind servers.json in the bottom right corner xd
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> gud

18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Support for LLVM-based coverage instrumentation has been stabilized in rustc. You can try this out on your code by rebuilding your code with -Cinstrument-coverage, for example like this:
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > 
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > RUSTFLAGS="-C instrument-coverage" cargo build
18:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :BASED:
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> Sorry if my question is dumb, I havent checked out the code at all, but would be possible to code Bullets to be able to unfreeze you?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> there already is such a feature
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no, there isnt
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> there are only the plasma guns
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> those can unfreeze u
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> plasma bullets u mean?
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> xd
20:01 <+ChillerDragon> @APFFF so yes there is a way
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> Yeah, not instant like the laser, with traveltime like the bullet
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> yeah its not insteant
20:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> it shoots plasma bullets
20:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <! WTFremaG> a new gun pls :U
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> its a tile
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/961687894647513118/unknown.png
20:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> lasers have travel time if you force wallshots
20:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar> but yes for the weapon it would be possible too, pretty ez
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> the name in code is plasma gun tho xd
21:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, it would be possible as weapon too, i have that on my server
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> would be so cool to disable hammer-unfreeze and use the gun for that
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <APFFF> Like Teleport-Gun Tile
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> u should add a tile that instead of kills you it bans u
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> hey, i know it's not intended place to do that, but could someone with 5 min of free time and google chrome help me by giving feedback on my chrome extension ü§î?

22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Knuski> :Susge:
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> should delete it üòü ?
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> im not sure if anyone is happy about "build.zip" in the developer channel
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> it's gone
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> maybe a link is better
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <lynn> #off-topic is probably a better place for it honestly
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RadziSzop> make sense
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> Hey, i think it would be great if we had the ability to disable or why not change the displayed settings of the discord rich discord, can i make a PR for that? Or is it something you don't want to change? ive been thinking about this for so long.
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> Hey, i think it would be great if we had the ability to disable or why not change the displayed settings of the discord rich presence, can i make a PR for that? Or is it something you don't want to change? ive been thinking about this for so long.
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you can do that directly in discord, lol
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <nouaa> Yeah but it will desactivate it for all games
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you can toggle it for individual games and also change their names
23:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @heinrich5991 @Learath2 @Not Keks anyone want to review https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4895 ? People keep losing their ranks because of this
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Looks sane to me
23:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> let me think about the edge cases for a min, then I'll merge
