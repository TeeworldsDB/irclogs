13:41 < Nimda> Angry by KBeeeR just released on Moderate at 2014-11-30 13:39
13:50 <@deen> oh wow, 340 players just in europe
13:50 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
13:50 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 398
13:50 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
13:50 <@deen> 400 even with chile down
13:59 <@deen> it's really funny how hosters don't know their own business terms
13:59 <@deen> third time I'm correcting them now^^
14:01 <@EastByte> what exactly was it about? ^^
14:01 <@deen> It's always about me getting out of their weird contracts
14:01 <@deen> but I was always right in understanding the terms, so I'm out without problems :P
14:02 <@deen> This time gametekk wanted to keep me 1 month longer and not allow me to cancel by email
14:03 <@EastByte> well^^
14:04 <@EastByte> hm looks like my haphost free vps stays forever, I just need to click on renewal every month
14:05 <@deen> nice
14:05 <@deen> my brother tried to get one as well but they declined^^
14:05 <@EastByte> interesting
14:05 <@EastByte> my email doesn't look trustable at all
14:05 <@EastByte> and my name isn't real either...
14:05 <@EastByte> nvm
14:57 <@EastByte> deen: looks like all private ovh ips are blacklisted here: http://www.spamsources.fabel.dk/lookup
14:59 <@deen> meh
16:48 < xRoThx> Hello
16:48 < xRoThx> http://teeserver.de/ Finally the release? 
17:03 < WolfAlex> lol
17:18 <@EastByte> xRoThx: depends on the timezone you are in
17:18 <@EastByte> for me, 1 day left
17:19 <@EastByte> xRoThx: so what about your project?
18:20 < xRoThx> EastByte:  well.. After 4 attempts I think this one can actually make such an interface
18:20 < xRoThx> & I shrinked my demand a little bit.. :P 
18:27 < xRoThx> How are the ddos attacks going on EUR? Do they bring much trouble? 
18:28 <@EastByte> last week it got kind of unstable
18:28 <@EastByte> let's see whether there will be attacks today
18:29 < xRoThx> I will probably not be here for the tournament :) 
18:29 < BeaR> http://ddnet.tw/ping/ looks ok
18:30 < xRoThx> ger has the highest pings.. 
18:30 < xRoThx> Most played aswell.. 
18:30 <@EastByte> it's because of deen's connection
18:30 <@EastByte> I never have a highping there
18:33 < xRoThx> me neither
18:33 < xRoThx> hoow about your projects EastByte 
18:33 <@EastByte> still a great amount of players are having problems with that
18:33 <@EastByte> currently not much time for teeworlds
18:34 <@EastByte> but I added multibind support to ddnet for testing purposes^^
18:35 <@EastByte> have you seen some work of your "php coder" yet?
18:38 <@EastByte> gawd
18:39 < BeaR> ^^
19:08 <@deen> ddnet usa is going down permanently
19:12 < BeaR> 'Angry' could need some quality check 
19:33 <@EastByte> deen: don't forget to "hide" your ip for the tournament
19:35 <@deen> EastByte: don't really care, back in 1 min if i get ddosed
19:35 <@EastByte> I would care ^^
19:39 < BeaR> someone knows if windows 10 tech preview already contains dx12 ?
19:47 <@deen> Tournament in 14 min
20:23 <@deen> server lags on EUR
20:25 <@EastByte> traffic looks normal
20:40 < eeeee> why usa going down?
20:50 <@deen> eeeee: no more money
20:52 < eeeee> how much was it?
20:54 <@deen> 10 $ / month
21:05 < eeeee> :/
21:06 < eeeee> which one is that? i'll get it back
21:08 <@deen> ddnet USA
21:09 < eeeee> no i meant which hoster
21:14 <@deen> nfoservers
21:14 <@deen> same as for GER
21:21 < Nimda> Nirvana by ħίɴɖU & Kayumi just released on Brutal at 2014-11-30 19:57
21:24 <@deen> I guess it would be best to have a system so we can collect donations for servers
21:25 <@deen> and you can see on the website for how long each server has money
21:25 <@deen> hm
21:26 < eeeee> you could start with collecting donations manually
21:26 < eeeee> and worry about the system when you get overwhelmed by donations ;)
21:26 <@deen> but then I would receive the donations
21:26 <@deen> and I'm not even paying most of the servers
21:27 <@deen> so that would be unfair
21:28 < eeeee> donors could specify what server they want to support and then you aggregate the donations and transfer them to whoever pays the server?
21:29 < eeeee> sounds like a lot of work when you put it that way :/
21:29 <@deen> yeah, think so too
21:55 <@EastByte> deen: I'm writing a damn upload web app now
22:53 < eeeee> EastByte: for uploading what?
23:01 < xrothx> deen:  You need a new USA? 
23:12 <@deen> xrothx: i think Broken has been getting people who want to help pay
23:13 <@EastByte> eeeee: for uploading normal files (one click hoster like)
23:13 < xrothx> if its just 10$ I will do it
23:13 < xrothx> the linux single core? 
23:14 <@deen> xrothx: get in touch with Broken. I think he has a few sponsors now
23:14 < xrothx> Broken? 
23:14 <@deen> He's running DDNet USA
23:14 < xrothx> oh, but if he found it
23:14 < xrothx> its alright
23:15 < xrothx> I can take it when needed if you want
23:15 < xrothx> might be intresting to make a USA east & USA West server? 
23:15 <@deen> Haha
23:15 < xrothx> because USA is a big as whole europe? :P 
23:15 <@deen> Yeah, lets split the total of 20 north american players on 4 servers
23:16 < xrothx> lmao
23:16 <@EastByte> 20 players? did the number increase?
23:16 < eeeee> we clearly need separate servers for CA and WA
23:16 < eeeee> ping is too damn high
23:16 <@deen> Interesting locations for me are Iran and maybe Turkex
23:16 <@deen> Turkey*
23:17 < xrothx> iran /= found
23:17 <@deen> My guess would be that Broken wants to shut down USA because we're running CAN now
23:17 < xrothx> !ddnet peak
23:17 < xrothx> !peak
23:17 < Nimda> Current channel peak for #ddnet: 26 users online at 2014-10-07 22:44:23 (54 days, 1 hour, 33 minutes and 29 seconds ago)
23:18 < xrothx> !player peak
23:18 < xrothx> !ddnetpeak
23:18 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 175
23:18 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
23:20 < xrothx> deen: Alright, no USA intrest? :P
23:20 < xrothx> I can take it over if you like
23:20 <@deen> nope
23:20 <@deen> you have to discuss with Broken
23:20 < xrothx> ok
23:20 < xrothx> btw deen 
23:20 < xrothx> I have read something about the donations
23:21 <@deen> yes
23:21 < xrothx> When you accept it letme kknow the link
23:21 <@deen> i don't know how we should accept them
23:21 < xrothx> I will send people that wanted to donate to you
23:21 < xrothx> moment
23:21 < xrothx> will try something
23:21 < xrothx> little chance that GER goes down a moment
23:21 < xrothx> but normally it shouldn't
23:22 <@deen> sounds dangerous
23:24 <@deen> i wouldn't know how to spread the donations between the servers
23:25 < eeeee> but isnt that only a problem if you don't have enough donations to keep all servers running?
23:26 < xrothx> deen:  on the donation page you make a dropdown choice menu thingy ^^
23:26 <@deen> even if we just get 10 € / month it's unfair if i keep it all
23:26 < xrothx> deen:  give them the choice to what they want to donate
23:29 <@deen> and then I make paypal rich by resending the donation
23:29 <@deen> person X wants to donate
23:29 <@deen> X -> deen -> xrothx -> nfoservers
23:29 < eeeee> if only btc was more widespread
23:30 < xrothx> deen: 
23:30 <@deen> yay, paying to paypal 3 times!
23:30 < xrothx> X -> deen -> nfoservers
23:30 <@deen> xrothx: but you're running GER
23:31 <@deen> or is that your way of saying you don't want to pay it anymore?^^
23:31 < xrothx> No
23:31 < xrothx> That is my way of saying you should finally allow donations again
23:32 <@deen> have to make a new paypal account again^^
23:32 <@deen> eeeee: i don't like bitcoin much for other reasons
23:32 <@deen> ah wait, my old paypal account still works
23:32 < eeeee> like what?
23:33 <@deen> waste of resources for mining
23:33 < eeeee> i used bitcoin once and it was great
23:33 <@deen> people who started early have an advantage
23:33 <@deen> they have billions of dollars in bitcoins now, right?
23:33 < eeeee> i recieved money and nobody asked me for scan of id and a photo of my house
23:34 < eeeee> (like paypal did)
23:34 <@deen> yeah, that part is nice
23:34 <@deen> wow, paypal didn't want anything from me
23:34 <@EastByte> there is a person who send me 0.5 btc once :D (@ WolfAlex)
23:34 <@deen> well, i could accept bitcoins too if anyone wants to donate in bitcoins
23:35 <@deen> at least you can send money to friends for free with paypal now
23:35 <@deen> (in some counries...)
23:38 <@deen> maybe ddnet isn't the right project to collect donations anyway^^
23:38 <@deen> our streamer got more donations than we did back then
23:39 < eeeee> i'm trying to finish the js demo player, but freetype is a bitch to compile
23:39 <@deen> =/
23:39 < eeeee> got seekbar working though
23:39 <@deen> nice
23:40 < xrothx> deen:  do you need that 3gbram? 
23:40 < xrothx> deen:  do you need that 3gb ram? 
23:40 < xrothx> and those 3 cores? 
23:40 <@deen> xrothx: it's a bit much, 2 GB would be fine as well
23:40 < xrothx> okay
23:40 < xrothx> Then I think I will downgrade
23:40 <@deen> 2 cores could be fine
23:40 <@deen> would have to see
23:40 < xrothx> useless to keep on paying 
23:40 < xrothx> ok
23:41 < xrothx> can get 15€/month reduction with lower package :)
23:41 < xrothx> worth to change I think ^^
23:41 <@deen> yeah, nfoservers is pretty expensive
23:41 < xrothx> but good ^^
23:42 <@deen> yeah, best performance of all servers I've ever seen
23:43 < xrothx> ok
23:44 < xrothx> in about a week I will order the 2gb one
23:44 <@deen> There we go: http://ddnet.tw
23:44 <@deen> Donations on the right side
23:44 < xrothx> then you have a couple days to move everything
23:44 <@deen> xrothx: you can't keep it on the same IP? =/
23:44 <@deen> downgrade directly
23:44 <@deen> most players have the servers in their favorites, would be a shame if that gets lost
23:45 <@deen> should i add an information about how much has been donated?
23:45 <@deen> or even how much should be donated per month to keep it running?
23:46 < xrothx> you should make a progressbar
23:46 <@deen> for each month?
23:47 < xrothx> I saw on another community (minecraft thing) 
23:47 < xrothx> they ask for example 250$/month to keep it up etc
23:48 < xrothx> and after that they just take it over to next month
23:48 < xrothx> you can make progressbars for every server if you want
23:49 <@deen> i don't even know what the goal is^^
23:49 < xrothx> me neither :P 
23:49 <@deen> lets leave it like this for now
23:49 < xrothx> I think most easy thing is to make a choice of donation
23:49 < xrothx> they can choose to what they choose to donate
23:49 <@deen> why would that be easy?^^
23:49 < xrothx> and then you can contact the owner & donate it to him/her
23:50 <@deen> what owner?
23:50 < xrothx> owner of the site/server/ts/..
23:50 <@deen> ah ok, so we're not talking about ddnet specifically now?
23:50 < xrothx> for example, donate to ddnet.tw - usa.ddnet.tw - ger.ddnet.tw - etc
23:50 < xrothx> and once you earn pretty good on it
23:50 <@deen> earn?^^
23:51 < xrothx> you can start using it as an income to grow the amount of servers
23:51 < xrothx> yes
23:51 <@deen> we'll never get enough donations to even keep it running
23:51 <@deen> i was happy with 20 € / month before
23:51 < xrothx> Ofcourse you will ;) Stay positive :)
23:52 < xrothx> I have had a couple players asking me how they can donate to me
23:53 < xrothx> I told them to wait for the webinterface, but if you can make it already I will be happy to send them through you
23:53 <@deen> yeah, i had that all the time too
23:53 <@deen> but they usually never donate :P
23:53 < xrothx> well, we can only find out :)
