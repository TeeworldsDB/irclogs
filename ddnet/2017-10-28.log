00:05 <+Wuzzy> hi. i want to help on the German translation. how do I start?
00:07 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> What do you want to translate?
00:07 <+Wuzzy> the client
00:08 <+Wuzzy> and maybe server messages (if this is even possible)
00:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/data/languages/german.txt
00:08 <+Wuzzy> okay. where do i post the file when I'm done? :)
00:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> on github
00:08 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> via pull request
00:09 <+Wuzzy> works for me
00:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can click that http://www.wasz.ovh/img/s34z3gck98604
00:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> button
00:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it should made pr request, after editing
00:09 <+Wuzzy> DDNet isn't on Transfex like Teeworlds, right
00:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i don't think so
00:09 <+Wuzzy> ok, no big deal
00:09 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> also, i don't think so that ddnet support custom serverside messages
00:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i mean, custom languages
00:10 <+Wuzzy> anything else i need to know?
00:10 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but maybe i am wrong ðŸ˜„ @Learath2  ?
00:10 <+Wuzzy> i mean, any weeeeird oddities?
00:10 <+Learath2> we don't have server messages translated yep
00:11 <+Learath2> Wuzzy: if there is some text in the client that refuses to be translated, hit me up i'll check
00:11 <+Wuzzy> good to know, thx
00:13 <+Wuzzy> "Clan plates size" ... what's this?
00:13 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I don't know, how open is this: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/612
00:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but maybe it's worth seeing]
00:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Clan plates size
00:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> clan text under the nickname
00:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you cna enable it in settings
00:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and changes it font-size
00:14 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> and change it font-size
00:37 <+Wuzzy> some untranslatable strings I found:
00:37 <+Wuzzy> Friend message
00:37 <+Wuzzy> '<Player>' entered and joined the spectators
00:37 <+Wuzzy> Date
00:37 <+Wuzzy> also, most labels in the Controls menu appear to be untranslatalbe
00:37 <+Wuzzy> note the spectator message appears in the settings
00:37 <+Wuzzy> "Date" is in demos tab
00:38 <+Wuzzy> Learath2: ^
00:42 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> what strings exactly
00:43 <+Wuzzy> i just posted them
00:44 <+Wuzzy> exactly
00:44 <+Wuzzy> so you should be able to grep them, I guess
00:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> "Friend message'?
00:44 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> " '<Player>' entered and joined the spectators" ?
00:44 <+Wuzzy> yes
00:44 <+Wuzzy> yes
00:45 <+Wuzzy> this can be found in settings
00:45 <+Wuzzy> as an example
00:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Yes, but some string shouldn't be translated like " '<Player>' entered and joined the spectators"
00:45 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> because it's the message,w hich server send to you
00:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> So everyone has the same
00:46 <+Wuzzy> no no no you misunderstand
00:46 <+Wuzzy> this string actually appears in the client
00:46 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yes, but it looks the same when you join server
00:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so it would be bad to translate it, no?
00:47 <+Wuzzy> ...
00:47 <+Wuzzy> Settings â†’ HUD
00:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I understand
00:47 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's there
00:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but i don't see sense, to translate it
00:48 <+Wuzzy> these examples are all translated for some reason
00:48 <+Wuzzy> except the spectator thing
00:48 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> But oother messages aren't hardcoded ðŸ˜„
00:49 <+Wuzzy> hmm the fact that server messages can not be translated seems like a design flaw to me but anyway...
00:49 <+Wuzzy> many games are unable to do that, not that it's an excuse :D
00:49 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> :d
00:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i think you can add new translation like
00:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Friend message
00:50 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> == Translation
00:50 <+Wuzzy> no, doesnt work
00:50 <+Wuzzy> i run the copyfix thingie
00:51 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> right, Friend message couldn't be translate
00:51 <+Wuzzy> oh, and i noticd the Reset button in many menus is too short. if translation is only ca. 3 chars longer, it overlaps the button
00:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> @Learath2 if I add "Localize("Friend message")" Then it should be translatable ?
00:53 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/cb00a294b82ec3f275cb00733b8dce91b4875a54/src/game/client/components/menus_settings.cpp#L1690
00:54 <+Learath2> 1690 and 1693 so the length is properly calculated
00:55 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> huh?
00:59 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Jupeyy opened pull request #931: Add Speedup tiles correctly at the border creation (master...master) https://git.io/vFkMz
01:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Learath2> you need to get both the lines where i used "Friend message" @Savander
01:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> okay
01:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Wuzzy, what is not translatable?
01:04 <+Wuzzy> the following:
01:04 <+Wuzzy> Friend message
01:04 <+Wuzzy> Dat
01:04 <+Wuzzy> oops, wrong string
01:05 <+Wuzzy> Date
01:05 <+Wuzzy> "Date" is in demos tab
01:05 <+Wuzzy> and "Friend message" is somewhere in HUD settings
01:12 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> that's it ?
01:19 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] Wuzzy2 opened pull request #932: Update German translation (27 Oct 2017 UTC) (master...de) https://git.io/vFkDp
01:20 <+Wuzzy> Savander: I don't know. that's just what I found so far
01:20 <+Wuzzy> these 2 strings are the strings I found through a quick skimming through the whole program.
01:20 <+Wuzzy> oh, wait. most controls are untranslatable atm
01:21 <+Wuzzy> and most of the editor, but you prob. know that
01:21 <+Wuzzy> it's a shame that buttons seem to have a fixed length ... anyway. German translation is up. see above :-)
01:24 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] savander opened pull request #933: Small localize update (master...master) https://git.io/vFkyn
01:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/cb00a294b82ec3f275cb00733b8dce91b4875a54/src/game/client/components/menus_settings.cpp#L714-L719
01:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Toggle dyncame etc, shouldn't be added tehre?
01:26 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> there?
01:26 <+Wuzzy> by the way: the amount of players I see online is surprisingly high. how did you manage to attact so many players? :)
01:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> DDNet offers servers around the world
01:27 <+Wuzzy> that alone doesn't mean much. a game can have millions of servers but still nobody plays
01:27 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> And few years ago it was best alternative to ddmax, then ddnet went huge and well developed
01:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> All the time new maps for ddrace, updates
01:28 <+Wuzzy> ah. high dev activity is always a plus
01:28 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> DDnet has 4 or 5 years
01:29 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think people got used to it
01:29 <+Wuzzy> i know many FOSS games which really struggle to attact more than a serverfull of players at a time
01:30 <+Wuzzy> one sad example is Xonotic
01:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> FOSS games?
01:30 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ah, open source
01:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I don't know why people Like teeworlds, i can't say ðŸ˜›
01:31 <+Wuzzy> probably because of its simplicity. :D
01:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I stay with Teeworlds for 9/10 years
01:31 <+Wuzzy> i even played it in a LAN party once. it was great
01:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, teeworlds it's simple, but hard to skill
01:31 <+Wuzzy> ah, LAN parties. those were the times
01:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> you can't be like really good in few weeks
01:31 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> it's impossible
01:32 <+Wuzzy> the grenade launcher is tricky
01:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> maybe that's why people stick to that game
01:32 <+Wuzzy> and i suck at the ninja mode :D i often get killed too fast
01:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ninja mode? ðŸ˜›
01:32 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ah, katana
01:33 <+Wuzzy> i'm not very faminlar with the Officially Sancioned Teeworlds Terminology(TM), sorry
01:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Tbh, most useless weapon in game :PPP
01:33 <+Wuzzy> but its fun as hell
01:33 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> at least on clan level
01:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea, but it's just katana
01:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> i mean, it looks like a ninja sword
01:34 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> xD
01:35 <+Wuzzy> Savander: about line 714. this looks suspiciously like a common localization trick, due to the way how string collection scripts work
01:36 <+Wuzzy> even if i know nothing about the code, I'm pretty certain this is where you'd add controls strings
01:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Im not familiar with C/C++, but if i understand, it's used by external progrma
01:37 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but by C/C++ code itselfs ( because it's comment")
01:38 <+Wuzzy> well, in gettext the trick is to put gettext_noop("Your string") somewhere
01:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> But i think, that structure, has list of localize options
01:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> so probably we cna translate strings
01:38 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Without changing anything :PPP
01:38 <+Wuzzy> gettext_noop just returns "Your string", but the scripts will search the source files for everything enclosed in "gettext_noop"
01:39 <+Wuzzy> its a little clever hack, actually
01:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> anyway
01:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> we can translate whole settings tab
01:39 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> yea
01:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I mean, Control
01:40 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Good night
01:40 <+Wuzzy> yeah, in data/languages/scripts/twlang.py, you can see that it just looks for "Localize" things. pretty simple
01:40 <+Wuzzy> good night :)
01:41 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> Please don't translate map into "Karte" ðŸ˜„
01:43 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> and "Indicate map finish" means that it shows whether you finished a map or not, not to show the finish on a map
01:43 <+Wuzzy> well... translation can only be as good as the source string :(
01:44 <+Wuzzy> if the source string is broken, you cant blame translator
01:44 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> and "Unfinished map" means wehter you finished a run on the map, not that the map itself is unfinished
01:44 <+Wuzzy> btw map was translted to "Karte" before
01:44 <+Wuzzy> jao, feel free to fix :P
01:44 <+Wuzzy> but "Karte" is a common translation in other games, i don't see a problem
01:45 <+Wuzzy> Stop Denglisch!
01:45 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> ðŸ˜¦
01:45 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> "Freundnachricht" sounds wrong too
01:46 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> most of it looks good tho ðŸ˜›
01:47 <+Wuzzy> "Unfinished map" seems to be wrong source string then
01:48 <+Wuzzy> but given the very tight space, it's hard to think of a better string :(
01:48 <+Wuzzy> "Map in which no player managed to reach the finish line" is too long ;)
01:49 <+Wuzzy> maybe "Nobody reached finish line"
01:49 <+Wuzzy> ?
01:49 <+Wuzzy> or "Nobody finished"
01:50 <+Wuzzy> jao, I still don't get "Indicate map finish"... what exactly happens if this is on?
01:51 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> It indicates if you finished a map or not
01:52 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> g2g now ðŸ˜ƒ
02:21 <+ddnet-discord> <jao> as a player finished the race on a certain map* sry ðŸ˜„

11:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> fps still goes down zooming out
11:16 <+ddnet-discord> <Mokuz> Does it go down as much as before?
11:22 <+ddnet-discord> <Ryozuki> ye
15:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> can u bind a "call vote" option?
15:57 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> ?
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> in client u can call votes like kick this player or change settings like to novice
15:58 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> is there a way to bind it?
16:00 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> em, i don't think so? why would you do that? Votes changes
16:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> for a different mod
16:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> block mod
16:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> has a vote system now like teetown
16:01 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> where u can enable and disable special features
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> Probably, you can bind it
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> but how, don't ask me
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> callvote accepts 3 arqs
16:02 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> callvote "Name" "command" "reason"
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> probably, you would have to know exactly all of the arqs, but
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> its possible that callvote is disabled
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> from executing via console
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> i think you can ima test it out
16:03 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> hm
16:06 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I think, you can't do that
16:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> "callvote "Name" "command" "reason""
16:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> what would "command be"
16:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Ezy> what would "command" be
16:11 <+ddnet-discord> <Savander> I don't know, probably the command from vote
