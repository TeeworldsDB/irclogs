11:37 < bridge> <oxyzo.> how do i make pull requests on github:owo:
11:39 < bridge> <melo∆û> fork it, do your changes (preferably on a different branch) - and then use the github webpage to create a Pull request from your fork to upstream
11:40 < bridge> <alw5> and squash your commits
11:40 < bridge> <alw5> if needed
11:40 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ~~not squashing your commits moves you up the contributor list faster~~
11:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> /s
11:41 < bridge> <TsPiggy> do squash please
11:41 < bridge> <alw5> true it does
11:44 < bridge> <melo∆û> we only squash if the changes are minimal
11:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> some PR's need split commits, like roby's, because he does multiple features in one PR but spread across multiple commits
12:46 < bridge> <learath2> That's why I never squash

14:43 < bridge> <nameless_me> hmm, does anyone know if servers will only accept cleints? or if only cleints can recive the packets? How do you conenct to a local server?
14:44 < bridge> <ljpb> does bugs stupid bam ban damn
14:47 < bridge> <melo∆û> not ddnet - ask the person whose source you use.
14:55 < furo> @nameless_me What do you mean? Are you asking if it's possible to create your own client implementation?
14:57 < bridge> <nameless_me> I'm asking if you can connect to your own server with a cleint/program hybrid, I want to be able to recive server info, but I don't just want a playable cleint, i'm asking if its possible to do this
15:01 < furo> You can take a look at https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/index.html It has some documentation about the protocol and lists some existing client implementations
15:02 < bridge> <nameless_me> thank you
15:04 < bridge> <Assa> this is not even physics related üò¶
15:10 < bridge> <pioooooo> is there some list of all supported emoji of ddnet
15:11 < bridge> <zhn> all emojis thats supported by dejavusans font ig
15:40 < bridge> <melo∆û> Yearly cleanup ?
15:41 < bridge> <Assa> They are all ~20 minutes old, I guess bot stuck or something
15:43 < bridge> <kebscs> no, its just closed issues from my single pr üòÇ
18:54 < bridge> <kebscs> can i see `character@netobj.ddnet.tw` with wireshark dissector?
19:09 < bridge> <Assa> All my PRs now ready again :happy:
19:38 < bridge> <kebscs> can i see `character@netobj.ddnet.tw` with wireshark dissector? nvm tested other way
19:58 < bridge> <hectavoxel> kebs casually saving ddnet
20:11 < bridge> <kebscs> now that i know exactly how tunes work
20:11 < bridge> <kebscs> ill try to add new tile that locks tune on the player
20:26 < bridge> <whatahellebanarot> How can i setup server with mysql on windows?
20:57 < bridge> <Assa> may take a look at my global_tuning issue üòÑ
21:03 < bridge> <kebscs> i see, idk how would that work
21:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @kebscs the dissector supports ddnet message extensions but sadly it can not do snap items yet. I usually merge into this pr and patch in the 2 lines that dump the snap https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8189
21:41 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> ``GameClient()->GetNetObjHandler()->DebugDumpSnapshot(pTmpBuffer3);``
21:44 < bridge> <kebscs> ty but bit late, figured it out without wireshark :kek:
22:06 < bridge> <kebscs> when touching tune lock off tile, should it still have the tune's values or instantly off?
22:07 < bridge> <kebscs> breaks prediction on older clients if standing in it
22:07 < bridge> <kebscs> breaks prediction on older clients if standing in it, but i prefer instantly off
22:16 < bridge> <Assa> can you explain further what you mean? you enter a tune lock tile, and your tunings can't change anymore until you enter a tune unlock tile?
22:19 < bridge> <kebscs> yes this is how it works
22:19 < bridge> <Assa> I thought you were implementing a tune-setting tile. you enter the tune setting tile and your tuning won't change when you enter the default tune zone (0)
22:19 < bridge> <kebscs> yes
22:20 < bridge> <kebscs> theres 2 new tiles, tune lock and tune lock off
22:20 < bridge> <Assa> I described a different tile, no?
22:20 < bridge> <Assa> I described a different tile, no? (just asking)
22:21 < bridge> <Assa> I mean it this way, if you enter a new tune-setting tile, it'll overwrite. If you enter a zone where no tune tile is set, your tuning stays
22:21 < bridge> <kebscs> this is how tune override works
22:21 < bridge> <Assa> and then a reset tile
22:22 < bridge> <kebscs> yea i implemented that already
22:22 < bridge> <kebscs> just were asking if you touch reset tile should it instantly turn the tuning to global
22:22 < bridge> <kebscs> or when you leave it
22:22 < bridge> <Assa> I would do it instantly, since these are probably skippable anyway
22:23 < bridge> <Assa> also this is what I'd expect
22:23 < bridge> <Assa> also this is what I'd expect as a mapper
22:23 < bridge> <Assa> tuning tiles themselfes also apply instantly
22:23 < bridge> <kebscs> alright ty
22:24 < bridge> <Assa> I would do it instantly, since these are probably skippable* anyway
22:24 < bridge> <Assa> skippable* = Post Tick applied

22:35 < bridge> <Solly> ```
22:35 < bridge> <Solly> this has never worked for me, i have had to push all the way left to get it to press
22:35 < bridge> <Assa> if your deadzone in the mud?
22:35 < bridge> <Assa> is your deadzone in the mud?
22:35 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1345509784836902922/image.png?ex=67c4cf23&is=67c37da3&hm=540ff7c548f5b8a2925fe389a9789dded847c68b318b4fd0f02e4083bc250cad&
22:36 < bridge> <Solly> when axis 3 goes further left than the deadzone its supposed to make me go left (since ive done bind joy_axis3_left +left)
22:36 < bridge> <mangomanjo_82539> i need a mod
22:36 < bridge> <mangomanjo_82539> right now
22:36 < bridge> <Solly> #‚úâ-create-a-ticket also wrong channel
22:36 < bridge> <Solly> ^ good luck getting someone to respond in time
22:36 < bridge> <mangomanjo_82539> ok thanks how did you know i was banned
22:37 < bridge> <Solly> ...
22:37 < bridge> <Solly> i didnt
22:37 < bridge> <Solly> i assumed it was a blocker
22:40 < bridge> <oxyzo.> what did you get banned for ? Asking for a friend
22:41 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1345511250234445974/image.png?ex=67c4d080&is=67c37f00&hm=e5198f6e93b9344f4e828929c481929fa9e9dbe44fcceb7767603f7ea9c3a7f0&
22:41 < bridge> <Solly> it appears to work flawlessly
22:41 < bridge> <Solly> so why arent my binds activating
22:42 < bridge> <Solly> ohhh
22:42 < bridge> <Solly> because it was the wrong thing bound
22:42 < bridge> <Solly> it picks the first thing that moved
22:42 < bridge> <Solly> and ignores deadzone
22:43 < bridge> <Solly> why tho surely its just listening for a key event
22:51 < bridge> <mangomanjo_82539> guys thanks for ticket i did it now iam waiting for a response
22:51 < bridge> <mangomanjo_82539> this is my first time being a band guy
22:51 < bridge> <mangomanjo_82539> banned
23:05 < bridge> <kebscs> the way its coded rn, if you have override tune then no matter what tune you are in ill be overriden
23:05 < bridge> <kebscs> idk if i want to change that
23:06 < bridge> <Assa> does this also apply for the new tune override tune itself?
23:06 < bridge> <kebscs> yea i can make so new override tile overrides old one
23:08 < bridge> <Assa> what is overwritten btw? All tunings or just the ones set by the tune zone?
23:08 < bridge> <kebscs> entire tune just like old stuff, so same issue as your global tune
23:09 < bridge> <kebscs> also i made it so unlock tile number 2 can only unlock if you got locked with number 2
23:12 < bridge> <Assa> oh so not a global reset ü§î interesting
23:12 < bridge> <Assa> so you are our new tune zone expert and I am unfortunately the new speedtile expert
23:12 < bridge> <kebscs> :kek:
23:13 < bridge> <Assa> time to break each others code :kek:
23:13 < bridge> <Assa> good thing I removed the speedup tuning xD
23:16 < bridge> <kebscs> ill dilate the entities and i think its ready after a final test
23:18 < bridge> <hectavoxel> i will soon become the automap expert trust me
23:19 < bridge> <kebscs> also projectails work seperately from owner's tune so it doesnt work that well
23:19 < bridge> <kebscs> also projectiles work seperately from owner's tune so it doesnt work that well
23:19 < bridge> <Assa> I already wrote nearly all of the wiki site for it, at least we can help each other @hectavoxel ask me for a review
23:20 < bridge> <Assa> projectiles don't work at all well with tune zones, they don't change the tune zone if they leave it
23:23 < bridge> <Assa> Also is there a reason that @hectavoxel doesn't have the dev tag @robyt3 ? since he is a contributor namely <https://github.com/VoxelDoesCode>
23:29 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe leaving removed all roles
23:31 < bridge> <Solly> @robyt3 `This isn't enough width for some of the labels.`
23:31 < bridge> <Solly> uhmm i like the radio menus, increasing the width of the buttons makes stuff inconsistent, same with newlining it
23:31 < bridge> <Solly> do you have any ideas on what to do ><
23:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> marquee
23:31 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> :D :D
23:31 < bridge> <Solly> NOOO
23:31 < bridge> <Solly> oh yeah you wanted drop down
23:31 < bridge> <robyt3> :pepeW:
23:31 < bridge> <Solly> drop down is bad tho
23:32 < bridge> <Solly> or is less preferable to how it is
23:32 < bridge> <Solly> but its probably the only way
23:32 < bridge> <robyt3> Maybe two checkboxes side by side would have been easier in some cases
23:32 < bridge> <Solly> idk wym by that
23:33 < bridge> <Solly> like split vertically have 2 doline_checkboxbuttons?
23:33 < bridge> <robyt3> For example [X] Hook strength icon [X] Hook strength number
23:33 < bridge> <hectavoxel> im a roleless chad
23:33 < bridge> <hectavoxel> aw
23:33 < bridge> <Solly> lmao
23:34 < bridge> <hectavoxel> lemme look
23:34 < bridge> <Solly> you cant have the number without the icon
23:34 < bridge> <Solly> or actually
23:34 < bridge> <Solly> if that was the case it would make it easier to fit in the way it is now
23:34 < bridge> <robyt3> hide/disable the second checkbox then
23:34 < bridge> <Solly> no, icon, number, both
23:35 < bridge> <robyt3> yeah, two checkboxes encode that easier than 4 buttons
23:35 < bridge> <hectavoxel> which page? speedup or automap?
23:35 < bridge> <Solly> but its so fancy shamncy
23:36 < bridge> <Solly> but okay üòî
23:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Not if the text is already scaled down on default size and in English
23:36 < bridge> <Solly> it wouldnt be if it was just "both"
23:37 < bridge> <robyt3> Then you add another option that nobody asked for?
23:37 < bridge> <robyt3> i.e. showing only the number
23:37 < bridge> <Solly> i think every one of the doohickies was already there or requested
23:38 < bridge> <Solly> but 2 checkboxes it is
23:46 < bridge> <Assa> automap, and now I added your Modulo operator: https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Automapper#Syntax but this belongs in #wiki
23:47 < bridge> <Assa> automap, and now I added your Modulo operator: <https://wiki.ddnet.org/wiki/Automapper#Syntax> but this belongs in #wiki
23:47 < bridge> <Solly> ASHNIDUASD
23:47 < bridge> <Solly> WAIT STOP
23:47 < bridge> <Solly> dont approve it
23:47 < bridge> <Solly> i spend like 10 minutes
23:47 < bridge> <Solly> trying to get it to work
23:47 < bridge> <Solly> but now it does
23:47 < bridge> <Solly> on master
23:48 < bridge> <Solly> oh im an idiot
23:48 < bridge> <Solly> its left and right
23:48 < bridge> <Solly> not up and down
23:48 < bridge> <Solly> do approve it
23:58 < bridge> <robyt3> @sollybunny Thanks for looking into it, it's obviously caused by #9659, you can fix it by changing a single line instead
23:58 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9659
23:59 < bridge> <robyt3> > Reorder the joystick hat keys so the order is consistent with the mouse wheel directions. :justatest:
23:59 < bridge> <Solly> oops
23:59 < bridge> <robyt3> The upper bound of the for loops did not include left and right hat keys anymore
23:59 < bridge> <Solly> its never worked for me
