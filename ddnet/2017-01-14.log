15:08 < Hamid_Jigool> hello
15:08 < Hamid_Jigool> im searching for help
15:08 < Hamid_Jigool> Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO) in mariadb
15:09 < Hamid_Jigool> on ubuntu
15:09 < Hamid_Jigool> Server_sql DDnet not connect to database
15:15 <@EastByte> iirc that a problem has to do with the static sql lib in the ddnet repo
15:16 < Hamid_Jigool> so what can i do?
15:18 <@EastByte> I guess you need to force bam to use the sql lib provided by your package manager
15:19 < Hamid_Jigool> do you know what commands should i use for that?
15:20 <@EastByte> I'm afraid not, would require some digging in
15:21 <@EastByte> but atleast one person here has done it before
15:21 < Hamid_Jigool> who?
15:24 <@EastByte> dunno, deen probably

18:15 <@deen> Install the mysql/mariadb libs, rm config.lua, bam server_sql_release, check the output to see if the correct lib is used

21:25 < necropotame> deen, EastByte, any interest for my implementation of text rendering? It's faster and takes less memory. And it support glyph search in multiple fonts. A comparison of both glyph cache here: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=119110#p119110
