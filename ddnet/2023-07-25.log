00:24 < bridge_> <astramast> 2 ideas :
00:24 < bridge_> <astramast> 1 - Add a search bar in the Players Tab
00:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what's your use case for this?
00:26 < bridge_> <astramast> 2 - Add a queue system for full servers : When server full and someone attempt to connect, he gets a number, that number gets +1. When someone disconnects server sends a ping back to all ppl that tried to connect. If they still are trying to connect, n¬∞1 gets connected, the others get their number -1. If someone is no longer trying to connect, -1 to all the next ones
00:26 < bridge_> <astramast> something like this idk
00:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> this has an open issue: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/3453#issuecomment-1638880126
00:27 < bridge_> <astramast> something like this idk maybe the method i described make servers burn
00:27 < bridge_> <astramast> theres 64 players in the Players tab i'm searching for a specific one i know his name
00:27 < bridge_> <astramast> like... it's a Search bar
00:27 < bridge_> <astramast> why do we have a search bar for servers
00:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> why wouldn't we??
00:28 < bridge_> <Ewan> "let's go fng" -> types fng -> wins
00:28 < bridge_> <astramast> we could even have the same system as in server browser, where u could sort players by muted, emote muted, or friends
00:28 < bridge_> <astramast> exactly
00:28 < bridge_> <astramast> so lets get it for Players tab too :D
00:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because it takes time to implement and might clutter the UI if we don't need it
00:29 < bridge_> <Ewan> why? you can search a player name in the server searchbar
00:30 < bridge_> <astramast> won't clutter
00:30 < bridge_> <astramast> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1133164363797233795/image.png
00:30 < bridge_> <astramast> to mute rapidly
00:31 < bridge_> <astramast> do we have  a /mute cmd btw ?
00:31 < bridge_> <Ewan> f1 mute
00:31 < bridge_> <astramast> ah ok ok
00:31 < bridge_> <astramast> Idea 3 : Add a /mute <Player> cmd. Unmute if the player is already muted
00:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> why
00:32 < bridge_> <Ewan> f1 mute
00:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> since it's client-side, it has to be in the console
00:32 < bridge_> <astramast> understandable
00:32 < bridge_> <astramast> ~~Idea 3 : Add a /mute <Player> cmd. Unmute if the player is already muted~~
00:34 < bridge_> <learath2> Or we can make the ugliest hack known to mankind. Intercept slash commands on the client :BigBrain:
00:34 < bridge_> <Ewan> seems pointless
00:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I did not dare say this out loud
00:35 < bridge_> <learath2> It is very very pointless
00:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not entirely
00:35 < bridge_> <learath2> Slightly easier to use?
00:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> how does the mute command work in the console? we don't complete player names in the local console yet, do we?
00:36 < bridge_> <learath2> Nope, we don't complete them anywhere
00:36 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we complete them in chat
00:36 < bridge_> <learath2> Ah, yep that would help

00:39 < bridge_> <learath2> Our text renderer iirc can't handle this
00:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I got a file with this filename
00:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I wanted to see whether it's some fancy emoji
00:40 < bridge_> <Ewan> hm
00:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but I don't see it
00:40 < bridge_> <learath2> I wonder if it's a different encoding
00:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it was xml-escaped in the file name
00:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I guess it's not
00:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the original filename was `&#1087;&#1080;&#1082;&#1085;&#1080;&#1082;-0003`

10:01 < bridge_> <Ewan> most ppl don't use this feature
10:51 < bridge_> <Ewan> does the tele pred pr have pred for kill tiles too?
11:25 < bridge_> <totar> no
11:27 < bridge_> <totar> I think respawn tiles put you the furthest away from the nearest tee, but if you don't have /Showall then I don't think the client can know which respawn tile the server will pick

11:35 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xorg wins over wayland
11:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the x.org maintainers went to wayland IIRC
11:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is vsync still forced?
11:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ddg'ing "vsync forced wayland" leads me to https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/lscc3v/ (RIP reddit) which leads me to the following merged pull request: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/65
11:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes
11:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The prs for the drivers are still open
11:42 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nori will notify us when they in üòÇ
11:43 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì since its gitlab its a MR not a PR
11:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> xd
11:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> just call the concept whatever you want
11:47 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye its a joke
11:48 < bridge_> <ryozuki> how well does ddnet work in wayland
11:49 < bridge_> <ryozuki> does the xwayland bridge have forced vsync too?
11:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> my quick ddg search yields no results
11:55 < bridge_> <robyt3> @heinrich5991 Do you mean I should remove the entire commit adding `IO_NEWLINE` or just always use `\n` for the JSON writer? Should I add another constant `#define JSON_NEWLINE "\n"` then or use the literal `"\n"` everywhere in the tests? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6874#pullrequestreview-1544214616
11:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I guess removing the entire commit with `IO_NEWLINE` would be good. don't add another constant for `JSON_NEWLINE`, but directly use `\n` everywhere
11:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what do you think about that? @robyt3
11:59 < bridge_> <robyt3> Seems okay, I just added `IO_NEWLINE` to avoid the duplicate testing code, but only using `\n` also works

16:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
16:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > This technique is CVE-2023-20593 and it works on all Zen 2 class processors, which includes at least the following products:

16:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> noooo
16:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> u beat me to it this time
16:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
16:24 < bridge_> <ryozuki> somehow i missed it lol
16:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But u didn't tag me to force me read the news xdd
16:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xdd
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cvtsi2sd
16:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So if it's fixed in newer ryzens. Did they know about it?
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> man assembly instructions rly got some names
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xdd
16:26 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I payed 250‚Ç¨ for my 16 cores lmao
16:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> is 7020 new?
16:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's only fixed if you updated your microcode since essentially yesterday
16:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That's graphics
16:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I mean newer hardware
16:27 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> It didn't mention Ryzen 7000 series
16:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @chairn this probs also interests u
16:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @chairn indeed. That's why u have to buy newest hardware
16:28 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Don't do the same mistake as me
16:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> is it even fixed in the latest hardware?
16:28 < bridge_> <chairn> i've seen it already
16:29 < bridge_> <chairn> saw a poster abut that kind of optimization with intel chips on november, leading to the same data leak
16:29 < bridge_> <chairn> last hardware is probably even worse
16:29 < bridge_> <chairn> they keep introducing new vulnerabilities üòÑ
16:29 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @chairn if I buy u a modern gaming PC. Would u use it?
16:30 < bridge_> <chairn> no
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So u intentionally use slow hardware?
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Gaming laptop
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> As alt
16:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rly?
16:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> compiling ddnet in 20 secs is nice
16:30 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> In 6 even nicer
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> on release
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> can u compile it in 6? xd
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i should try compiling ddnet on a tmpfs too
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe it speeds up
16:31 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Haven't tried lately. But the 16 core upgrade boosted it again xd
16:31 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
16:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks @heinrich5991 btw im interested in this, do you introduce extensive testing on ur ddnet rust projects? property testing?
16:32 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i rly wonder if game dev big houses do some kind of automated testing on gameplay
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> specially for games with precise physics
16:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm leaning a bit on libtw2 for reimplementing the teeworlds 0.6 protocol. that has lots of testing and also quickcheck-like testing
16:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> probably not
16:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> we could do that with @zwelf2's teehistorian replayer at some point üôÇ
16:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> that would be kind of like differential testing?
16:34 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I introduced testing for network mostly. Else only smaller tests for either how I want to use libs or libs I introduced

16:54 < ChillerDragon> eww
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Free protein

16:55 < ChillerDragon> jopsti face reveal
16:55 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Froggers
16:55 < bridge_> <gerdoe> jfroggers
16:55 < ChillerDragon> xd
17:05 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks do u eat eggs
17:06 < ChillerDragon> thats not vegan...
17:06 < ChillerDragon> ryo trol
17:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm not sure in what context you mean it. But always no xd
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wanted to know if u vegetarian instead
17:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> xd
17:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I didn't like eggs ever anyway xD
17:08 < ChillerDragon> eggs s good what can i say
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Nowadays it's not even hard to be vegan xd. One trillion alternatives.
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 10 years ago it was much harder xd
17:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Thanks hipster kids xd
17:12 < ChillerDragon> omagawd @heinrich5991 can we discuss redirects?
17:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sure
17:12 < ChillerDragon> pog
17:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @kaffeine0
17:13 < ChillerDragon> why u insisting on dropping the connection?
17:13 < ChillerDragon> ok whatever i dont care my client will be up to date i will be redirected
17:13 < ChillerDragon> if it bothers me on my server i can change the code
17:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> correct
17:13 < ChillerDragon> ok then if it has to happen how?
17:14 < ChillerDragon> how do i ensure the client is not dropped before it got the redirect message?
17:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> check if the client is too old
17:14 < ChillerDragon> no i mean 
17:14 < ChillerDragon> if its recent enough
17:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if so, drop the client right after sending the (flushed) redirect message
17:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if it's recent enogh
17:14 < ChillerDragon> so flushing it and then dropping
17:14 < ChillerDragon> thats all the gurantee there is?
17:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> send the redirect message and wait for the client to drop the connection
17:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if the client sends further messages, ignore them completely
17:15 < ChillerDragon> so drop the connection after a timeout?
17:15 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'd be fine without the timeout
17:16 < ChillerDragon> will it?
17:16 < ChillerDragon> its udp after all
17:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's the same as normal disconnects then
17:16 < ChillerDragon> you mean kicks?
17:17 < ws-client> <Jupstar> chillerdragon: it sounds like what you want to ask is: are disconnects vital
17:17 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/28
17:17 < ChillerDragon> this doesnt even work on local server
17:17 < ChillerDragon> it just kicks me
17:17 < ChillerDragon> i cant imagine what happens on a laggy unstable connection
17:18 < ChillerDragon> i just do not want to drop clients that did not get the info where to redirect to
17:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> make em vital?
17:18 < ChillerDragon> doesnt help
17:18 < ChillerDragon> if the client is dropped
17:18 < ChillerDragon> vital wont be resend
17:18 < ChillerDragon> will it?
17:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's why I say the server doesn't drop the client if it's recent enough(?)
17:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> read above
17:19 < ChillerDragon> thats not what i talk about
17:19 < ChillerDragon> i talk about packet loss
17:19 < ChillerDragon> for recent clients
17:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
17:19 < ws-client> <Jupstar> lmao
17:19 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i think u both missunderstand each other
17:19 < ChillerDragon> me too?
17:19 < ws-client> <Jupstar> chiller: dont disconnect at all
17:19 < ChillerDragon> omagwd
17:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm saying with the above solution, there's no problem
17:19 < ws-client> <Jupstar> if client is new
17:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the client disconnects
17:20 < ChillerDragon> o
17:20 < ChillerDragon> only disconnect old`?
17:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
17:20 < ChillerDragon> why do you even want to drop it in the first place then?
17:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> thanks Jupstar
17:21 < ChillerDragon> yes jupsti pro
17:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because old clients won't disconnect automatically
17:21 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I want the protocol to work similarly for old and new clients
17:22 < ChillerDragon> okay
17:22 < ws-client> <Jupstar> chillerdragon: sneak a Kick("Update client") in ;)
17:22 < ChillerDragon> i see so kick is backwards compability i like it
17:22 < ChillerDragon> gonna use the same in my 0.7 pr
17:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, the kick is backcompat
17:22 < ChillerDragon> kick those 0.6 clients
17:22 < ChillerDragon> axaxaxa
17:23 < ChillerDragon> ok nvm the code snippet i sent would even redirect on localhost i was just using an old client :D 
17:24 < ChillerDragon> so and waddup the cookies now?
17:24 < ChillerDragon> opaque id?
17:24 < ChillerDragon> DHL tracking number
17:24 < ChillerDragon> and password
17:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> are you interested in implementing it?
17:24 < ChillerDragon> i want cookies!
17:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't feel like it's absolutely necessary tbh
17:25 < ChillerDragon> but cookies should be unrelated to redirect
17:25 < ChillerDragon> they should be sent on any connect regardless of redirect
17:25 < ChillerDragon> what i want is redirecting to other ips ._.
17:25 < ChillerDragon> to send jopsti to russia
17:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> why do you want to redirect to other IPs?
17:26 < ChillerDragon> if i switch hoster for example
17:27 < ChillerDragon> or load balance tees around on a multi server cluster
17:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that seems out of reach tbh
17:27 < ChillerDragon> heck redirecting to url would even better
17:27 < ChillerDragon> to enforce 0.7 connection for all hehe
17:27 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 out of wat
17:27 < ChillerDragon> how?
17:28 < ChillerDragon> i dont get the security risk
17:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> load-balancing tees
17:28 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> multiserver cluster
17:28 < ChillerDragon> seems like a useless limitation
17:28 < ChillerDragon> on servers that require less state or where state can be sent across network that is totally reachable
17:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> one of the things that just came to my mind regarding 'security', I think the target server should probably communicate that it wants to receive the new clients
17:29 < ChillerDragon> i mean using CSaveTee you can basically send player state over the network and sync across servers
17:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> one of the things that just came to my mind regarding 'security', I think the target server should probably communicate that it wants to receive redirects from that address
17:29 < ChillerDragon> cross origin policy
17:29 < ws-client> <Jupstar> xD
17:30 < ChillerDragon> do you want to load tees from that url?
17:30 < ws-client> <Jupstar> i dont want to be redirected to teep*rn.com 
17:30 < ChillerDragon> you have no rights
17:30 < ChillerDragon> pst
17:30 < ChillerDragon> then do not connect to chillertrap.com in the first place
17:30 < ChillerDragon> its known associate
17:31 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i see to avoid some kind of unwanted flood to servers that dont want any visitors
17:31 < ws-client> <Jupstar> what i dislike is that i might be redicrected to a different country
17:31 < ChillerDragon> such as area51.nsa.gov
17:31 < ChillerDragon> you can possibly get users in legal trouble
17:31 < ChillerDragon> if you make them send udp packets
17:31 < ChillerDragon> to blacklisted ips
17:32 < ChillerDragon> phew idk how to solve that
17:33 < ChillerDragon> thats why i gotta just slap my whole network behind a proxy that is one unfied ip and routes all traffic under the hood to wherever i want @heinrich5991 rip your proxy support
17:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> do you run more than one server atm?
17:33 < ChillerDragon> ok no redirect to custom ips for now
17:34 < ChillerDragon> i dream big and act little
17:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> cookies?
17:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> chiller implementing a tee browser
17:34 < ChillerDragon> but i had two 2vps connected to one teeworlds kubernetes cluster for 1 day xd
17:34 < ChillerDragon> cookies pog
17:34 < ChillerDragon> for tee tracking
17:34 < ChillerDragon> and auto login
17:34 < ChillerDragon> and facebook ads
17:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> "cookies" will come with accounts anyway
17:35 < ChillerDragon> generically usable for 3rd parties?
17:35 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ye
17:35 < ChillerDragon> pls no GDPR popups on connecting to servers
17:35 < ChillerDragon> THIS SERVER USES COOKIES!
17:36 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you do know that this is only related to cookies not necessary for the service's operation
17:36 < ChillerDragon> ok amazing so jopsti will code cookie feature for me
17:36 < ChillerDragon> i know nothing
17:36 < ChillerDragon> thats what i have lawyer jopsti for
17:37 < ChillerDragon> he covers all my legal concerns
17:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> chiller legit has a company of unpaid employees, all from this chat
17:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> im his google
17:37 < ChillerDragon> xd
17:37 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i want my teecoins
17:37 < ChillerDragon> *sends some teecoins*
17:45 < ChillerDragon> jopsti do u know how to hac opengl?
17:45 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/Es
17:46 < ChillerDragon> i did arch update after decades of procrastination
17:46 < ChillerDragon> and am too lazy to reboot
17:47 < ChillerDragon> ok watever i reboot xd
17:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> just reboot
17:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> kill xserver xd
17:50 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> doesn't work
17:50 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> driver/library mismatch
17:50 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon: speaking of laziness. Would you rather update a cert, or learn the public key fingerprint by heart xd
17:50 < ChillerDragon> fair point
17:50 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> context? ^^
17:51 < ChillerDragon> context is the hotfix is harder than the fix
17:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> a cert today expired, apparently certbot was down for some reason. but i wasnt at my computer, so i just copied the fingerprint and checked it later, in good faith that i'm currently not attacked xdd
17:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> now that i learned it, i dont need to even start certbot anymore
17:53 < ChillerDragon> xd
17:53 < bridge_> <learath2> Yet another bizarro chiller use üòÑ
17:54 < bridge_> <learath2> When request ip over avian carrier support for ddnet?
17:55 < ChillerDragon> omagawd lerato
17:55 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ur biggest fan
17:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> waste 64*8 bytes for each big snap?
17:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> probably a bit much
17:57 < ChillerDragon> is this a reply?
17:57 < ChillerDragon> who wastes bytes?
17:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm writing the dissector
17:58 < ChillerDragon> ?
17:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> there is no reply
17:58 < ChillerDragon> ou you do snap dissecting? o.O
17:58 < ChillerDragon> very pog
17:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I was considering to waste 64*8 bytes for each snap spanning at least two messages
17:58 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> currently only snap reassembly
17:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> not dissecting the actual snaps
17:59 < ChillerDragon> so the snap it self isnt wasting
17:59 < ChillerDragon> your implementation is?
17:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I was considering an implementation that's a bit more wasteful
17:59 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but I decided to do it another way
17:59 < ChillerDragon> just tell your users to buy more ram
18:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm a user
18:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> can't buy more ram for this machine
18:00 < ChillerDragon> why not?
18:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> soldered
18:00 < ChillerDragon> your laptop?
18:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
18:00 < ChillerDragon> hm
18:01 < ChillerDragon> just add a new section on ddnet.org/donations
18:01 < ChillerDragon> development hardware
18:01 < ChillerDragon> and buy new laptop
18:01 < ChillerDragon> im half kidding
18:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> should be full kidding
18:02 < ChillerDragon> ok i kicked clients wiht current or older version in #6914 idk if thats the way to be back compat
18:02 < chillerbot> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/6914
18:03 < ChillerDragon> all other version checks seem to predict the new release number already
18:04 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> please don't start a new standard ^^
18:04 < ChillerDragon> ok then explain the old
18:04 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> predict the next version number :p
18:04 < ChillerDragon> rly?
18:05 < ChillerDragon> is that how its done?
18:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> 17.2
18:05 < ChillerDragon> lmao
18:05 < bridge_> <learath2> According to the law of jupsti you should just get an entire new machine in that case
18:05 < ChillerDragon> agree
18:05 < ChillerDragon> jopsti law good
18:05 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> sounds bad for the environment
18:06 < ChillerDragon> omg vegan heinrich be like
18:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> just buy a new environment üòâ
18:06 < ChillerDragon> yes!
18:06 < bridge_> <learath2> But it's great for streamlining development. Only target the very bleeding edge and infinite ram/storage/network bitrate
18:06 < ChillerDragon> just turn your old laptop into a server and keep using it
18:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: the impl of the thing should probbaly go into the engine
18:06 < ChillerDragon> the server side?
18:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
18:06 < ChillerDragon> instead of gamecontext?
18:06 < ChillerDragon> u say that now?
18:06 < ChillerDragon> after hours of engineering
18:06 < ChillerDragon> omahgawd
18:06 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> üòÑ
18:06 < ChillerDragon> oke
18:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's a system message after all
18:07 < ChillerDragon> ok mr protocol designer
18:07 < bridge_> <learath2> Just unengineer it and you'll get your time back
18:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and you also need the engine to ignore all further messages from a client
18:07 < ChillerDragon> this is exhausting
18:07 < ChillerDragon> whats that supposed to mean
18:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> above `int GameFlags = 0;`, check whether the client was redirected already and ignore the packet in that case
18:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> in src/engine/server/server.cpp
18:10 < ChillerDragon> so also for new clients?
18:10 < ChillerDragon> i thought only kick old clients?
18:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> only needed for new clients
18:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
18:10 < ChillerDragon> omg 
18:10 < ChillerDragon> we going circles
18:11 < ChillerDragon> is this really needed?
18:11 < ChillerDragon> and for what?
18:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> old clients: send redirect message, kick.
18:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> new clients: send redirect message, ignore further messages from the client.
18:11 < ChillerDragon> why ignore from new clients
18:11 < ChillerDragon> and for how long?
18:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> forever
18:11 < ChillerDragon> so lifeban all redirected clients?
18:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> lifeban?
18:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> only ignore messages on that connection
18:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> they can disconnect and reconnect immediately if they want to
18:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but they can't continue using that connection
18:12 < ChillerDragon> how does one even identify a connection
18:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> client ID?
18:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you have a client struct
18:12 < ChillerDragon> isnt that reused
18:12 < ChillerDragon> so i add a bool in the struct?
18:12 < ChillerDragon> hmkay
18:12 < ChillerDragon> bloat imo
18:12 < ChillerDragon> but whatever
18:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> checking for correct utf-8 is probably also "bloat" in your opinion? ^^
18:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that has led to some wonderful exploits, even some in TW ^^
18:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the idea is that you specify your protocol very precisely
18:14 < ChillerDragon> you should push spec driven development
18:14 < ChillerDragon> writing a teeworlds protocol standard first and discussing that
18:14 < ChillerDragon> and then the implementation
18:15 < ChillerDragon> for a 2d kirby shooter
18:15 < ChillerDragon> axaxaxax
18:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the 2d kirby shooter that's casually DoSed
18:16 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> probably needs some consideration for protocols
18:23 < ChillerDragon> what is the difference between kick and dropping traffic?
18:24 < ChillerDragon> im thinking about calling ``DelClientCallback`` instead of bloating in a new ignore message concept
18:24 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> arent u the one that wrote the doc for whole protocol xd
18:24 < ChillerDragon> yes!
18:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the thing you also wanted to have. re-delivery of the redirect message
18:24 < ChillerDragon> yes!
18:24 < ChillerDragon> dont you think that makes sense?
18:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
18:25 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon will be the first to add a client that can ignore redirects xdd
18:25 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's the answer to "what's the difference between kick and dropping traffic"
18:25 < ChillerDragon> axaxax jopsti tru
18:25 < ChillerDragon> i see
18:36 < ChillerDragon> interesting dropping there just gets my client stuck
18:36 < ChillerDragon> no connection problems
18:36 < ChillerDragon> i guess the server still sends keepalive lemme check
18:37 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/Ep
18:37 < ChillerDragon> hmm
18:37 < ChillerDragon> is this dropped enough for you @heinrich5991 ?
18:37 < ChillerDragon> it seems super bugged 
18:38 < bridge_> <Iza> do you guys think ddnet is a good start to a novice programmer?
18:38 < ChillerDragon> i really dont wanna see some clients end up in that state seems like a debugging nightmare
18:38 < ChillerDragon> i started with ddnet and i turned out great
18:38 < ChillerDragon> or did i
18:39 < ChillerDragon> @Iza c++ has more pitfalls and annoyances for beginners than python or other high level scripting languages
18:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> if u code for yourself its probably ez to get some stuff working without lot of effort
18:39 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> but honestly the codebase isnt really built for intuitivity
18:39 < ChillerDragon> getting it to compile is 70% already
18:40 < bridge_> <Iza> Yeah i heard python is great for beginners, but c++ is just more useful for more stuff, isnt it?
18:40 < ChillerDragon> depends
18:40 < ChillerDragon> why do you want to code anyways
18:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i mean generally: if u start coding with small games.. u directly see (visually) what you did.. that's quite nice
18:40 < bridge_> <learath2> It'll make you a decent programmer though, if you manage to understand ddnet you are pretty decent üòÑ
18:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> python is never great lmao
18:40 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it's like purposely going into hell
18:40 < ChillerDragon> pygame pog
18:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, I don't think c++ is useful for more stuff than python
18:40 < ChillerDragon> idk actually never tried it
18:41 < bridge_> <Iza> I thought I may can learn something that‚Äôs going to be useful for my future
18:41 < bridge_> <Iza> Or rather the future of jobs
18:41 < ChillerDragon> what do you want to do in your future?
18:41 < bridge_> <avolicious> client or server-side? xD
18:41 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> python is actually used quite a lot in ML, e.g.
18:41 < ChillerDragon> there wont be jobs in the future?
18:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon: omg good opinion
18:41 < ChillerDragon> @avolicious xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXD
18:41 < bridge_> <learath2> The more of it you understand the better
18:41 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> future human
18:41 < ChillerDragon> Iza yes you can also write client side hacks with python
18:42 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but the most important thing is to work on something that you actually want to work on. if that's ddnet, that's great üôÇ
18:42 < bridge_> <Iza> Yes that‚Äôs what I thought so too
18:42 < ChillerDragon> heinrich stop ghost me
18:42 < bridge_> <learath2> If you want to get some useful skill but you dont intend to become a programmer, python is a good idea. Business people ajd academy people LOVE python
18:43 < bridge_> <Iza> I'd love to add/change some features in ddnet that otherwise probably won‚Äôt ever exist
18:43 < bridge_> <learath2> Data scientists would sacrifice their firstborns to Guido Van Rossum
18:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I'm not sure where you get the impression that python is not a real programming language
18:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> python is used in real-world code bases
18:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @learath2 good opinion
18:43 < bridge_> <learath2> Python is english with some extra formatting rules and you can't fool me
18:43 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf is python
18:44 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> in fact, most of today's glue code is probably written in python
18:44 < bridge_> <Iza> If I start learning python I might as well create a discord bot
18:44 < bridge_> <learath2> Don't remind me, it gives me nightmares
18:44 < ChillerDragon> @Iza if you like ddnet and want to add features please go for it can highly recommend. if you just want to get a job you can look into your nearby job market which is probably not offering any c++ junior positions
18:44 < bridge_> <avolicious> Job offers are mostly Java, Python, C#
18:45 < bridge_> <avolicious> Java EE
18:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> thanks @avolicious
18:45 < bridge_> <learath2> But my main point wasn't this anyway, but that even if you don't do programming python is still useful
18:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I was pretty sure that python was actually used
18:45 < bridge_> <Iza> Learning programming just to get a job sounds like something that you‚Äôll regret tbh
18:45 < ChillerDragon> my company is full of python
18:45 < bridge_> <avolicious> It is indeed. Mostly data science, but also used in other topics
18:45 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ah, I see. I read the other thing between the lines
18:46 < bridge_> <learath2> Understandable, my distaste of python is well known
18:46 < bridge_> <avolicious> https://jupyter.org/
18:46 < ChillerDragon> lerato hates all programming languages dont listen to him
18:47 < bridge_> <avolicious> Python is very straight forward, thats why it is being used so often in data science
18:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> @avolicious I think JS/TS is missing from that list
18:47 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 i am still connected after ignoring a redirect ^^
18:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> python is the slowest language ever. in order to speed it up they write c libraries and bind it to python xDD
18:47 < ChillerDragon> mojo
18:47 < bridge_> <Iza> What is slow about it?
18:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, that's the idea behind python. you write high-level code there
18:47 < bridge_> <avolicious> Yeah, but I thought we are talking about backend enterprise solutions. JS/TS is like PHP üòÑ Used as webdev
18:47 < bridge_> <learath2> This, I'm the programmer, modern languages and higher level languages make me feel more like a drone
18:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I thought people also use JS/TS with node in the backend
18:47 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> log4j xdd
18:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> log4j is a java library AFAIK
18:48 < ChillerDragon> yes
18:48 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah
18:48 < bridge_> <learath2> I have a feeling this might not be the original intention but just a result of the fact that python has awful performance
18:48 < bridge_> <avolicious> https://github.com/python/cpython isnt that slow
18:48 < ChillerDragon> blazingly python
18:48 < bridge_> <Iza> Wait until you see chatgpt assisted programmers
18:48 < ChillerDragon> wait?
18:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think it was meant to replace perl, which was in a similar position
18:48 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but maybe
18:49 < bridge_> <avolicious> Ah, true that. NodeJS is also a thing, totally forgotten, sorry.
18:49 < ChillerDragon> and perl was meant to replace bash
18:49 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well going from slowest to not the slowest is probs not hard xdd
18:49 < bridge_> <learath2> This is more along the lines of what I've heard. A perl replacement with better syntax
18:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but perl was also mostly glue code, no?
18:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that's the default interpreter btw. if you want fast execution, you can use pypy3
18:49 < bridge_> <avolicious> And nagios monitoring xD
18:50 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I used that when I needed speed for AoC @jupeyy_keks
18:50 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/fstd/pstd
18:50 < ChillerDragon> perl pog
18:50 < bridge_> <learath2> I'm not exactly clear on the hiatory but what Chiller said is what I remember. Perl was supposed to be a more capable shell
18:50 < ChillerDragon> clearly drunks who decided shell is not perfect
18:51 < bridge_> <avolicious> Perl is the most hated programming language (https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/31/disliked-programming-languages/)
18:51 < bridge_> <avolicious> Perl is the most hated programming language (https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/31/disliked-programming-languages/)

18:51 < bridge_> <avolicious> Perl is the most hated programming language (https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/31/disliked-programming-languages/)
18:51 < bridge_> <avolicious> 
18:51 < bridge_> <avolicious> Its from 2017
18:51 < ChillerDragon> people participating in the survey havent tried C#
18:51 < bridge_> <learath2> I don't know if it was always intended to be glue though, it wasn't all that common to have almost everything being written in compiled languages called from python
18:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> they did
18:51 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> see the diagram
18:51 < ChillerDragon> shit
18:52 < bridge_> <avolicious> C# is enterprise üôÇ
18:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> C# is a fine language
18:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> from what I could observe
18:52 < ChillerDragon> woah heinrich
18:52 < ChillerDragon> is there any language you think is not fine?
18:52 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's basically a better java
18:52 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/python3-gpp.html
18:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't like reading/writing perl
18:53 < bridge_> <learath2> No, heinrich loves all languages
18:53 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> PYSON
18:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but that might just be my missing experience
18:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't like huge bash scripts
18:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I prefer to see them replaced with python, e.g.
18:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't like M4
18:53 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> or autotools
18:54 < bridge_> <learath2> I don't think anyone likes m4 üòÑ
18:54 < ChillerDragon> i do
18:54 < bridge_> <avolicious> Ayayay https://github.com/numba/numba
18:54 < ChillerDragon> ./configure
18:54 < ChillerDragon> pog
18:54 < bridge_> <learath2> When you start having to do stuff like this, maybe your language is just not good for this use you are forcing on it
18:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> pypy3 should be fine, no?
18:55 < bridge_> <learath2> Pypy does jit, right?
18:55 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes
18:55 < bridge_> <avolicious> No, dont think so. It heavily depends on your use-case. Python is used in ML/data science a lot, so there are a lot of projects focusing on acceleration like numba
18:56 < bridge_> <learath2> Your reasoning is the opposite of the basis of my argument. I'm saying maybe Python isn't all that good for ML/data science
18:57 < bridge_> <avolicious> What would you recommend instead?
18:57 < bridge_> <avolicious> Due to python simplicity, it allows non-programmers to work in ML/data science
18:58 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ML happens on the GPU mostly tho
18:58 < bridge_> <avolicious> Yep, but you need someone who creates a model, works with data and so on
18:59 < bridge_> <nuborn> Yes, the actual ML happens in cuda/cudnn
18:59 < bridge_> <avolicious> High-level languages do at some point a lot of tasks for you, without noticing it
18:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh no i missed the python bashing with perla
18:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> oh no i missed the python bashing with perls
18:59 < bridge_> <learath2> I'm only saying you can make a better language more suited for it.
18:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @ryozuki just in time
18:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> JIT
18:59 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> üò¨
18:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> kek
18:59 < bridge_> <learath2> Julia is interesting and is JIT compiled out of the box
18:59 < bridge_> <ryozuki> rust
19:00 < bridge_> <learath2> R is interpreted and is much much more convenient to use for data science
19:00 < bridge_> <avolicious> Yeah, was going to say that üòÑ
19:00 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> julia has telemetry by default üòÆ
19:00 < bridge_> <avolicious> Too heavy for simple tasks
19:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Actually and u dont have to trust me, but the future of ML lies in something called MLIR in the llvm project. Multi level Intermediate Representstion
19:01 < bridge_> <ryozuki> MOJO will prove it
19:01 < bridge_> <learath2> MATLAB is proprietary horseshit but it runs circles around python for performance iirc
19:01 < bridge_> <avolicious> I am not saying that Rust is bad, but for most of the data science people, its overload
19:02 < bridge_> <learath2> Has much better tooling too, very standardized in a lot of industries
19:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://mlir.llvm.org/
19:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://docs.modular.com/mojo/notebooks/BoolMLIR.html
19:02 < bridge_> <nuborn> Mojo seems like an interesting language if it ever gets created, since Python users might adopt it (compiled Python). Unfortunately, not too many uses julia
19:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> you know who is behind mojo?
19:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> @nuborn r u data scientist? xd
19:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> its not about if, its about when
19:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> would kinda fit, since u like math
19:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> and coding
19:03 < ChillerDragon> i like meth and codeine
19:03 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> xd
19:03 < bridge_> <ryozuki> Chris Lattner, creator of llvm and swift is behind mojo
19:04 < bridge_> <nuborn> I use Matlab for work xD would prefer Julia though. More DSP/statistics though, but kind of that area
19:04 < bridge_> <learath2> > Based on python
19:04 < bridge_> <learath2> üö©
19:04 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki fan
19:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Christopher Arthur Lattner (born 1978) is an American computer scientist, former Google and Tesla employee[1] and co-founder of LLVM, Clang compiler, MLIR compiler infrastructure[2] and the Swift programming language. As of 2023, he is the co-founder and CEO of Modular AI, an artificial intelligence platform for developers.[3][4] Before founding Modular AI, he worked as the President of Platform Engineering, SiFive[5][6][7] after two years at Go
19:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> the guy is a beast
19:04 < bridge_> <nuborn> Llvm creator iirc?
19:04 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye
19:05 < bridge_> <nuborn> Yes
19:05 < bridge_> <nuborn> If not for that I would just think it was pure hype
19:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ye i dislike that part, but it lets u use low level IR (MLIR) which with its dialects, bridges a lot of different hardware/frameworks
19:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think they chose python cuz ML is all python
19:06 < bridge_> <learath2> Python will be with us for a century because every field decided to use it üò≠
19:06 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but it doesnt have GIL and is allegedly faster
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> just deny it's existince. it's easier for your health
19:07 < bridge_> <learath2> The invention of python is like a permanent technical debt that we'll have to carry
19:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1133445358740045865/Screenshot_2023-07-25-19-07-01-311_org.mozilla.firefox.jpg
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> from their website?
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> trust me bro
19:07 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> "scalar c++"
19:07 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i trust the llvm creator
19:07 < bridge_> <learath2> Another one of these is Electron. Another piece of permanent technical debt
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> XD but wasm is in comming
19:07 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so there is hope
19:08 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> how does wasm help?
19:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> MLIR is like the wasm of ML targets
19:08 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> well u can kick out js
19:08 < bridge_> <learath2> Faster than js+jit powering electron
19:08 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wasm is awesome if it makes js disappear
19:09 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> JS will be with us forever
19:09 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i also dont understand why devs keep making libraries with js instead of ts and not having types
19:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> most ppl code in typescript tho
19:09 < bridge_> <Voxel> so is mojo just python but better
19:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so a language like:
19:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://www.assemblyscript.org/
19:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
19:09 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> which is close to typescript might be easy to adopt
19:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i wouldnt call it python, it has a python like design, but under the hood its way lower level
19:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> [citation needed]
19:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and even if, TS has JS as compilation target
19:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> not on deno
19:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> no, that's too close to assembly, I think
19:10 < bridge_> <ryozuki> deno runs ts without transpiling
19:10 < bridge_> <learath2> Though I'm unsure how much of js electron code would be translated into wasm.
19:10 < bridge_> <learath2> 
19:10 < bridge_> <learath2> Electron is used so much because it's js and can be used by web devs
19:10 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> link?
19:10 < bridge_> <learath2> Economically gr8
19:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> how that? lmao
19:10 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> they even say its meant to be typescript similar
19:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes. but it's very close to wasm itself
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> @heinrich5991  https://deno.land/
19:11 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1133446440040022026/Screenshot_2023-07-25-19-11-07-546_org.mozilla.firefox.jpg
19:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's kind of like a macro assembler for x86
19:11 < bridge_> <learath2> No types is what modern coders seem to be more used to. I've been having more and more trouble explaining types to people
19:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I doubt V8 can execute TS. so it's still transpiling to JS
19:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i find it insane, i feel lost without types, u need to check a million things to make exception safe stuff
19:12 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk, maybe its not js but a IR
19:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I doubt it, but you made the claim that deno isn't compiling to JS ^^
19:13 < bridge_> <learath2> If it's just using V8 internally it most definitely is using JS
19:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> in fact (with a little exception), typescript executes fine as JS if you just strip all the types
19:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and they want to get rid of that exception IIRC
19:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> wasnt fortran the most famous lang
19:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it is not used
19:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> same will happen
19:14 < bridge_> <ryozuki> :justatest:
19:14 < bridge_> <learath2> Yep, it just avoids babel. It has it's own typescript transpiler built in
19:14 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> FORTRAN is used in numpy
19:16 < bridge_> <learath2> Iirc a lot of assembly aswell
19:16 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> dunno, looks like typescript but with i32 instead of number xd
19:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> well assembly quite likely will stay
19:17 < bridge_> <ryozuki> what might not is the syntaxes
19:17 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't think the assembly syntax ever changed
19:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but there are 2
19:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> (except that gnu for whatever reason had to introduce their own dialect for x86 assembly)
19:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> if anything dies, it's the gnu one, but I doubt that, too
19:18 < bridge_> <ryozuki> at&t or intel
19:18 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> gnu = at&t
19:19 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe the intel syntax is propietary?
19:19 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> gas supports intel syntax
19:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> every assembler I know of supports intel syntax
19:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> every tool I know of that supports at&t syntax also supports intel syntax
19:20 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> but definitely not the other way around
19:20 < bridge_> <ryozuki> nasm supports both ithink
19:21 < bridge_> <learath2> I'm more used to intel syntax
19:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd actually have thought u read binary code directly
19:23 < bridge_> <Jupstar ‚ú™> who needs english
19:39 < bridge_> <learath2> Machine code, yes

19:56 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `tvb_memcpy(src, dst, ‚Ä¶)`
19:57 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `tvb_memcpy(src, dst, offset, len)`
20:14 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Heinrich you speak in puzzles
20:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> do you see anything wrong with that `memcpy` function?
20:22 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> something, say, unusual
20:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why offset
20:22 < bridge_> <ryozuki> dont u just offset  the ptr
20:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i guess the arg order?
20:23 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i think its usually dst, src
20:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, the arg order
20:24 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> is what tripped me up
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i seen this in rust
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this is is rust memcpy
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ptr/fn.copy_nonoverlapping.html
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pub const unsafe fn copy_nonoverlapping<T>(
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     src: *const T,
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     dst: *mut T,
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     count: usize
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> )
20:25 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```rust
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> pub const unsafe fn copy_nonoverlapping<T>(
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     src: *const T,
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     dst: *mut T,
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki>     count: usize
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> )
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ```
20:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that function is not called `memcpy`
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i know
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> read the docs
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah u mean urs?
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > Copies count * size_of::<T>() bytes from src to dst. The source and destination must not overlap.
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> >

20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > copy_nonoverlapping is semantically equivalent to C‚Äôs memcpy, but with the argument order swapped.
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > 
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> > The copy is ‚Äúuntyped‚Äù in the sense that data may be uninitialized or otherwise violate the requirements of T. The initialization state is preserved exactly.
20:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I was mostly complaining about the very common name `memcpy`
20:26 < bridge_> <ryozuki> ah
20:26 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> and not having the same argument order
20:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> where is this from? tvb_memcpy
20:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> wireshark
20:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> dissector
20:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
20:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991>  * "testy, virtual(-izable) buffer".  They are testy in that they get mad when
20:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991>  * an attempt is made to access data beyond the bounds of their array. In that
20:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991>  * case, they throw an exception.
20:27 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ```
20:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i like how rust  name is so explicit
20:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> instead of memcpy
20:28 < bridge_> <ryozuki> it says the most important thing in the name
20:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> what I also like in rust is how the function providing more guarantees has the shorter name
20:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> compare `ptr::copy_nonoverlapping` vs `ptr::copy`
20:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `sort_unstable` vs `sort`
20:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `[]` vs `unchecked_get`
20:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> `unreachble!` vs `unreachable_unchecked`
20:33 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> in C++ it's almost the opposite
20:38 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yeah
20:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i would say .get() here
20:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> but ye
20:39 < bridge_> <ryozuki> same applies
20:40 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I guess `[]` vs `get` is a place where the shorter option isn't the one poviding more guarantees

21:27 < bridge_> <ryozuki> this shows reports should always tell the client version
21:29 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't see that
21:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> yeah cuz the report doesnt have it
21:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> i meant it should
21:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't see that this shows that reports must have a version
21:30 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think there's a balance
21:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> why not? the version info would point to the issue faster
21:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> also in case the error is repro u can bisect
21:30 < bridge_> <ryozuki> with a known version already
21:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> > why not?
21:32 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because an issue is valuable even if you don't know the version number. if a version number is a requirement for an issue to be opened, we might see fewer issues being opened
21:33 < bridge_> <ryozuki> hmm
21:34 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe we should remember to ask the version after a report then xd

22:26 < bridge_> <ketabube> Nobody in the industry likes to admit it to themselves but when Playboi Carti signed Pusha T to 1017 he dead made him bust to a bitmoji and forced him to lay in a bathtub with his legs and ankles shackled vertically towards the ceiling. They took pictures of it like an album cover shoot with an entire team of lighting engineers and professional cameramen. Dude had to go to the hospital and suffered internal hemorrhaging in his colon because of it

22:27 < bridge_> <ketabube> By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure

22:31 < bridge_> <matodor> ye its worked on ddnet latest build
22:55 < bridge_> <teero777> i checked for myself again and projectiles break in the prediction if the macro is commented ou
22:56 < bridge_> <teero777> if projectiles collide with something they either just stop and do nothing or for example the grenade stops on collision and just emitts the explosion every tick without getting deleted
22:57 < bridge_> <teero777> then after some ticks it gets deleted
22:57 < bridge_> <teero777> very weird
22:57 < bridge_> <teero777> then after around 20-300 ticks it gets deleted
23:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> maybe a new one gets allocated in that place after the ticks u mention
23:02 < bridge_> <ryozuki> idk xd
