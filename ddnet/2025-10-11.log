00:23 < bridge_> <totar> I think doing semantic html is good if it makes sense, like tables should use table elements. But most stuff just ends up as div anyway because the web wasnt designed to create good layouts so theres no good name to give them
00:25 < bridge_> <totar> I guess I like using tailwind which makes it easy to use the correct element name because it doesnt affect the css at all
04:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> the concept that we need frameworks to accomplish stuff is just mind boggling to me
04:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> you can already write very very concise html and css
04:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> it just adds more steps
04:30 < bridge_> <Ewan> makes me think "the browser is not enough of a framework for u ppl?"
04:57 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I mean kinda not since the browser is such an ancient and jank standard
04:57 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but that's really not something that should be fixed by building more crap on top of it...
05:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> "the browser is an ancient standard"
05:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's not like, fixed in place
05:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> they change stuff all the time
05:03 < bridge_> <Ewan> if there was more of an emphasis on improving the lowest common denominator instead of making quick cash off of ad-hoc solutions, the web would be way better
05:04 < bridge_> <Ewan> an immediate example is css variables, the majority of frontend devs are using whatever their framework provides for variable support despite the fact that the built in css version works just fine and has room for optimization within the browser
05:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> it's just that they were only universally available well after the frameworks had their foot in the door
05:05 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> yeah the bigger issue is backwards compatibility
05:05 < bridge_> <inv41idu53rn4m3> even if a new well designed standard was added you wouldn't be able to use it properly until a decade from now
05:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> yeah
05:05 < bridge_> <Ewan> it should beg the question of whether you really need what is being asked for
05:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> and they deprecate stuff all the time, as well as revolutionize without removing the old stuff
05:06 < bridge_> <Ewan> flex immediately comes to mind
08:37 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Oh boi robsi merged the cursed save code pr xd
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i wonder how reliable the max amount of ram is that `htop` shows
10:29 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** my vps showed 9.7G earlier now it shows 11.8G and I pay for 16G xd
10:30 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** do i complain to the hoster or ignore it? 
10:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** oke i asked hoster xd
10:33 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** > We use a technology called "ballooning" on our VPS servers to manage RAM dynamically. Because of this, tools like htop can show a lower amount of RAM than you have actually booked, but your server always has access to the full 16 GB when needed. This does not impact performance.
10:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** i got scammed huh?
10:34 < ws-client1> **<ChillerDragon>** balooning lmao
10:35 < bridge_> <totar> browsers basically never deprecate anything ever, even if it's removed from the "spec" because it breaks websites.
10:48 < bridge_> <totar> Try making a CSR website and see if you still have this opinion lol. 
10:48 < bridge_> <totar> 
10:48 < bridge_> <totar> Clean well pruned html and css is well and good if you have a static site or maybe php, but if you want huge interactivity with an API and dynamic pages then you realize why the frameworks exist.
10:57 < bridge_> <totar> and I should say that if you are making a static site then you shouldn't use a framework or anything complicated, but theres a time and place for them
12:16 < bridge_> <qxdfox> Has anything changed about weapon prediction recently?
12:18 < bridge_> <qxdfox> Nvm I'm going crazy
12:25 < bridge_> <123rollenbaan fan> hi going crazy im melon
12:25 < bridge_> <manikoo> hi 123rollenbaan im manikoo
16:45 < bridge_> <Ewan> Yes, they have fancy features
16:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> Ajax requests are not complicated especially if you write your own library for wrapping API calls
16:46 < bridge_> <Ewan> This is not a lot of code
16:49 < bridge_> <Ewan> Deprecate is the word they use, why do they have to remove the functionality outright for it to be deprecated
16:53 < bridge_> <Teero> ofc lol? deprecated means it means you should not use it from that point on and any bugs related to it won't be fixed. It doesn't mean it's removed.
16:54 < bridge_> <Ewan> Teero don't you know that convolution = innovation
