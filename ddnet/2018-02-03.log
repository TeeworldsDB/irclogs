12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> Why not on official wikipedia?
12:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> ah nvm, didnt know what archlinux was
12:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Justafish> can I change color/style on entities? I would like the "hookable" to be just one single color
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u change the entities.png
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then yes
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Justafish> where is it located?
13:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mm i think under data/
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Justafish> haha, I was looking there. This is why I didnt find it. Gotta love windows photo viewer

15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> What did add to DDCoala

15:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> What did add to DDCoala xD
19:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RafaelFF> I'm adding a RAM consumption warning about using the whole DDNet Skin Database to Arch Linux's DDNet page.    It seems to me that it adds 120MB usage to the RAM (that's what I calculated in my computer). Would this statement be correct?
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sounds good

21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> !!!
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> its a feature
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> not a bug
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> xd
21:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> does anyone know why m_LastIndexTile and m_LastIndexFrontTile is not declared in character.cpp? ðŸ˜„
21:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon sure
21:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> but @ChillerDragon i can think of great parts using this as an intended technique ðŸ˜„
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> "does anyone know why m_LastIndexTile and m_LastIndexFrontTile is not declared in character.cpp?"
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> --> and how i get them to work ^^
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> since when  has this been a channel for reporting problems with shitty cheat clients

21:47 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/vNxRr
21:47 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/master a00d411 def: Version 11.0.3
21:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <DanilBest> Released :D
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut what do you mean, they're not declared?
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> @Dev What about rebuilding the old tilerender behavior (borderbug) in the opengl renderer like @fokkonaut requested. At least he complained a while ago that tiles are rendered differently. Suppose this is a job for Jupeyy if it should be done.
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @CrashtimeHD yea, might be a sensible project
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can try it, too ðŸ˜‰
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> I pass
22:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 im coding in ddnet 9 (chillerdragons src, you should know it) and im trying to use the m_LastIndex or something like that. My bam says its not declaired and it doesnt build the server
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @CrashtimeHD yes, the old tilerender is way better. scroll up a lot and you will see Difference screens
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> i know
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut @CrashtimeHD is saying that hte bugs of the old render are impacting the new one ðŸ˜„
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> atleast i know that they are different
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> no, i said that the old one has the known borderbug and the new one doesnt have it
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, you were asking to replicate the old bug in the new render
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which is a reasonable thing to ask
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> ah, sry now i get your point
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> old bug -> so we need to rebuild the bug
23:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <CrashtimeHD> thats what you mean with impacting, sry
23:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 any solutions for lastindex?
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I know that its working in XXLDDRace, but why not in ddnet?
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry, currently doing too many things at once
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe try again in half an hour or so
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> okay
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <saibotu> if you need it just add it to CCharacter and set LastIndex = TileIndex at the end of HandleTiles
23:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> where exactly do i find it^
23:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i mean where to put it what :/
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> you mean putting this at the end of where i need it?
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> m_LastIndexTile = m_TileIndex;
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 	m_LastIndexFrontTile = m_TileFIndex;
