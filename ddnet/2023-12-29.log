00:12 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> Why? Are you byte_ing_?
00:13 < bridge> <Ewan> i cannot go to europe for a conference
00:23 < bridge> <zwelf2> I didn't go to a conference oversee yet too. Attending is entirely different whether it is only a 2h train ride away or needs transatlantic flight.
00:27 < bridge> <avolicious> And nowadays after the pandemic, mostly conferences offer hybrid attendance.

00:48 < bridge> <fudgy_> does ddnet server send a chat message to 0.7 clients when someone finishes a race? I don't seem to receive anything
01:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> 0.7 has special netmessages for race which are being used
01:07 < bridge> <fokkonaut> They send the text clientside
01:08 < bridge> <fudgy_> hmm for some reason I think I dont receive any type of message when someone finishes, I get the start message tho
01:08 < bridge> <fudgy_> I will keep looking..
01:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/a1911c8f7d8458fb4076ef8e7651e8ef5e91ab3e/src/game/client/components/infomessages.cpp#L103

01:37 < bridge> <fudgy_> Ok I understand the problem. If I'm on 0.7 client and someone with 0.7 client finishes, it works. But if I'm 0.7 and the one finishing is not on 0.7, I have this message in console instead : [client]: dropped weird message 'invalid' (0), failed on '(type out of range)'
01:46 < bridge> <fokkonaut> @learath2
02:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> quick question, what is the formula for converting ddnet score points into race timings?
02:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> score + 9999 = milliseconds?
02:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> something along the lines?
02:42 < bridge> <jxsl13> hmk, it's just seconds ._.
07:39 < ChillerDragon> @Ewan thanks for teaching me english i never get a vs an. Also why do you talk about js not bout error? is the "a" not pointing to error instead of js in the stence "a javascript error"
07:41 < ChillerDragon> @fudgy_ are you working on something or just playing? On official ddnet servers? with latest teeworlds client?
07:43 < bridge> <fudgy_> Im playing with a 0.7 client from like 3 years ago. It's annoying to not see finish times when playing race with others
07:57 < bridge> <fudgy_> Since other players are not using 0.7, it's sending the 0.6 net message and my 0.7 client cant parse it or smth
08:07 < bridge> <furo321> Yeah, that's a bug. I'll try to fix it.
08:10 < ChillerDragon> lmao ofc furo is fixing it xd
08:11 < ChillerDragon> @furo321 thanks for writing it. I mean i shouldve guessed it by now that youll fix it xd. But i almost started looking into it xd
08:13 < bridge> <furo321> :)
08:16 < bridge> <Ewan> because it only has to do with the word immediately after it
08:16 < bridge> <Ewan> "a stack overflow"
08:16 < bridge> <Ewan> "an overflow"
08:16 < bridge> <Ewan> something to do with having to have a constinent sound to make the words flow smoother
08:16 < bridge> <Ewan> because something like "a error" creates an awkward transition from vowel to vowel
08:17 < bridge> <Ewan> uhh errurr
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonority_sequencing_principle>
08:18 < bridge> <Ewan> something to do with having to have a *consonent sound to make the words flow smoother
08:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> O thanks
10:27 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i can't see what is CNetObj_CharacterCore and it's members
10:28 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i just know the core read and write with it
10:52 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Because the code is generated with python. That confuses most IDEs
10:53 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You can open the src folder in your build folder to see its defintion
11:09 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> thank you that explains
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks
11:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> > It's not called out in the release notes announcement, but rustc will now automatically enable cross-crate inlining for small functions. This leads to both compilation time wins and runtime performance improvements. They are small in this initial implementation, but I expect it to be tuned over time.
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> nice
11:28 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 2024 will be the year of good rust additions
11:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> > "cargo new" inside a workspace now automatically adds the new crate to the workspace members!
13:37 < bridge> <warner6439> is https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/6914 fully implemented? because i don't see a redirect rcon command anywhere
13:42 < bridge> <burnyllama> I don't think there's a command for it, you're meant to manually send the `NETMSG_REDIRECT` net message in your code, but maybe one should be added?
13:44 < ChillerDragon> @warner6439 yes its fully implemented and working. Ofc not all clients support it yet. You are meant to use this api ``void CServer::RedirectClient(int ClientID, int Port, bool Verbose)``
13:45 < ChillerDragon> @burnyllama there is no rcon command and heinrich was against adding one so there probably wont be any any time soon
13:45 < ChillerDragon> > No, I think that options in the official DDNet server are also important. If people want to use this for moderation, they'd have to patch the source by themselves, which can be enough friction that people might not do it.
13:59 < ChillerDragon> @furo321 when add colored broadcast hehe
13:59 < ChillerDragon> its on my todo so it must also be on urs
15:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks another unsound MT access rust would prevent
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> ```cpp
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> int a = 5;
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> if(a != -1 && (int b = 2))
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> {
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> 
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> }
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> ```
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> why does this throw a syntax error?
15:13 < bridge> <patiga> why are you doing this
15:13 < bridge> <patiga> xd
15:13 < bridge> <teero777> making things better
15:14 < bridge> <teero777> i want "b" only to be in the scope of the if statement and also check if the variable i assign to b is not 0
15:15 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> too bad that you cannot code it in the next 48hours :/
15:15 < bridge> <teero777> well it works like `if(int b = 2)`
15:15 < bridge> <teero777> but not with parentheses around it
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> why not simply do a brace around it
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> {
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> int b = 2;
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> if ...
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> }
15:16 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> then the braces are your scope
15:16 < bridge> <nouaa> int a = 5;
15:16 < bridge> <nouaa> 
15:16 < bridge> <nouaa> if (int b = 2; a != -1 && b != 0)
15:16 < bridge> <nouaa> {
15:16 < bridge> <nouaa> 
15:16 < bridge> <nouaa> }
15:16 < bridge> <teero777> the 2 in my example might be a function call that i dont want to do twice
15:16 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> compiler expects an expression, not a declaration ig?
15:16 < bridge> <teero777> kinda ugly but it was my first guess too
15:17 < bridge> <nouaa> declarations in if's are allowed since cpp17
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> `if(int a = 4)`
15:17 < bridge> <teero777> is fine
15:18 < bridge> <teero777> ah wait i overlooked it
15:18 < bridge> <teero777> mybad
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> well honestly. you really never need to have a declaration inside a if
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> i bet there is a better way
15:18 < bridge> <teero777> works ty
15:18 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> in worst case accept a second if statement
15:18 < bridge> <nouaa> :owo:
15:18 < bridge> <nouaa> shit code anyways
15:19 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :owo:
15:21 < bridge> <nouaa> see, im big dev
15:21 < bridge> <nouaa> should get that role at some point
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> big
15:26 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
15:27 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> couldnt you use structured bindings for that use case? https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/structured_binding
15:29 < bridge> <teero777> cpp hard
15:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ```cpp
15:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> int a = 5;
15:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
15:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> if(a != -1) {
15:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr>   auto [b] = FooBar();
15:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> }
15:29 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ```
15:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ```cpp
15:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> int a = 5;
15:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> if (auto [b] = fooBar(); a != -1 && b != 0)
15:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> {
15:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> }
15:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ```
15:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
15:31 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> to assign value to b and then check if b != 0) or smth
15:35 < bridge> <teero777> thats what nouaaa said earlier xd
15:35 < bridge> <teero777> .
15:35 < ChillerDragon> @ryozuki now that you llvm and rust core maintainer you are basically professional language designer right? Any chance you get some fixed into the german spec for me?
15:36 < ChillerDragon> for example the german number system is fucked some drunk lang designer messed up ordering of double digit numbers
15:36 < ChillerDragon> s/fixed/fixes/
15:37 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> structured bindings allow you to assign complex types to b, while the latter only allows simple types, but yeah, they basically do the same 😛
15:39 < bridge> <teero777> wdym simple types
15:39 < bridge> <teero777> well it works with CGameContext
15:39 < bridge> <teero777> is that a simple type?
15:41 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ```cpp
15:41 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> simple:
15:41 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
15:41 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> int a = 5;
15:41 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> float b = 3.14;
15:41 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> char c = 'A';
15:41 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
15:41 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> complex:
15:42 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> 
15:42 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> int arr[] = {1, 2, 3};
15:42 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> ```
15:43 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> classes are actually considered complex types, because they can hold data structures with multiple values, i dun fckn know >_<
16:31 < bridge> <Pepsicola_o0> xD
16:37 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> brah, i just found out you guys remove the m_hookTick in Core upon character getting endless hook, i thought the problem was my code for 1 hour :justatest:
16:53 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> this makes cpp programmers cry
17:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> don't fix it tho, i wanna make hook upgrading system with it :feelsamazingman:
17:07 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> it works fine with prediction 🙂
17:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> @jupeyy_keks i broke my promise
17:23 < bridge> <ryozuki> i coded in rust
17:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> i got a minimalistic game idea
17:27 < bridge> <ryozuki> time to try again with bevy
17:32 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> rust makes you weak
17:33 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> Did you talk to meloƞ? How did the therapy session go?
17:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> :NekoEvil:
17:34 < bridge> <Mr.Gh0s7> (I'm refering to this btw :kek: )
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ✪> 😬
17:44 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> :kek:
17:45 < bridge> <blaiszephyr> Ryo if rust keeps you hostage, write unsafe code twice and we'll help you!
19:19 < ChillerDragon> @blaiszephyr xd
20:00 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> hum
20:02 < ChillerDragon> ger10 doing some extra shenangians today?
20:02 < ChillerDragon> i cant connect .-.
20:03 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1703876587.png
20:05 < bridge> <deen> use https://ger10.ddnet.org/
20:08 < ChillerDragon> did you update something?
20:08 < ChillerDragon> ah nice it works now
20:09 < ChillerDragon> wat did u do
20:09 < ChillerDragon> oh holy shit or does http://ger10.ddnet.org/ not work?
20:09 < ChillerDragon> somehow neither my browser nor the webserver upgrades me to https 
20:09 < ChillerDragon> it still says verified but does not seem to work
20:11 < ChillerDragon> @deen if you did not fix something i assume the http version does not work. Maybe you could setup a redirect c:
20:15 < bridge> <deen> @davide55 ^
20:16 < ChillerDragon> deen arent u hosting the web?
20:18 < bridge> <deen> yes, but not the way the whitelist works
20:18 < ChillerDragon> then you can fix it
20:18 < bridge> <davide55> Pretty weird
20:18 < ChillerDragon> no need to adapt the whitelist
20:18 < ChillerDragon> just add a http to https redirect
20:19 < ChillerDragon> sounds reasonable anyways
20:19 < bridge> <davide55> It should be http only as I can remember
20:19 < ChillerDragon> well i typed ger10.ddnet.org into my browser arrived at http and it didnt work then i clicked deens https link and i could join
20:19 < bridge> <davide55> Oh nvm, it's HTTPS too, still, even HTTP whitelists you, both works
20:19 < ChillerDragon> maybe it was just some other bug then 
20:19 < bridge> <davide55> Let me check
20:19 < ChillerDragon> i didnt change anything
20:20 < ChillerDragon> i tried like 3 servers when it didnt work
20:20 < bridge> <davide55> I confirm it should work even with HTTP
20:29 < ChillerDragon> i am not at home. I think at home usually the http also works for me. Yea maybe it was something else. 
20:29 < ChillerDragon> Do you need me to test something? You can kick me and i can try http again if you are curious @davide55
20:29 < bridge> <davide55> Sure, send me your IP addr somwhere and I'll remove you from the verified map
20:30 < bridge> <davide55> Sure, send me your IP addr somewhere and I'll remove you from the verified map
20:30 < ChillerDragon> i can whisper u in game
20:30 < ChillerDragon> securest channel
20:30 < ChillerDragon> u online? xd
20:30 < bridge> <davide55> Wait
20:30 < bridge> <davide55> Done, joined
20:30 < bridge> <davide55> Username is Davide55
20:31 < ChillerDragon> go join me at zillyhuhn.com
20:31 < ChillerDragon> i wanna grab ur ip too xd
20:31 < bridge> <davide55> Oh, I'm in a random DDNet server
20:31 < bridge> <davide55> Just search for my username
20:31 < ChillerDragon> bliet ok
20:31 < ChillerDragon> on a random ger10 ? -.
20:32 < bridge> <davide55> Yes
20:33 < ChillerDragon> ok i can confirm http works
20:33 < ChillerDragon> still deen i think a https redirect would be cool just for coolness sake
20:33 < bridge> <davide55> Good
20:34 < ChillerDragon> no idea what happend earlier tho
20:34 < ChillerDragon> thanks for the quick response davide UwU
20:35 < bridge> <davide55> No problems
20:35 < bridge> <davide55> I'll also check the UDP challenge as soon as I can
20:35 < bridge> <davide55> Maybe it needs a few updates
20:35 < ChillerDragon> i personally do not mind the http request too much since it can even be done via curl
20:35 < ChillerDragon> but i guess the general public would appreciate it
20:35 < bridge> <davide55> Okok
20:36 < ChillerDragon> maybe it also doesnt work because of my hax client
20:36 < bridge> <davide55> Would be good to implement an automatic curl request before the join
20:36 < bridge> <davide55> Oh, yes can be
20:36 < ChillerDragon> i send some custom ddnet ex messages
20:36 < ChillerDragon> identifying my client as it self to the server
20:36 < bridge> <davide55> 😄
20:37 < ChillerDragon> i think some custom client does the automatic curl within the client already
20:37 < bridge> <davide55> Just tried with latest version from Steam and seems to work, pretty slowly but it works 😄
20:38 < ChillerDragon> ok nice
20:38 < bridge> <davide55> Can be
20:38 < ChillerDragon> if it rly is my extra msg that confuses ur prot thats totally fine
20:38 < ChillerDragon> its one alt+tab and ctrl+r ger10 enter
20:38 < bridge> <davide55> 😄
20:38 < ChillerDragon> i had the curl running in a loop on my raspi for fokkos server when i was actively playing xd
20:39 < bridge> <davide55> LOL
20:39 < ChillerDragon> worked like a charm
20:39 < bridge> <davide55> Sadly DDNet is super sensitive, so protections must be extremely aggressive to avoid crash/lags
20:39 < bridge> <davide55> Sadly DDNet is super sensitive, so protections must be extremely aggressive to avoid crashes/lags
20:39 < ChillerDragon> seems fair
20:40 < ChillerDragon> as i said i have no problem but it would be sad if new players or even old but non technical players rq on the issue :c
20:41 < ChillerDragon> but i think everything is smooth and the protection does work really well
20:41 < ChillerDragon> i barley play these days last time i played there were a few lags on ger10 but never longer than a few seconds
20:42 < ChillerDragon> might as well have been non ddos issues idk
20:43 < bridge> <davide55> I should move the DDNet VM to the new DC, it would be probably even more stable as connectivity
20:43 < bridge> <davide55> And even less ping
20:43 < bridge> <davide55> And even less ping (2-3ms, nothing crazy)
20:43 < bridge> <davide55> And even less ping (2-3ms less, nothing crazy)
20:43 < bridge> <davide55> I should move the DDNet GER10 VM to the new DC, it would be probably even more stable as connectivity
20:44 < bridge> <davide55> Maybe we can plan that @deen
20:44 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what is the best method to give the player msg without spamming his chat ? (not broadcast)
20:44 < bridge> <davide55> Maybe we can schedule that @deen
20:44 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> what is the best method to give the player msg without spamming his chat ? (don't wanna use broadcast)
20:45 < bridge> <deen> sure, i can spin down the servers and tell you when it‘s done?
20:46 < bridge> <davide55> Else I can just create you a new VM on the new DC, maybe it's faster? Depends on your installer
20:46 < bridge> <davide55> Else I can just create you a new VM on the new DC, maybe it's faster? Depends on your install script
20:49 < bridge> <davide55> (Migrating a VM can require a few hours depending on the disk size)
20:52 < ChillerDragon> @mamad_melanin there is also the message of the day `sv_motd` and you can also use non important broadcast that will not overwrite important broadcasts in ddnet server code
20:53 < ChillerDragon> you could also use in game stuff like projectiles in the snap for conveing information
20:53 < ChillerDragon> fng even uses it for score numbers or BW for texts on kills
20:54 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> yes i seen it
20:54 < ChillerDragon> if you need another channel for sending text like custom popups you would have to modify the client
20:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> i seen "balance the teams" in fng, the msg shows up on screen, how about that ?
20:55 < ChillerDragon> there are a few of those but they are hardcodet
20:55 < ChillerDragon> you can not set a custom message there
20:55 < bridge> <mamad_melanin> :feelsbadman:
20:56 < ChillerDragon> ye its not like in minecraft
20:56 < ChillerDragon> its insane what custom ui a vanilla minecraft client can display
21:42 < bridge> <deen> yes, that‘s faster. then we can shut down the old after a few hours
