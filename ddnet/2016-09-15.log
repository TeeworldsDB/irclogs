14:46 <+laxa> deen: hi, I have a question
14:46 <+laxa> I am thinking to make a python script to connect to a server and be able to chat / receive messages for teeworlds
14:47 <+laxa> just for fun actually
14:47 <+laxa> but I think it might be problematic if some people use it, so I am wondering if I should make it open source if I ever make such a tool
14:52 <@heinrich5991> that should be good to open source
14:52 <+laxa> alright
15:01 <@deen> hi. sounds fine
