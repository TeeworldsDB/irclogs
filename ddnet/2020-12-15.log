03:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> apparently trying to run 27 (or more) .cfg files back to back makes the game freeze and crash xD not sure if this is a good thing or bad
03:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If it's reproducible please create an issue for it so it can be fixed
03:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> not sure why someone would have 27 exec files linked to each other tbh, just a fun fact
04:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> not sure why someone would have 27 cfg files linked to each other tbh, just a fun fact
04:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yeah, but it's still a bug in the code, sometimes fixing one bug helps fix another
04:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Though that one might just be your running out of stack space because we recurse too deep
04:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> also not sure if the amount of commands in each file makes any difference, I just have a bunch of files with this `echo 21; exec meme_22.cfg;` increasing each number with every file

05:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @Matodor cool! Reprodusable?
05:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> i think no üòÑ I entered the moment when the vote took place
05:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @Matodor yes, I wanted to ask you that. Did you enter the "Memories" map while vote was going
05:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> lol, i have a demo, that too wrong map
05:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Matodor> uploaded to the pull request
06:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen could you make a vote "Do you use english ddnet translation or other?" please? So I can see if it worth the effort to make "adaptive UI"
06:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> @deen could you make a vote "Do you use english ddnet translation or other?" please? So I can see if it worth the effort to make "adaptive UI" or I can just go for optimisation and good english looking

06:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I always consider possibilities of line be too long in other languages, but it looks bad if so

06:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> for Ukrainian the "reset" word does not fit into button rectangle, but still usable
06:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> anyway looks ugly
06:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> if that worth it I could make this thing fully adaptive, so it will find the longest line and use the same offset for buttons, as well as adjust button width to fit the whole word
08:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è No need for a vote I think. Many use translations
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Did I miss something in todays part 2? Where was the challange?
09:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Did I miss something in todays part 2? Where was the challenge?
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Okay I guess you could have solved part 1 with a vector searching backwards
09:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Okay I guess you could have solved part 1 with a vector searching backwards for the last occurence

11:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 11 hours of gameplay later, I can confidently say cyberpunk really feels like one of my projects. Overly ambitious but ultimately abandoned due to an exponentially increasing project complexity

11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> wtf it works
11:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> but it's not that big is it?
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> 16mb stack size
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for the stack it's too big
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> is probably too big
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> ye
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> for heap no problem
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> just calloc
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> yeah lol
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> deen 2 fast
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> wow ok thx
11:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <noby> üòÑ
11:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Allocate more stack
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how would u do that?
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ulimit -s
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i see
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> mine is 8mb
12:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @timakro agreed, part 2 was no work today
12:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I always get annoyed at the AoC guy misreading instructions for Part 1 üòÑ
12:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I wished you could see part 2 from the beginning, I like to write my programs to print the answer to both so if I knew both puzzles I could factor out the common from the beginning
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen Whenn will you start using some more exotic languages
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I had some more exotic ones in the beginning
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> currently I've gotten lazy
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> right, i don't know what swipl is :D
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Prolog
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> ah
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Actually the best language for solving puzzles
13:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I also wanted to use Z3, C++ Templates, C preprocessor, SQL, Makefile, Sed, but they are all a bit awkward to use
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Makefile?
13:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Can you program in a Makefile?
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Apparently they are
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> turing complete
13:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Yes, you can: https://github.com/kanaka/mal/tree/master/impls/make
13:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Some other interesting language uses too
13:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen If you have to kill some time ^^ https://codewithrockstar.com/
13:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'd rather use Ook!https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/ook.html
13:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Haha, I like it :)
14:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Lol what
14:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/788391895369121833/IMG_20201215_210524.jpg

14:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> there is a problem with the automapper in the latest version, the game crashes randomly when you use it
14:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @TsFreddie yeah that's verybroken
14:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The issue is that when the window is created the resolution is wrong
14:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so on macos you have to set the GL viewport at start?
14:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @TsFreddie is that on fullscreen or what?
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> Fullscreen on
14:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> toggle fullscreen off and on then I got the second screenshot
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok bcs we actually update the viewport in fullscreen and learath said in mac the canvas size is not equal to window size
14:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> so i could atleast try to patch that
14:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @TsFreddie can u compile on that laptop?
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> or this 
14:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/runs/1557375770?check_suite_focus=true
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @HMH you are alive!
14:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> üëÅÔ∏è
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:sadSnail:785072987815804929>
14:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rip
14:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> How to trick a client so that when entering a certain server, the map is loaded with my changed background.
14:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You'd need code for that, since the client verifies hash sum
14:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> I don't know how to write code, is there a way for an amateur in this area to do this?
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> In CClient::LoadMap in client.cpp you could probably remove the hash-checking code
15:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and then you need to recompile the client
15:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> sneaky peaky, how he just evaded my requested changes by opening the same pr few months later
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> oooh
15:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> sorry, didn't remember that you had requests on the original change
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> @Jupstar ‚ú™
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/788411736839290950/unknown.png
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> oof
15:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> sleep time, maybe next time
15:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> mhh looks annoying xD
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> well also doesnt matter probs @deen 
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> the initialization works bcs in tw everything is static, as soon as we wouldn't do that the zero initlaization would drop and it would require a proper constructor
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> Aslong you read the pr for possible null ptrs its fine
15:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and aslong its consistent and doesnt break after some time xD
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can't build on macOS again...
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is really driving me insane
15:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :cirBlech:
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I get Command Line Tools I can't compile ddnet
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i can't figure out why vscode isn't stopping at breakpoint
15:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> if I don't get command line tools brew can't compile python
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is all soooooo annoying, why do people like to work like this? Why do people tolerate these set ups? How do these even work for other people?
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The state of windows and macos for development is just awful, awful, awful
15:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How am I supposed to work when I have to mess around with my tools every 10 minutes?
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Like now what? CMake is using the clang inside xcode, my developer directory is correctly set to the dev dir in xcode. Yet this clang is using the commandlinetools version of includes
15:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do I go digging into clangs source code?
16:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay figured out it's cmake breaking, now what I dig into cmake?
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> have u used a clean cmake build dir
16:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yes
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> has cmake no debug or verbose mode, maybe the path isnt set in the right order or smth
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> could we maybe get hook tiles on those platfoms here?
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/788422223778021396/screenshot_2020-12-15_16-07-08.png
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> i see a lot of people blocking
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> on multeasymap
16:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Souly> and i think that adding hook tiles on the floor would help people to defend
16:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I narrowed it down to find_path finding a sqlite3.h inside commandlinetools, which is expected, but how it gets there I can't figure out at all
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> this is beside the point anyway, ofc I can debug it given an hour or two, I had an hour to spare and I wanted to look at the clipping issue @TsFreddie saw, now instead I'm wasting time wrestling with tools. Same experience on windows too
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I never get to do any work, I only fix stupid tooling issues
16:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @deen gonna create a quickpatch or a new version?
16:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I bet this one is also going to boil down to some mistake in homebrew like every other macOS build issue I've had, because the person who made homebrew has a messiah complex and created a bloated mess
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 btw i tried to fix it:
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> https://github.com/Jupeyy/ddnet/tree/pr_macos_fix_try
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> u can download the artifact
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> and try if u want xd
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I was surprised when I got the ddnet client building on windows in about an hour even though I never used visual studio before or compiled anything on windows
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I'd just  cherry-pick this one change? I'm not sure if we have other changes with high risk, but don't want to wait around for RCs
16:14 <+ChillerDragon> gj @timakro
16:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> ok
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @timakro if u exclude the cmake process which downloads Gtest always on windows
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> then its strange üòÑ
16:15 <+ChillerDragon> well ok an hour is some time but it can also take an hour alone to dl bloat studio
16:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> maybe disabled multiprocessor on VS?
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> It seems like there are a lot of options on windows with a separate git tool on the git website and the WSL git. Same for cmake, the cmake for windows tool works with a lot of IDEs. You can kinda mix and match and even if you don't really know what you're doing the tools most of the time work together. You never quite understand how though. They must have put a lot of work into making those tools compatible
16:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro you know what works great? Ignoring the windows way of doing things. As soon as I ditched the pipe dream that I'd get to do something the "windows" way once, I got it working in a matter of minutes
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just get msys2, works perfectly. Or use cmd, nmake/ninja and the console version of cmake, works perfectly
16:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yep
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I really hope this guy is onto something
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_Depressed: windows
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> btw cmake has a lot of generators everywhere
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I can generate sublime 3 projects, though no idea why anyone would want that üòõ
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Meh sublime
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Why would anyone use that
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Vscode ecosystem is bigger
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> But vim is bettee
16:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :PES2_Depressed:
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Anyway, seems I will have to strace cmake to figure out what it's doing with pkg_config
16:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll go have fun with that
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> "ld: warning: dylib (/usr/local/lib/libpng16.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (10.15) than being linked (10.9)"
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah now macos is onfire in the libpng pr too
16:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Aaaaand ofc it's homebrew messing with things `Variable declaration, 'homebrew_sdkroot' has value '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk'`
16:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ we either need to start shipping our own version of SDL or push SDL to finally fix the issue so we can start building for 10.15
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> (or we can build libpng too, we build our own curl and ffmpeg already)
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i'd just ignore the system path comletly and dont do a prefer bundled, and then just static link everything
16:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> all problems solved for non linux OS
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> We do build our own libpng
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but not aggressivly enough xD
16:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> macos fails again
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> just rebased to the png_init commit
16:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> then just put some -DPREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON in?
16:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah maybe later, we also have to update the build scripts then etc. pp
16:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> @Learath2 yeah pls get SDL dev, and also fix the window focus under windows
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I've completely lost all the motivation I had, I was going to fix a couple things today but I guess not
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/../include/c++/v1/cmath:317:9: error: no member named 'signbit' in the global namespace` look at this, what am I supposed to do about that?
16:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Do I have to become a compiler engineer too?
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> do u use some experimental libc++ ? XD
16:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> No it's just CommandLineTools as shipped by apple
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> wtf xD
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> how does apple or the clang team even do that on macos
16:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ‚ú™> i use experimental clang and had like no bug in 1 year xd
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I remember I had the same error: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58628377/catalina-c-using-cmath-headers-yield-error-no-member-named-signbit-in-th
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :huh:
16:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen Yeah we had it on CI, I "fixed" it by `rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> XCode comes with a complete set of tools already and they aren't broken
16:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ok üòÑ
16:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> :cirBlech:
16:45 <+ChillerDragon> there is no other os i know that goes so strong to push their own dev toolchain literally every macOS dev has xcode
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Why ship 2 sets of tools even, why are these people like this?
16:46 <+ChillerDragon> 2 sets?
16:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Whenever I'm doing something I try to minimise work. Just isolate the common "tools" into a package and have the IDE use those?
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> CommandLineTools and XCode come with two entirely different set of "tools"
16:47 <+ChillerDragon> woot i did not know
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I finally isolated the issue
16:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no idea how to fix it though xD
16:48 <+ChillerDragon> so when i go to the appstore and dl 4gb xcode i get another version of the tools shipped in ``xcode-select --install`` ?
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> cmake is adding a `-I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk/usr/include` to the compiler line, no idea what adds it, don't have any way to debug it
16:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> i like my way of dealing with these things
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon yes
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <TsFreddie> it's called giving up
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> hm
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> i thougth they depend on each other
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> i remember ``xcode-select --install`` caused a update popup for xcode
16:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I have 4 copies of clang on my computer: inside XCode, inside the CLT, one I built myself to test something and another from brew
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> macports masterrace
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> why would you build clang ur self
16:50 <+ChillerDragon> u nuts?
16:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> That's the only way to rule out Apples insanity
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I accidentally created a file called `-c` how do I delete it?
16:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> rm -- -c
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> thanks, I thought \\-c would work but apparently not üòõ
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> it's not an escaping problem, the shell doesn't do anything with -, the program itself does
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and it's a convention to stop interpreting -args after --
16:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> also important when you allow users to pass file names
16:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and of course I know that because we have the maps -Ikarus-, -JustDoIt- & -SKY IVLAND- on DDNet üòÑ
16:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Okay I can't fix this, the includedir for sqlite3, curl and zlib are all `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk/usr/include` which is correct, but I can't have that passed as `-I` as includes that are part of the system are treated differently
16:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For once I don't even have a vague clue what to do next
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I'll instead go sleep, what an absolute waste of time an entire hour and a half chasing a stupid issue because apple doesn't want to play nice with gnu
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd honestly rather code on a limestone tablet
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 `-isystem`?
16:58 <+ChillerDragon> deen shell pro
16:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Shell Pro Tip: Don't use shell scripts for anything public-facing
16:59 <+ChillerDragon> ima name my new ddnet map like a forkbomb ok?
17:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> call it "--no-preserve-root -rf /".map
17:00 <+ChillerDragon> xd
17:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> nah -isystem doesn't help either, nor could I possibly get cmake to use it anyway
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hahaha `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/../include/c++/v1/stdlib.h:20:15: fatal error: 'stdlib.h' file not found` now I completely broke it
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I figured it out, finally
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Still no idea how to fix it but for whatever reason cmake is using the macOS 11.0 sdk as the sysroot
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So it's building with a very new clang, using a very old sdk, using the headers of a very new sdk
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ```
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SQLite3_INCLUDEDIR:PATH=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk/usr/include
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SQLite3_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk/usr/include``` Here riddle me this one, what could be the possible reason for this?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @deen Isn't the skin database powered by shell scripts?
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> yes, but not the public-facing part
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Did I write this? https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-web/tree/master/www/skins/edit
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> only the moderator-facing part
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> That's comforting
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I could have imagined past me hooking php up to shell scripts :D
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I mean I hooked php up to python for trashmap
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Ah it is accessible via web
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> You just need a login
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> I see
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Think I found a bug in cmake
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was going to sleep, but noticed it's already 1700
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh I actually should have went to sleep. I read 11.0 as 10.11
17:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a simple application that wraps xcode so you can build for all apple platforms called `xcrun`
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `xcrun`¬†links to `libxcselect.dylib`¬†which it immediately calls into and does nothing else
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `libxcselect.dylib` upon this call loads another lib `libxcrun.dylib` dynamically and calls into that
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> which has many calls into `libxcselect.dylib` it's almost like italian bureucracy
18:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> heh, at the end of the chain, it execves an internal version of the binary xcrun
18:30 <+ChillerDragon> @timakro i like to call scripts using sudo from non admin user php code :D
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: you have set up sudo to only let through that particular command?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> have you ever wondered about that dynamic libraries are quite bad concept?
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> i mean, dynamic libraries make sense in C, but in other languages, they are so awful to work with because maintaining ABI compatibility is hard
18:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> you usually end up with exporting plain C functions....
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> something interesting to read: https://www.kix.in/2008/06/19/an-alternative-to-shared-libraries/
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. I like shared libraries
18:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> makes it easy to swap out stuff without recompiling everything
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I found the oddest optimization I've seen in a decade easily
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> openssl security updates *cough*
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This code is full of `strcmp(s, "f") && strcmp(s, "find")`
18:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ehm, that doesn't sound like it's faster
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> does it do integer masks?
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is "r" "run", "n" "no-cache", "k" "kill-cache"
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> maybe they wanted ||
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> aaaah
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> just strcmp being strcmp üòõ
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (and supporting < use case like that)
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @heinrich5991 yes, but it's so fragile... even updating your compiler can break whole thing unless you export `extern "C"` things only
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/788462103336845312/Screenshot_2020-12-15_at_18.46.31.png
18:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Comrade that sounds like the problem of these languages not providing a stable ABI? ^^
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> yes, but it seems they just don't care
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> OOOH
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> this supports h or help
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> yep
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> It's so hard to think when I'm so sleepy :/
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> even modern things like Rust doesn't guarantee ABI stability as far as i know
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> even modern things like Rust don't guarantee ABI stability as far as i know
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> wym, even C++ has some sort of abi stability
18:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but only barely across compilers AFAIK
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @Learath2 yes, but then someone tries to compile a single library on Windows using MSVC and RIP... üòÑ
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yeah C++ is awful at it, that's why I gave it as an example
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Comrade I think there are initiatives to go for ABI stability in rust, but you're right, it doesn't exist right now
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so you can't do some sort of rust shared library in a useful way
18:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> exactly
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> exporting C symbols is the only way
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (except with a C ABI interface, that works, and works good in rust)
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so why does it follow then that shared libraries are bad?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> After an hour of reverse engineering xcrun, I finally figured out what's wrong
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> > [6:40 PM] Comrade: have you ever wondered about that dynamic libraries are quite bad concept?
18:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe they work badly with some languages in practice, but them being a bad *concept*?
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> with most*
18:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 what is it?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> @heinrich5991 you think it's programming languages' fault?
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> xcrun says the current sdk is "10.15.6" since it consults `_cltools_lookup_boot_system_sdk`, but CommandLineTools ships with SDK 11.0, and cmake finds that and uses the latest SDK
18:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So I end up with 10.15 includes and 11.0 includes mixing
18:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> At the end of the day it's apples fault for including sqlite3, curl and zlib headers in their own sdk, who does that even
18:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Actually at the end of the day it's this entire ecosystems fault. homebrew uses the current sdk, xcode uses the current sdk, commandline tools uses the latest sdk, apple in their suggestions say you should use the latest sdk
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> cmake follows apples recommendation, homebrew just is a mess
18:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> @ChillerDragon I feel like there should be a way to run PHP as different users e.g. per application instead of everything running as www-data
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @timakro well php-fpm which does the interpreting runs as a certain user
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah www-data ...
18:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> You could probably run multiple instances of php-fpm per application
18:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <timakro> Yeah could work, but I don't want to experiment with that and go against the "running everything as www-data approach" that's built into nginx, php-fpm and the distro
19:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Comrade well, I'd say "programming language X does not work well with shared libraries", not "shared libraries are a bad concept"
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> is there any programming language other than C that works well with shared libraries?
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> Pascal maybe? üòÑ
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk. what about C#?
19:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm not into that, so I don't know
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Just because there is no good implementation doesn't mean the idea is bad
19:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> as far as i know you can easily load a DLL in C# and call some function from it, so probably yes
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> but does it work with non-MSVC DLLs? üòÑ
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'd guess they follow some ABI, so I'd guess yes
19:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I "fixed" the issue. My new build command is `cmake .. && sed -i "" 's/10\.15/11.0/g' CMakeCache.txt && ninja && install_name_tool -change "/usr/local/opt/sdl2/lib/libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib" "/Users/learath2/Desktop/C/SDL/build/libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib" ./DDNet`
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Overall amazing experience, I'm so glad I'm using this very mature and stable ecosystem
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> is macOS really that bad for devs? üòÑ
19:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only had to patch every piece of the build process together
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> To be honest with you, the fact that I only had to launch 3 instances of ghidra suggests this was quite a simple issue to debug
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if you need 3 instances of ghidra to debug our build process, maybe there's something wrong with it‚Ä¶ üò¶
19:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The install_name_tool one took 3-4 days, resulted in 2 SDL patches, and like 5 frameworks I had to reverse engineer
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 it's not our fault apple is out of their minds
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 I find your perseverance impressive
19:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you're doing much better than I'd do
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We could maybe include a heuristic in our CMakeLists to catch SDK mismatches?
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Comrade> oh no üòÑ
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sounds good
19:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean idk I could file a cmake bug but is it really a bug? Apple suggests you use the latest sdk when building. It's homebrew that's hardcoding the stupid 10.15 sdk in their pkg-configs
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do we take the 10.15 from its pkg-config?
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I could file a homebrew issue but they are kinda right too, xcrun does report the 10.15 sdk being correct because it refers to the boot sdk version
19:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 pkg_check_modules
19:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it results in a `pkg-config --variable=prefix <pkg>`
19:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/os/mac/pkgconfig/10.15/libcurl.pc
19:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> So from there I get the 10.15 sdk in my includedir, and from cmake internals I get 11.0 as the sysroot
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I found a prettier way to do it `SDKROOT=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path) cmake -GNinja ..`
19:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Was reading through the cmake darwin initialization thing and noticed SDKROOT overrides all the heuristics
19:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'll hold off on filing a bug anywhere
19:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh finally I can check the resizing thing üòÑ
19:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice üôÇ
19:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Another interesting experience I had was when we were debugging the curl thing for osx cross compilation. I actually had to read a fair bit of clang source code for that one
19:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Jupstar ‚ú™ not sure if it was you but we seem to have broken gfx_resizable somewhere along the way
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I just remembered fullscreen was quite broken on macOS, @TsFreddie how did you even get it to launch?
19:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Even 0.7 resorts to using "fake fullscreen" on macOS
19:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If I launch ddnet fullscreen right now, it does some weird stuff then it starts windowed, yada yada we end up with the broken clipping, but changing resolutions fixes that quickly
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Fullscreen is Broken om every OS
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Useless function
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> Fullscreen is Broken on every OS
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> huh
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's not useless, it can give more FPS
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> it never broke for me
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I mean in OS API
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <–î—è–¥—è –ñ–µ–Ω—è> I mean in OS API, not ddnet game
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <plsplsplslol> :tee_thinking:
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> how do you stop players from accidentally uploading their key material somewhere?
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ideas: name the same something like "do_not_share.txt"
20:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 2) spread the keys across multiple files which would make it annoying to upload
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 3) use alternate streams, different positions to hide some key data
20:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 4) encrypt it with the local user profile (works on windows, probably mac, don't know about linux). chrome does this I think
20:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> 5) encrypt it with some local details about the hardware, need some resilience in case the hardware changes
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 why are we stopiing people from uploading key material?
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we don't have any key material üòõ
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ye, if we do add it at some point
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm thinking accounts again
20:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> sorry üòá
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (hm, I shouldn't do emojis)
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üòÑ
20:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah, I would put it in the keychain on mac, I bet there is a equivalent on windows, for linux we can try the gnome keyring, if not available we can try store it in an annoying way
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yea, windows has something that chrome uses to encrypt the cookie db
20:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I know because chrome wouldn't let me borrow my cookies)
20:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. but then it'd be hard for the user to transfer it to another PC üò¶
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh btw, I was reverse engineering LeagueClient (because it wouldn't let me log in without riot client), I learned about a very effective way to analyze TLS traffic decrypted
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> SSLKEYLOGFILE, did you know this existed???
20:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Wireshark can directly parse this file and decrypt all the traffic
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it even works for the new quic libraries
20:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> at least for quiche (cloudflare's)
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> > In CClient::LoadMap in client.cpp you could probably remove the hash-checking code
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <GeMoVeR_Packch> @deen  what i need to delete in the file? Sorry, im not C++ progranmer.

20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> enhance
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Entering the danger zone writing C++ code when you're not a C++ programmer xD
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 if that's not available it seems your best bet is frida, you can just hook whichever ssl library they are using
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> YES
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> frida is amazing
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I used it before
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's sooo good, and I only used a tiny bit of it
20:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think I advertised it here before üòõ
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> perhaps I got it from you, idk
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Brilliant idea really, injecting a v8 engine into a program
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm, not sure how I feel about it being JS
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I guess it's the only real thing you can easily embed
20:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> so it's probably the right choice
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @YupHio guess how I started in tw code üòõ
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well they could have injected a wasm vm too
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> less easy to handle I guess
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you only want to script and suddenly you have to handle ABIs and whatnot
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> well V8 hooks about as well into C as WASM afaik
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ehm I mean for the "end user" using frida
20:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> if it was WASM, you'd have to compile your frida modules
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> when most of the time, you'd be fine with some one-off script
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ah they don't inject v8 apparently it's quickjs, could have sworn it was v8
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> anyway yeah I see what you mean
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> @heinrich5991 Haha same. Modding TW code is how I got into coding about 11 years ago, then I ended up going to college and got my degree in computer science. Now I'm a software developer, and all because I wanted to make an aimbot for a game that nobody played xD
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @YupHio nice üôÇ
21:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where do you work now (if you're comfortable sharing)
21:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I work at Boeing. It's not really a "software" company, but I love aerospace and they treat me well.
21:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you work on some high-assurance stuff? ^^
21:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Yeah. Many of my applications are FAA accredited, and many are core/critical such that if there is a problem then airplanes potentially fall out of the sky...
21:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Kinda makes it less stressful in a way, because the company is willing to give me as much time as I need to code/test things correctly, due to the high risk. Not the sort of job where we are pushing crap code out the door every two weeks lol
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> My applications also support a myriad of military programs... Which are arguably even higher stakes. I'm pretty luke-warm about being a part of that ethically, but anything that's cool and powerful enough inevitably gets used by the military.
21:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> The space stuff is awesome though. I have some applications that create and store data such as the parts and processes used to build and maintain the International Space Station, as well as other satellites. That's fun to think about. Supporting science but also supporting war :feelsbadman:
21:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> A success story
21:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Exact same story for me, but instead I've just kept doing tw stuff completely failing college
21:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Lol
21:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I failed a couple classes in college, first couple years I was just partying and chasing girls. Then realized that I actually had to graduate to get any ROI haha.
21:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Atleast you partied. I just sat around for an entire year, followed by another year of sitting around, followed by another year of sitting around
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Passed the bare minimum required to not be kicked out at the 2nd year
21:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also passed all computer related classes, so I only have boring engineering classes left...
21:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Lol. I actually took a semester off from my university during my second year. Was pretty much failing everything so I withdrew and then changed my major to CS and came back in the Fall semester. Did the whole CS curriculum in 2.5 years and then I was out into industry ü§ôüèº
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I was studying mechanical engineering for my first 1.5 years before taking a semester off. I was just too young to focus on school I think.
21:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I should find a project where people would donate for my work and just quit uni. Just looking at this analysis book makes me pass out, there is no way I clean out 11 engineering classes this year
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Dropping out for a semester ended up being a clutch move actually, because computer science is a much better fit for me. And I think CS actually pays slightly better than ME in most places üëçüèº
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if life was that easy
21:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't really see anything I'd want to switch to tbf. I'm doing CEng at a very decent uni already. CS has even more discrete math than this (though I guess more useful math)
21:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is a guy I follow on twitter that is just developing linux kernel drivers for the new apple silicon, easily gets 5k$ on patreon
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'd kill to be paid to do reverse engineering work, or driver development
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah there is always ppl that do x, then you try it and nobody sees you
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Computer engineering is pretty cool if you like some hardware. Plus you can brag that you're a "real" engineer whereas computer science graduates are not technically "engineers" in the legal definition nor the industry definition.
21:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or the people making RPCS3, they make decent living wages making a ps3 emulator. How lucky do you need to be in life to get paid to make an emulator
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i actually dropped out from computer engineering after 1 year, im instead doing a similar oficial thingy that gets me jobs anyway, i enjoy programming but uni rly made me want to die
21:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:sadSnail:785072987815804929>
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> But I remember taking statics and dynamics during my freshman year of engineering college. Those two classes were enough to scare away lots of students haha. Kind of a different way of thinking that you don't see often in CS but you see all the time in engineering
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Hi, I think I need some help, I am out of ideas.
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So, I am searching the cause for a crashbug, which is very weird in my opinion.
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> So the crash happens here: https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/F-DDrace/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L1463
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I checked what exactly causes it and it seemed to be this line: https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/commit/989e738de8e992649c4bffd703704c98047eadc5#diff-29ffe32916052e1066eed938021aadfeb29f855d7c63d9c1ca3350aceffb79f3R1465
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I dont get how that can even happen, and the aBuf variables contains completely random data after crash, probably because it hasnt finished the formatting, but idk.
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> 
21:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> The crash happens if a tee kills after a save reload, that means its a normal reload or shutdown and every player's tee is saved as a CSaveTee to a file, after reloading or server restart the tee gets its stats back. The crash doesnt happen consistently and never gave usefull information :/
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> literally the worst year of my life, idk what happened there to me, also i passed the programming related grades without batting an eye but math rly killed me xd
21:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i couldnt see myself wasting 6 years of my life, cuz i was sure iwoudlnt make it in 4 yeears
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> I checked the BT, its a normal kill using the f1 kill cmd
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its also expensive
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I retook calc2 like 3 times due to goofing off haha. I can't believe how many math classes I took over the years at university....
21:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut can you check what of this is the invalid memory access?
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i did
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> its the Server()->ClientName() as it seems
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> at least thats the line i am getting
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you could do something like `print Server()->ClientName()` in the debugger
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> then it'll tell you if that is the invalid memory reference
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think this attitude in training computer scientists and engineers is stupid. I'm qualified to code, yet I probably will never get a diploma saying that, because I'm not an engineer in the 1970s sense
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> i dont know how, we would need @ChillerDragon for that @heinrich5991
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> damn interesting convo starts but i just got into a ranked doto game
22:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 same
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i may not be able to develop a new super algorithm but i can code
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> we take real analysis 2 over here, I guess that's calculus 3 in the american sense
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <NeXus> @Ryozuki Do what makes you happy, I think you made the right decision. Its all about having references on projects and code you can show anyway to find good paid jobs
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah i also think i made the right decision
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im at my 2nd year of the thing im making
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Yeah, the whole 4-year degree thing was quite a lot of busy-work and jumping through hoops to "prove myself worthy" of the piece of paper that lets me get jobs lol. Lots of companies will hire you if you can code even without a degree, but it's hard to get your foot in the door especially at the big companies (like Boeing...)
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> next year ill be working
22:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its more programming focused
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i get top marks easily
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> im literally studying what the market wants rn
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice üôÇ
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> web android etc
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> was a hard decision tho
22:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wouldn't mind 4 years of computer science specific training. We are learning to be COMPUTER engineers, why do I need 2d projectile motion, I'm not becoming a siege engineer
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz i was with the mindset that uni was everything too
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its rly bad
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Or fluid dynamics, god damn fluid dynamics, who decided all engineers need fluid dynamics
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are no fluids in a computer
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> water cooling!
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üòõ
22:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> üòÑ
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u need to learn fluid dynamics to make a html website ofc
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> everywhere continuous non differentiable functions, just incase I want to make a fractal computer?
22:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> laplace transforms, I have never even once considered the laplace transform as an answer to any problem I've encountered
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Lol. Most of the math and theory stuff I learned at uni is pretty much "good to know" aka I never use it. But it's kinda nice to know about it at least. I will never in my life have to solve integrals by hand, so maybe doing it in college was just to build character. Like how they make the kids dig holes in the movie "Holes"
22:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> No way around it. Had to endure the misery because the end outcome seemed so good.
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> math helped at the definitely not completely constructed day 13 problem
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> üòõ
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :POGGIES:
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i need to retake aoc
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> been bussy
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I mean I know about all the math. It's not enough to know "about" it to pass a real analysis class
22:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I need to be able to prove all these weird things
22:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Proofs are annoying
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I wish I could bribe the dean to gimme a diploma
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 u just need to be rich and into politics
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I think part of the reasoning is that they want people that can stand out from the crowd. You can argue "anyone" could code a simple android app, but how many people are willing to do frustrating busy-work for 4 years while not getting paid? xD that's the guy they want to hire.
22:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> a spanish politician did that
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @YupHio I bet it has more to do with just tradition, but I guess that could be it too
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @YupHio that sounds stupid. I see no reason why a company would have that particular reason
22:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I can see the tradition argument
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I spend days stepping through assembly, is that not perseverance enough?
22:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> They should add a second way to get all the credits. If you can identify and fix any bug in AppKit you get 180 credits
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think google has an alternative hiring process
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Yeah. The 4-year degree is a big tradition thing. Shorter technical classes and certificates are becoming more popular because of that. But still, I think there is some value in the 4-year university experience. I definitely hated it when I was still working through it though. I think all engineering students hate it.
22:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> As I said I'd have no issue with a 4 year course on computer related stuff
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There is one uni in berlin that seems to have a very modern and useful curriculum, it's the only one I've seen of the kind
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> which uni?
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> CODE
22:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Many classes (at least in USA) allow you to test-out of the class if you already know the materials and don't want to do the busy work. Also, you can get credits for a class if you are doing related work as a hobby. Something to look into.
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> There are a lot of bootcamp style software engineer courses in france, etc. but this one is an actual uni
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, but it's a private uni
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ofc governments are where tradition lives
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I hear arguments against the coding bootcamps sometimes. Something something you can't absorb it all in less than 4 years. Lol
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> do you know how much you have to pay?
22:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> no matter how progressive, governments profit from keeping the status quo
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 they have great payment plans, you only pay after you graduate
22:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm. do you have to pay interest? when is it due?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it would be bad if you'd have a lot of debt after studying
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh apparently you can also pay it all up front, 32k euro
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ok, doesn't sound too bad
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I thought Germany abolished tuition? Or something like that?
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 32k euro for a bachelors is chump change compared to the US unis
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @YupHio it's a private uni, they can charge. public unis don't charge (much)
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> Ah
22:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's 300‚Ç¨/semester here, and you get a ticket for public transport (but you can't opt out of that)
22:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> in italy I pay 240 euros a year
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I went to a public uni (University of Idaho) and it was pretty cheap by USA standards. I actually graduated without any debt because I worked full-time in summers and almost full-time during the school year. Taking a semester off in the middle to work full-time also helped. Lots of money still lol
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> It was about $7,000 USD per year for tuition, plus room and board and books
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> 7k$ per year sounds very decent for the US
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Are you a US Citizen or is it subsidized for all students?
22:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I got a cheap rate because I got "in-state" tuition since I lived in Idaho for more than a year before enrolling. If you enroll from out of state then it's about twice as expensive...
22:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> And yeah I'm a US citizen. I think it's actually cheaper for foreign exchange students because they are always trying to get more. Lots of different programs. I didn't qualify for any special programs or grants or scholarships, so I just paid the regular Idaho resident price.
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <YupHio> I think the best way to measure the value is to look at paying it back. For example I probably paid about $36k USD or so for all of college. Then within a year of graduation I was making more than double that much per year. So if I would have paid for the whole thing with 100% loans and debt, I could have comfortably paid it off within 1 or 2 years. I think that's the key. Any college that will take like 10 or 20 years to pay back doesn't se
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ravie writing 3k lines
22:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> @C√∏ke and I found a little issue with tune zone messages, it's impossible to use quotes inside the messages because the message will end at the opening quote of the nested quotation. This makes it impossible to for example put a bind inside a tune message, for now the best we can do is use double apostrophes instead
22:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you tried `\"`
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> doesn't seem to work
22:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ravie `tune_message 1 "abc bind x \"+fire;+jump\""`
22:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> idk what tune_message is called
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah this seems to work
22:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nice üôÇ
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> for me at least, for coke the tune message behaves slightly differently on another version
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that seems weird
22:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> what's the behavior for coke?
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> I'm able to just not put the whole message in quotes and it displays just fine, for him in that case it only does the first word
22:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, that was changed recently IIRC
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yeah thought so, but it still displays wrong for people with a slightly older client so it's not much good
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's the server version that matters
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> AFAIK
22:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> ah
22:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> well better use / anyway just to be safe since it works, thanks
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> \
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ravie> yes
22:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <C√∏ke> ok work now, thx @heinrich5991
22:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ravie it works without quotes since version 15.2
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (not telling you to do anything, I just wanted to look it up)
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.iso.org/standard/79358.html
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they published c++20 standard today
22:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> huh, no hacker news post? ^^
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Number of pages : 1853
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I'm paying them 0$ to keep me informed about such stuff
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:aPES4_Steering:751433824721961031>
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Now let's wait 5 years for any compiler to have meaningful support for it
22:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @hear
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @heinrich5991 why is the iso paid?
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> never heard of this
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's always paid
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/788523577346359297/unknown.png
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you can usually get the last draft version for free (which is essentially the same)
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> all the other C++ standards also cost a lot to read
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is it a non profit or its actually greed?
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well I doubt ISO is non profit
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> doesn't say non-profit, so I guess it's not
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> whether it's "greed" is probably subjective
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I don't like standards being behind paywalls, the ietf does much better here
22:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk why a standard would be paid
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't know why ISO is involved at all
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because people will pay and they like money? ^^
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :pepe_straight:
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well ill just use cppreference.com
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <a:sadSnail:785072987815804929>
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess it gives your standard authority if it's published at ISO
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, cppreference.com is reallly nice
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> still remember the times before that ^^
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I also refer to the latest draft
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://en.cppreference.com/w/Cppreference:Archives
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can even download it
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for offline use
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but why does ISO give any extra authenticity?
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> love them
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The C standard is ultimately written by wg14
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> well, because you convinced some standards people to publish your standard
