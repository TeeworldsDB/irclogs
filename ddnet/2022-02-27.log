00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Known issue?
00:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> no, this is not somehting that should happen
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> I guess you can see the map tomorrow ðŸ˜„
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Patiga> hmm
00:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <unique_2> he knows the map
00:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ok ðŸ˜„
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <unique_2> some envelope index was -80k. we don't know why
01:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <unique_2> some envelope index was -80k. we don't know why. but the map is fixed now

08:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> suggestion: ```css
08:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> .block2.teamranks {
08:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn>   min-width: 120px;
08:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> }```
08:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> so as to not look odd when there are no ranks for a map

08:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> without my change:
08:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/947388220612702238/unknown.png
08:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> or just provide some text there like "No ranks"
08:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> if this change is desirable i can create a PR for it
08:32 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Just finish bit3 already
08:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Im 'corneum> code anti ddos or dox the guy
09:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @lynn yes, looks a bit better, maybecan also be achieved with some padding instead. or at least use em as the unit for the min-width, not px
09:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Im 'corneum\: dox who?
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> either way doesn't matter, im just worried with padding it will affect the normal view
09:18 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> im not sure if em or px is standard for the css there
09:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> we try to use em instead px
09:33 <+Konsti> good morning fellow nobies
10:04  * Konsti slaps Ryozuki- around a bit with a large fishbot
10:05 <+Konsti> @Ryozuki hentai? :justatest:
11:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Wohoo> @deen you are always on the cutting edge ðŸ™‚
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1645971069.png
15:11 <+ChillerDragon> ETA?
15:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @deen you broke t0
15:38 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> we get spammed with "you cannot finish anymore"
15:42 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> oops
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> Hey guys, what do you think about having CTF maps as part of the map pool for DDRace? One flag to the other -- some new code would be necessary, so just doing some interest check from the devs
15:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> Basically a Teerace, and having all the CTF/Race maps in the DDRace map pool
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FLARE> Hi guys
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FLARE> Can someone test my first game? :)
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FLARE> https://bit.ly/Skyblade
16:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <FLARE> password: test
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> Fastcap in ddrace basically?
17:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> Yep
17:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unique servers have fastcap, I think
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm not sure I want ddnet to just absorb another gamemode, especially with the way the code is set up we can't even isolate the gamemodes from one another
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye unique has fastcap
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u even have ranks https://uniqueclan.net/ranks#fastcap
17:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> Yeah but DDNet servers are more ubiquitous
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I don't mind it in principle btw, I'm just not sure how much more code it'd be that might make maintainance more annoying
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> add more dead gamemodes xd
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> where are you missing a unique server? NA?
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> If only tw had a proper way to isolate mods
17:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> Korea/Japan/Singapore
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> FastCap
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> r u the old pathos or a new pathos?
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> meh, sounds like it's better suited to be done by unique
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> I've been Pathos for several years :D I'm not sure
17:07 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> have you tried asking them for korea/japan/singapore servers?
17:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> Nope, though DDNet already has servers there
17:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes, but such a monopoly is bad, and you make it worse by absorbing other projects IMO
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> I mean, if it's bad, then someone will fork I think
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it's hard to fork and you make it harder by making it bigger
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> don't you think the above statement is true?
17:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> The original FastCap is the fork, it already exists
17:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I mean that it gets harder to host your own fastcap servers and get players on them if ddnet has some
17:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> because people will be disconnected from "the official point system", e.g.
17:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> Well, doesn't matter how it's achieved code wise, just want Korea/Japan/Singapore servers
17:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> could you ask unique? ^^
17:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> Though I do think that a centralised system for points would be nice, but I didn't know that Unique servers would still be up
17:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I'm not really talking about the code, more about who hosts it)
17:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> Oh Ryozuki
17:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Pathos> Thanks, Ryozuki led me to Timakro
17:23 <+ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 wake
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> for such a large value i think em is meaningless unless you're doing padding instead of min-width tho
19:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <lynn> it should probably be padding tho
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> em is better
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its relative to font size
20:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so its more responsive
20:29 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> not like that page is the most responsive one xd
21:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jore> @deen (sorry in advance for the ping) https://discord.com/channels/252358080522747904/342454474117218334/934219067206819850
21:19 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jore> I seem to have something similar; so far i have noticed it wont happen in windowed mode - or my preferred fix is to unlock refresh rate in fullscreen. I'd love to limit my fps but whenever i do so, the fps drops return
22:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nagi01 {LAN}> yo, anyone know how to parse an ar archive ?
