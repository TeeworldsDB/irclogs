00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> someone should open an issue about this or it will be forgotten
00:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> that shouldn't have been merged to begin with if it didn't properly address the issue, especially when the proper fix isn't too too hard...
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> i would like a thing that tells you how much you've been playing in game in total and in game including main screen
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Alexander> in settings or somewhere
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <jao> yea that's way more interesting
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i tested it and ist was properly fixed for me and i donâ€™t think that my Skill allows me to implement a better crc Check
00:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> Nobody Else does it and we loose Demos as Long as this bug exist and Nobody knows if we can get them back ðŸ˜¦
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki the code for uuid handling in maps looks wrong
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen pls rls new one when bors gets off his ass and merges #1772
00:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> the IDs for AUTOMAPPER_CONFIG and TEST  can change
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye i didnt add uuid logic
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u mean my code
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i was just testing a bit
00:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> this means that if we add more UUID objects, these IDs (65534) will change
00:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (so the code will not handle future maps correctly)
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yea i plan on adding uuid support for my code
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but its a bit confusing idk
00:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and as u make casts from citem to citemex it makes it difficult
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on non c languages
00:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> need to figure out how to do it xD
00:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Alexander that shouldn't be hard to make
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki `CItemEx` is an array of 4 integers, you can treat it as such
00:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ok
02:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> I only re-opened it because I wanted to investigate aswell and didn't want to forget about it
02:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> It just sounds insane to me that we can't render a tile based game perfectly in 2019, especially with fairly recent hardware, not like we are trying to render on a decade old gpu or sth
02:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> well AMD Vega can do it
02:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i have 0 bugs
02:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and 6k FPS XD
02:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah and NVIDIA seemed to changed something in their drivers since RTX
02:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs my old gtx 760 always worked
02:12 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> we should atleast make the high quality textures setting useless when opengl is enabled, as it causes tearing a 100% of the time
02:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> either that or i allow the shaders to specify the texture size
02:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then in theory it's possible to also use higher resolution textures some day
08:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> @Ryozuki there is any less cancerous ways to make less lines on it and get the same result? it's attached to a hitbox that i tried to replicate based on tee movements
08:20 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/588975934825299968/unknown.png
08:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> (its gdscript btw who doesnt know wth is this)
09:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> Lol that thing time played sucks.
10:05 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Cellegen> i just wanted it to be shorter, so later on i can modify the speed as i may like it
11:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Natzer> Use Switch case
11:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @n000b indeed
11:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @deen i think we should revert the PLAYED thing
11:59 <@deen> ok
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> If you want to monitor it do it in f1
13:23 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <n000b> I don't want extra useless stuff in there
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> yay more space in the uster interface ðŸ˜ƒ
13:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> poor sirius
14:45 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> xD
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > Debian Buster will be released on 2019-07-06
17:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :o
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> arch > debian
17:58 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> #actingLikeIknowShitAboutArchLinuxLol

19:39 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <ChillerDragon> haha im arch user :troll:
21:26 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 i have added the pull request from you to my mod, and the `GAMEINFOFLAG_ALLOW_ZOOM` doesnt work. zoom will be possible even though it is not sent by the server
21:28 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> yes, my client is up to date
21:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> it does not seem to work for any of those, except time score
21:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i mean client side u can code it to ignore the gameinfo ofc
21:51 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Why isnt this completed?
21:56 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> eyewheel doesnt work aswell
