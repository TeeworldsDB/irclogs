00:00 <+bridge_> [freenode] <breton> DDNet 9.0.2
00:00 <+bridge_> [freenode] <breton> 2015-08-28
00:00 <+bridge_> [freenode] <breton> jeez
00:01 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <louis> i think the mod was made a long time ago
00:06 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> No surprise, Headshot even ran Teeworlds on Win98: https://funkyimg.com/i/2CegT.bmp
00:08 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> swap seems completely broken :/
00:11 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> how so?
00:16 <+bridge_> [freenode] <breton> the mod was made a long time ago and was unpublished until recently?
00:17 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Headshot question for you ^
00:20 <+bridge_> [freenode] <breton> oh hi Headshot (user list is scarce in freenode)
00:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> Yeah, most are on Discord (~5500 people)
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> @deen it kept just timing out
00:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> so weird
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> ehm, that's how I disabled it, see #announcements
00:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> there is no other way to turn it off i think
00:46 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Headshot> i started this mod around 2018 when i was still using ddnet 9 on a windows xp 512mb ram box
00:47 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Headshot> i had not really found much motivation to work on it as much as i do now
00:57 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> oh I see, meh confusing but it does work to disable yeah
06:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <TsFreddie (CHN Community Repost)> https://guthib.com/
08:52 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oh yikes gnome update
08:52 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> time to switch DE
09:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont use gnome
09:05 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> yea i really dislike the new look so i need something new i guess
09:05 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> maybe KDE :D
09:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dont use kde either
09:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they signed the letter against rms
09:13 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they are corporate shills
09:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and gnome created it
09:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> sadly there is also a arch linux maintainer in there sadge
09:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think i may switch to gentoo
09:35 <+Ryozuki> ChillerDragon https://web.archive.org/web/20200607212123/http://techrights.org/2020/06/07/gnome-board-of-directors-2020/
09:35 <+Ryozuki> gnome + microsoft = <3
09:39 <+bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> So what should I use then?
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nooback> swap is broken
11:30 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nooback> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/829649374278713375/unknown.png
11:31 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nooback> somehow it takes your cooldown when the guy you want to swap with uses it later
11:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> Read #announcements please. We've disabled the swap function due to exploits
11:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nooback> Ik it still works
11:33 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nooback> @murpi
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> we're aware of this aswell, don't spread it though
11:34 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nooback> well I thought its enabled again, but idk
11:35 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <murpi> we'll make an annoucement after the issue has been resolved
11:36 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Nooback> ok then, just the cooldown now is broken sometimes
13:00 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> One of us?
13:02 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Learath2> chilledragon: have you tried using a WM instead of a full DE? I've been so happy with both i3 and bspwm for the last 7 years

19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> @Headshot  you who make the game like fall guys XD?
19:37 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> i i suggesting putting sign above The player who has highest scores
19:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <hussainx3> to be clear and easier  block him :feelsamazingman:
21:24 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Boti.> Maybe set their clan the Same as their score
21:25 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Boti.> A longer Simon says would be Great , more cows to make that one easier
22:03 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> im starting lurking for econ-related information, can anyone share useful links before i will start?
22:14 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @gerdoe i think econ is just telnet
22:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or what do u mean
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> does server send commands that person can use on it to econ user?
22:21 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> does server send commands which person can use on it to econ user?
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no
22:40 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you get the messages the server gets, and you can enter rcon commands
22:49 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Index> @Ryozuki gogo, change now!))

22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and i can't request for command list?
22:53 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> and i can't make request for command list?
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> only if there's an rcon command for this
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> maybe cmdlist or so, idk
22:54 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <gerdoe> eh
23:04 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> @Index good luck with replacing those fans ðŸ˜„
23:09 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyone tried the wuffs language? ðŸ™‚
23:10 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i saw it on hn
23:15 <+bridge_> [ddnet] <deen> no allocations sounds restrictive in use
