00:29 < xrothx> deen:  you got a moment? 
00:29 <@deen> xrothx: yes?
00:30 < xrothx> after nearly a whole day mapping & testing 1st. I realized it was way harder to make it perfect as all testers like :o
00:30 < xrothx> 2nd. its done! 
00:30 < xrothx> Can you upload the new map to the map directory of the blockserver?
00:31 < xrothx> #2
00:31 < xrothx> I can send it in a mail
00:32 <@deen> nono, just upload it on test server and tell me the file name
00:34 <@deen> and since it's not your map, what did you change and is it ok with bip?
00:35 < xrothx> Left bip in credits
00:35 < xrothx> you can see it
00:35 < xrothx> also thanked ddnet.tw & welf
00:35 <@deen> i don't know the old map version
00:35 < xrothx> welf is your tester, I like him. He made the background
00:35 <@deen> hm, i don't know if you should just take someone else's map and change it without permission
00:36 < xrothx> I know him
00:36 < xrothx> He doesn't mind lol
00:36 <@deen> ok
00:36 < xrothx> He made the map 2-3years ago,
00:36 < xrothx> was the most popular (after mine :) blmapNEW_upgrades.. But I lost my client to map it & can't edit it anymore
00:36 < xrothx> blmapV3ROYAL
00:36 < xrothx> don't restart the server yet
00:37 < xrothx> I will do it later today 
00:37 <@deen> hm, it's risky
00:37 <@deen> when you have a popular server running like this and just change something
00:37 <@deen> might go wrong and all the players run away
00:38 < xrothx> pretty sure it won't happen
00:38 <@deen> i see different start and background. anything else?
00:38 < xrothx> Since I asked over 10 players there opinion
00:38 < xrothx> I only edited what people suggested.
00:38 < xrothx> & its tested by racers, noobs and blockers :)
00:38 < savander-androi> Ggg:-)
00:38 < xrothx> all happy with it
00:38 <@deen> xrothx: ok, I'm adding it now
00:39 < xrothx> Aight thanks :) 
00:39 < savander-androi> Deen servers empty you can restart :D
00:40 <@deen> xrothx: can i change map in chile?
00:41 <@deen> savander-androi: i think you broke something
00:41 <@deen> savander-androi: i type /top5 and the server segfaults^^
00:41 < savander-androi> Woah?
00:41 < savander-androi> You compile it
00:41 < xrothx> yes sure
00:41 < savander-androi> Sql_release?
00:42 < savander-androi> I added only
00:42 < xrothx> deen:  And tell me what you don't like about the ger servers? 
00:42 <@deen> and your grammar is bad again, you didn't fix my changes back
00:42 < savander-androi> If definr
00:42 < savander-androi> Define sql
00:42 <@deen> savander-androi: it only crashes in chile, not in germany
00:42 < savander-androi> :o
00:42 < xrothx> because I might find a way to find another dedi server ddos safe up to 30gbit in frankfurt
00:43 < savander-androi> I dont know theb
00:43 < savander-androi> Then why
00:43 < savander-androi> I didnr add smth else
00:44 < xrothx> deen:  the map is in the directory now right? So I can start a vote? 
00:44 < savander-androi> Any else*
00:46 <@deen> xrothx: yes
00:46 <@deen> savander-androi: ah shit, i know why!
00:47 <@deen> savander-androi: when sql connection doesn't work, it segfaults
00:47 <@deen> needs to be fixed^^
00:50 < savander-androi> I thought
00:50 < savander-androi> I did it
00:50 < savander-androi> Lol
00:50 <@deen> you do it tomorrow, ok?
00:51 < savander-androi> Mhm :)
00:51 < savander-androi> Im not on computer
00:51 < savander-androi> Right now
00:51 < savander-androi> :pp
00:51 <@deen> so that's why chile zcatch was empty now^^
00:52 < savander-androi> but still weitd
00:52 < savander-androi> Because
00:52 < savander-androi> U tested it
00:52 <@deen> i made a mistake with password on chile
00:52 <@deen> that's why they couldn't log in anymore
00:52 < savander-androi> And i forgot once
00:52 <@deen> but should still not sergfault
00:52 <@deen> -r
00:52 < savander-androi> Setvpassword to mysql
00:52 < savander-androi> Soo i run servet
00:53 < savander-androi> Without connection to mysql
00:53 < savander-androi> And it worked
00:53 < savander-androi> Didnt have any sergfault
00:53 < savander-androi> Command didnt it too lol
00:54 < savander-androi> Maybe i changed something
00:54 < savander-androi> Dont know xD
00:59 < Nimda> Yumizo by Ezio & Kayumi just released on Brutal at 2014-11-08 00:56
01:01 <@deen> xrothx: you forgot to add jetpack weapon at end and music!
01:02 < xrothx> deen:  jetpack in a blockmap? :P hahah
01:02 < xrothx> and the music, explain me :D ^^^^
01:03 <@deen> xrothx: yeah, jetpack and superjump would be fun
01:03 < xrothx> deen:  You can take the map and add music if you want ? :D
01:03 <@deen> yes
01:10 < xrothx> laggs
01:11 < xrothx> 2 different attacks on 10 min
01:25 <@deen> xrothx: oh, big lags?
01:28 <@deen> attack still ongoing
01:33 < xrothx> yes
01:33 < xrothx> But filtered
01:33 < xrothx> I don't see anything 
01:33 <@deen> yeah, looks good now. i like their protection
01:35 < xrothx> deen:  please.. fix the fake problem 
01:35 < xrothx> I hate those fakers.. :(
01:35 <@deen> it's a dns amplification attack, but the source ports seem weird
01:35 < xrothx> They come back xRoThx  : I m gay
01:35 < xrothx> ... 
01:35 <@deen> xrothx: hm, how to solve it?
01:35 <@deen> i don't know how it works, maybe someone else here knows
01:37 < xrothx> couldn't you read what char it is? 
01:37 < xrothx> And make a system to ban an ip range
01:37 <@deen> sounds like a lot of work
01:37 <@deen> There are many ways of faking, so i don't know
01:38 <@deen> apparently there is a way to get the exact same name someone has
01:38 <@deen> then you can just use similar characters, like cyrillic e and latin e
01:38 <@deen> or invisible characters like spaces
01:38 <@deen> considering the size of unicode this is quite a big problem
01:38 <@deen> i can understand why vanilla went back to ascii only names
01:39 < xrothx> why don't you do so? 
01:39 <@deen> many many people don't have ascii names
01:39 <@deen> should we force every russian player to use an ascii name for example?
01:40 < xrothx> Hm... 
01:40 < xrothx> thats shitty..Âµ
01:40 <@deen> it would break the names of many of our players, they would hate it
01:40 <@deen> see here: http://ddnet.tw/ranks/
02:20 < Avaron> Hello! deen are you here?
02:20 <@deen> hi Avaron 
02:21 < Avaron> Me and Rashu have map for DDNet
02:21 < Avaron> First ;p
02:23 <@deen> ok, cool
02:24 <@deen> Avaron: are you the avaron who made ddmax maps back 2 years ago?
02:24 <@deen> or maybe 3 years
02:24 < Avaron> yup
02:24 <@deen> nice, i really liked one of your maps
02:24 < Avaron> hehe, thanks you ;)
02:25 <@deen> Evo 1 it was!
02:25 <@deen> Anyway, what's the question?^^
02:28 < Avaron> We made the map its finished, i didn't read the rules ;> and question is what we should fallow to upload map?
02:31 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/rules
02:31 <@deen> Basically when everything is done and tested, you make a thread here: http://forum.ddnet.tw/viewforum.php?f=9
02:32 <@deen> testers then take a look at the map and report back if anything needs to be changed (always)
02:43 < xrothx> deen: 
02:43 < xrothx> You here
02:43 < xrothx> You here?
02:44 <@deen> yes?
02:45 < Avaron> Okey, we will fallow this ;) thanks you
02:51 < xrothx> deen:  please.. Don't care how but find a way to fix the fakers
02:51 < xrothx> its too anoying
03:00 < xrothx> deen: any way to ban an ip range? 
06:12 < laxadedi> Hey hey

11:22 < Nimda> Translation: This
12:08 < xRoThx> deen:  We have a mixed public. I have new players that I have never seen. And they are all positive. And we also have the players that don't want any change on the original
12:08 < xRoThx> deen:  So I have an idea. The edited map. We call it blmapV3ROYAL2 
12:08 < xRoThx> deen:  And we also host the original
12:09 < xRoThx> That way we have a bigger public :)
12:37 <@deen> xRoThx: have the old map version anywhere then?
12:37 <@deen> !ddnetpeak

12:48 <@deen> hi Savander 
12:48 < Savander> hi! :)
12:51 <@deen> xRoThx: scratch that, found it
12:54 <@deen> xRoThx: made a new server run with the old map version
12:57 < Savander> wtf
13:02 < Savander> deen:  here is the error https://github.com/savander/zcatch/blob/zCatch/src/game/server/ranking.cpp#L77
13:02 < Savander> but  why?xD
13:02 < Savander> I catch the exception..
13:03 <@deen> m_pDatabase is 0
13:03 <@deen> or m_pConnection is 0
13:03 <@deen> i had many of these issues in ddnet^
13:03 < Savander> 	if(pData->m_pSqlData->Connect())
13:04 < Savander> below in rank and team
13:04 < Savander> it should work i guess?
13:05 <@deen> let me see if i can fix it
13:06 <@deen> xRoThx: as i said, it's difficult to change something when a community is used to it
13:08 < xRoThx> yes.. :(
13:08 < xRoThx> A lot of likers though.. 
13:08 < xRoThx> But I think the choice of a map is made by the players online
13:08 < xRoThx> If I come on a good map without players I leave
13:08 < xRoThx> I rather going on a full shitty map
13:12 <@deen> Savander: ok, fixed
13:12 <@deen> Savander: as i remembered, i had the same issue in ddnet, same fix works
13:15 < Savander> ahm
13:16 < Savander> I wouldn't know :<
13:22 < xRoThx> deen:  What is the limit of players possible? 
13:22 < xRoThx> Because I am pretty sure I could be able to make an all-in map
13:22 < xRoThx> all best maps in 1 map
13:22 < xRoThx> And players choose the map @ start with teleports
13:23 < xRoThx> will get all blockservers in 1. Will get 100-300 players on itself :P
13:23 < Savander> TeeVision and DDNet has all players :D
13:23 < Savander> on zCatch  :>>
13:24 < xRoThx> teevision isn't ddos protected so doesn't count for me
13:24 < xRoThx> and DDNet is the best <3 )
13:24 < Savander> i like TeeVision
13:24 < Savander> nobody want to attack them..
13:25 < xRoThx> I like it also. Marius hosted my irst server
13:25 < Savander>  because they only zCatch :P
13:26 < Savander> 2 years later
13:26 < Savander> DDNet.tw -> Servers provider
13:26 < Savander> With big community from TeeWorlds :P
13:26 < xRoThx> ddnet doesn't sell servers yet
13:27 < xRoThx> deen:  it might be an idea
13:27 < Savander> ehm, i know?
13:27 < xRoThx> deen:  That we discuss about the total server cost
13:27 < Savander> just joking, teeVision sells teeworlds servers ;p
13:33 < xRoThx> deen:  We could calculate the server costs. And what 1 server cost and ask for example 2â¬/month hosted on our servers without any guarantee
13:34 < xRoThx> Or we create servers but they have to donate. Doesn't matter what. Even 10cent is good. But every edit will require a donatino
14:04 <@EastByte> a tw server isn't worth 10cent
14:05 <@EastByte> and we still have enough servers :P
14:11 < xRoThx> EastByte:  What do you think the realy costs are for a 64players teeworlds server with ddos protection
14:12 <@EastByte> I can't answer that
14:12 <@EastByte> 64pl are like 4mbit/s traffic
14:13 <@EastByte> and if you have a server with good protection you can use it to host thousands of tw servers
14:14 <@EastByte> the servers would get more expensive if the number of players raises
14:14 <@EastByte> maybe by a factor of 10 or so :P
14:14 < Savander> cpu :<
14:15 <@EastByte> empty servers should be 0% cpu
14:15 < xRoThx> EastByte:  I am hesitating for this:
14:16 < xRoThx> Xeon 2xE5530
14:16 < xRoThx> 24 Gb ram
14:16 < xRoThx> 8cores, HT
14:16 < xRoThx> so 16
14:17 < Savander> 2000 servers
14:17 < xRoThx> but it only has 100mbit
14:17 < xRoThx> I don't like that:(
14:17 < Savander> on it 1000players
14:17 < Savander> woah :<.
14:17 <@EastByte> xRoThx: see
14:17 < xRoThx> I try to convince the hosting to make me 1gbit :D
14:17 < xRoThx> ^^
14:17 <@EastByte> 1gbit isn't enough either
14:17 <@EastByte> just buy a bunch of cheap servers
14:18 <@EastByte> 20 server = 20 * 100mbit
14:18 < xRoThx> ^^
14:18 <@EastByte> you will _never_ be able to use the resources using tw servers
14:18 < xRoThx> That was my idea once the webinterface is done.. ^^
14:18 < xRoThx> To make people choose there prefered host
14:18 < xRoThx> They can choose the country & location etc
14:19 < xRoThx> :)
14:23 <@EastByte> yea a project like this is fun to work on
14:23 <@EastByte> but you won't have enough customers
14:27 < xRoThx> Its more for fun then for money
14:27 < xRoThx> The little money I earn with that would hopefully be motivating enough to keep on going ^^^
14:32 < xRoThx> http://www.kimsufi.com/fr/index.xml 
14:32 < xRoThx> those are intresting
14:32 <@EastByte> nah, not worth for tw
14:32 <@EastByte> the problem is you can't select the location buying a kimsufi
14:32 < xRoThx> :o
14:33 < xRoThx> Why not? 
14:33 <@EastByte> because they are cheap?!
14:33 <@EastByte> meant to be used by private people
14:34 < xRoThx> aight
14:34 < xRoThx> EastByte:  What do you propose? 
14:34 <@EastByte> the cloud vps in strabourg seems to be the cheapest/best solution at ovh
14:34 <@EastByte> for german playeres atleast
14:35 < Savander> http://www.dedify.com/
14:35 < xRoThx>  I have that one cloud 3
14:35 < xRoThx> + the nfo server
14:39 < xRoThx> In frankfÃ¼rt there is a data center. Where you can rent a dedi with 8gb, i7 quad core. and secured up to 30gbit/s
14:39 < xRoThx> A friend of mine (owner of the candys clan) Is now testing it 
14:40 < ochristi> "up to"
14:41 < xRoThx> yes
14:42 < ochristi> how will he even test that? :D
14:42 < xRoThx> No idea
14:50 < xRoThx> isn't it a good idea to take a gameserver? 
14:51 < xRoThx> http://www.soyoustart.com/nl/betas/game-servers/
14:51 < xRoThx> its only for 14days
14:51 < xRoThx> but after that It can be reordered
14:51 <@EastByte> not sure whether you are able to choose the location there
14:51 < xRoThx> If deen  can just make a backup :)
14:51 < xRoThx> It will give us a new ip ever 14days
14:51 < xRoThx> So :)
14:51 <@EastByte> you also get 16 ips free there
15:18 <@deen> xRoThx: sorry, i'm not interested in making money with ddnet or with hosting servers for other people
15:18 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
15:18 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 422
15:18 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
15:19 <@EastByte> wow I opened up a ticket at ovh three days before and they didn't respond yet
15:20 < xRoThx> EastByte:  Didn't got any response neither 2days :P
15:20 < xRoThx> ^^
15:20 <@deen> EastByte: yeah, that's how i know them as well^^
15:20 < xRoThx> deen:  It would cover the costs for a part
15:21 <@deen> xRoThx: i really don't want to work on the problems paying people have
15:22 <@deen> I'm running ddnet because it's fun. some side-projects get hosted as well if other people take care of the servers. but that's all i want, nothing more
15:27 <@deen> !ddnetpeak
15:27 < Nimda> Current players on DDNet : 458
15:27 < Nimda> Current DDNet peak : 612 users online at 2014-10-26 20:15:01
15:34 <@deen> xRoThx: player limit per tw server is 64, increasing it is probably not a good idea for many reasons
15:35 <@deen> xRoThx: on the ddnet GER server (yours) i would expect 1000 players to work without lags
15:37 < Savander> bye]
15:37 <@EastByte> hmm I think kimsufi servers are really suitable for games like minecraft
15:37 <@EastByte> so damn cheap
15:39 <@deen> yes, and ping doesn't matter much for minecraft i guess
15:40 <@EastByte> and many other games except tw :P
15:40 < xRoThx> Okay
15:40 <@deen> xRoThx: http://ddnet.tw is currently on kimsufi
15:41 < xRoThx> But deen  The problems for you & others with nfo, how to fix it? 
15:41 <@deen> but i want to move it somewhere else, just have to find something cheap and good =/
15:41 < xRoThx> alright, And why not any server?
15:41 <@deen> i want it to keep running for a few years without having to move it again
15:41 <@deen> don't like work
15:41 < xRoThx> :P
15:41 <@EastByte> deen doesn't like work you see?
15:42 < xRoThx> A little lazy? 
15:42 <@deen> xRoThx: some problems are because of internap's routing. i tell people to report their routing problems directly to nfoservers, so they can try to fix it
15:42 < xRoThx> Okay
15:42 <@deen> xRoThx: my personal problem is just because Deutsche Telekom is shitty, nothing can be done. I always see a few other players on server affected by it, but can't do anything about it.
15:42 <@deen> since EastByte wants to keep EUR running, they have an alternative
15:43 <@EastByte> I do?
15:43 <@deen> I thought you said so^^
15:43 <@EastByte> yea I wanted to but I told you it is going to run out^^
15:44 <@EastByte> and you said you wanted to take all servers in europe down except nfoservers
15:44 <@deen> yes, that would be the long term goal
15:45 <@EastByte> so should I extend it or do you want to switch to xRothx's vps cloud?
15:46 <@deen> i don't know. it seems popular with the players
15:46 <@EastByte> yea maybe the two ips are popular
15:46 <@EastByte> I'll extend it another month
15:47 <@deen> you 2 are the ones who want to buy servers all the time, you should find a solution
15:47 <@EastByte> haha
15:47 <@EastByte> ovh strabourg was my end solution
15:49 <@EastByte> btw. the 37.* ip has permanent mitigation enabled and the 92.* not
15:49 <@EastByte> but the quality seems to be the same on both
15:49 <@EastByte> ovh's fallback ips are really cool
15:49 <@EastByte> you can park and switch them between servers
15:50 <@deen> if you want to keep running that server that's great with me
15:50 <@deen> I'm just worried that it's all expensive
15:50 <@EastByte> 12 eur isn't expensive for me
15:51 <@EastByte> and I like to analyse/fight ddos attacks so it's fun^^
15:51 <@deen> great
15:53 <@deen> xRoThx: nfoservers is pretty new in Germany, so i hope these are issues that can be solved eventually
15:55 < xRoThx> EastByte:  I have strasbourg cloud 3 for the webinterface & nfoservers
15:55 < xRoThx> nfo is for ddnet 
15:56 < xRoThx> its all good for me D
16:14 < xRoThx> So exept ovh & nfo there are no good & cheap hosters? 
16:15 <@EastByte> well does "good" include ddos protection?
16:15 <@EastByte> anti ddos always is a problematic topic
16:16 < xRoThx> yes including ddos protection
16:17 <@deen> not that i know of, if you find any, please let us know, xRoThx 
16:18 <@EastByte> http://teeserver.de/ 2 days left
16:18 <@EastByte> I caught G@mer decreasing the counter by ~10 days :D

16:19 < xRoThx> monday 20h
16:19 < xRoThx> ;)
17:59 < xRoThx> deen: 
17:59 <@deen> xRoThx: yes?
18:00 < xRoThx> I get congratz from people on skype. They say I should be proud with a full 64/64 server
18:00 < xRoThx> Wanted to share with you ;)
18:00 <@deen> nice
18:00 < xRoThx> Its soo full that they even start filling the ROYAL2 :P
18:00 <@deen> nope, they were filling royal2 before it was full ;)
18:00 <@deen> i saw 54 on 1 and 20 on 2
18:01 < xRoThx> oh, missed that out I guess :)

18:01 <@deen> cpu load of a full blocker server: 17%
18:01 <@deen> (of a single core)
18:01 < xRoThx> :o
18:02 <@deen> some maps cause higher cpu load, like joyride, where you move at very high speeds
18:02 < NICOS> deen
18:02 <@deen> and send thousands of pistol shots^^
18:02 <@deen> NICOS: yes?
18:02 < NICOS> i found a bug in EASY 1
18:02 < NICOS> i just reported it on ddracenetwr
18:02 < NICOS> work*
18:02 < xRoThx> deen: But the current host of nfo is good enough?
18:03 < xRoThx> deen:  I concider buying a dedicated server and make virtual machines of it
18:03 < NICOS> coool
18:03 < xRoThx> in FrankFÃ¼rt
18:03 <@deen> NICOS: as Lady Saavik said, please make a screenshot instead of demo
18:03 < NICOS> its a moviment bug
18:03 < NICOS> i can't
18:03 <@deen> xRoThx: it's totally fine for the foreseeable time
18:04 <@deen> NICOS: that's not a bug
18:04 < NICOS> why? xD it is.. you can cheat...
18:04 <@deen> it's a shortcut
18:04 < NICOS> you gain time if you do it like this
18:04 <@deen> every map has shortcuts
18:04 < NICOS> ok... 
18:04 < NICOS> lol
18:04 < NICOS> gonna do the map...
18:04 < NICOS> W EASY 1!
18:05 <@deen> and when you find a bug, it's enough to make a forum thread. no need to send me a PM and write in irc as well
18:05 < xRoThx> deen:  Is it possible to make a peak for ger only
18:05 <@deen> xRoThx: laxadedi wrote !ddnetpeak, but he's busy meeting girls from teeworlds
18:09 < xRoThx> lol? 
18:10 < xRoThx> deen:  Can you open another server with V3ROYAL. Just had a vote and it passed to open a 2nd ROYAL (original)
18:10 <@deen> xRoThx: sure
18:10 < xRoThx> port? 
18:10 <@deen> 8208
18:10 < xRoThx> ok thx

18:14 < xRoThx> shit
18:14 < xRoThx> :p
18:16 < xRoThx> lmao keeps on being full
18:16 < xRoThx> I should really open my blmapNEW server again.. :
18:17 < xRoThx> deen:  Can you unlock it when it has been protected with a special client? 4digit lock :)
18:18 <@deen> no idea what that is or how it works
18:19 <@deen> but if someone makes that then that person clearly doesn't want you to edit the map, so i won't help you with that
18:20 < savander-androi> Hi. :)
18:20 <@deen> hi savander-androi 
18:23 < xRoThx> I protected it myself lol
18:23 < xRoThx> I used to have to client 
18:24 < xRoThx> its free
18:24 < xRoThx> but can't  find it anymore
18:24 <@deen> ^^
18:24 < xRoThx> I still know my pin (2580)

19:07 < xRoThx> not that dum
19:07 < xRoThx> *dumb
19:11 < savander> deen: 
19:11 < xRoThx> got it
19:11 < xRoThx> Will be mapping tomorrow/day after ;)
19:11 < savander> you didn't add info msg to zcatch?
19:11 < xRoThx> and protect my maps again
19:12 < savander> and you didn't add any commands
19:12 < savander> for moderator :<
19:46 <@deen> savander: i think i did but maybe it didn't work
19:49 <@deen> savander: you can try setting the stuff directly in rcon, if you find out how it works, give me the lines
19:49 <@deen> i have stuff like:
19:49 <@deen> mod_command status 1
19:49 <@deen> add_info "Visit our website: ddnet.tw"
19:59 <@deen> xRoThx: wait, you're working with the guys who create the ddrace bots?

20:14 < ddnet-commits> [ddnet] def- pushed 1 new commit to DDRace64: http://git.io/UhCIkQ
20:14 < ddnet-commits> ddnet/DDRace64 bc9d632 def: Clean up whitespace detection a bit and add BRAILLE PATTERN BLANK (U+2800)
20:14 <@deen> xRoThx: that should be the fix for the guy who was faking you
20:14 <@deen> haven't restarted servers yet
20:25 < xRoThx> Thanks deen  
20:25 < xRoThx> And I used to work with those coders
20:25 < xRoThx> Now they have notting left. bunch of traitors. Its tempting to ban them from ROYAL
20:25 < xRoThx> They play there a lot
20:26 <@deen> hm, real bans are not something we usually do at ddnet
20:26 <@deen> i only do 5 min bans for botting recently
20:26 < xRoThx> Nop
20:26 <@heinrich5991> that's very nice :)
20:28 < xRoThx> I first mute
20:28 < xRoThx> For faking I ask multiple times to stop
20:28 < xRoThx> Then I kick them
20:28 < xRoThx> up to 3times
20:28 < xRoThx> Then I ban then for like 5minutes
20:29 < xRoThx> And if they keep coming back sooner and keep faking (like yesterday) I ban for life
20:29 < xRoThx> But life is for them 3minutes or so, the time they change proxy.. 
20:30 <@deen> not everyone can do that
20:34 <@heinrich5991> xRoThx: ban for life for faking?
20:39 <@EastByte> "life" means one day in the virtual world :)
20:42 <@deen> xRoThx: for the status you can just look at http://ddnet.tw/status btw
20:45 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: for people with dynamic IP.. and if that's the case, why not ban for one day?
20:55 <@EastByte> ddos eur
21:21 <@deen> ping went up pretty much during ddos
21:21 <@EastByte> yea
21:22 <@EastByte> mitigation has been enabled
21:22 <@EastByte> I'm not sure whether 37. has been attacked too
21:38 <@EastByte> deen: btw. it was ssdp reflection again (5. and 8. November)
21:39 <@deen> seems like they're ddosing GER as well
22:08 < xrothx> I don't get it.. 
22:08 < xrothx> They know it is DDoS protected, but they keep trying! --'
22:09 <@deen> nothing is 100% protected
22:10 <@EastByte> and they still can improve their attacks
22:11 <@EastByte> we already had ip spoofed ddos attacks
22:11 <@EastByte> a little bit tweaking and they are unblockable
23:08 < laxadedi> Oh man, germany is quite fucked up country from what I've already seen xD
23:08 < laxadedi> I had to pay in Koln just to pee...
23:09 <@EastByte> haha
23:10 < eeeee> german beer is so good you have to pay for it twice ^^
23:10 < laxadedi> yes... that
23:10 < laxadedi> that's why it's so cheap compared to france
23:12 < laxadedi> Good thing is, for a meal that would cost you like 10 euros in France, you would pay like 8 euros in germany
23:12 < laxadedi> so I guess the good is cheaper
