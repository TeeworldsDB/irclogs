00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> anyway, I'm out. good night 🙂

02:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <RECTHOR> Hello, I have set up a ddrace server on a virtual server. But map records are not showing, how can I fix this?
09:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> The official ddnet ranks only work on servers that we are running. If you run your own server the finishes won't count to the official database. You can download your own copy of the database from https://ddnet.tw/stats though
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: You here?
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> If you click at this exact position of the search box and then paste from clipboard via ctrl+v, the game crashes
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://i.imgur.com/7F527s6.png
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> (Windows 10, nightly)
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> bad screenshot, try further right of the cursor
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> https://i.imgur.com/WcItxpb.png
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> and the search field has to be empty I guess
12:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> `rm: rec/rd1/f16753088.sr2: No space left on device` what is this oxymoron? why do I need space on the device to delete stuff?
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> lmao I thought this was gonna be like pixel perfect but I got it 1st try xd
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> linux, nightly
12:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The entire computer is dying because I don't have a single byte left on the device and it won't let me delete anything
12:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> lol what
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The people who designed macOS have got to have some sort of brain damage
12:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cipy29> xd
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you are so stupid that you can't design your software to error out properly when it runs out of space, just reserve 5%
12:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's not rocket science
13:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> yeah it's quite easy to hit the right spot ^^
13:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @murpi thanks, reproduced
13:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <murpi> serverlist shenanigans? 😄
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 try truncating the file instead of deleting it
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think I hit similar problems with linux, before
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 yep, that's what I ended up doing
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how can macos ci always be broken xD
17:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :greenthing:
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> macOS
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> macros
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> iOS
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i Jupstar
19:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Learath2#2281\: Learath2#2281Learath2#2281uwu
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> I am actually thinking about getting a new MacBook those marketing keynotes gave me vibes
19:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> And they added back physical keys so that’s a win
19:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then please fix all macos bugs for SDL and ddnet
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thanks
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Well I already have a Mac so getting a newer one won’t make me fix more bugs \:D
19:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhhh
19:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Im sure learath wanted me to do some Mac things
20:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I was going to ask something bash, then I figured it out myself
20:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> my mouse isn't grabbed by the window anymore, but I can't say that it hasn't happened before the RC
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> didnt we test it yesterday?
20:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> did you do a system update today? xd
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think it only happens non-reproducibly after some time
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I can't test because I'm in a race rn
20:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> no, didn't do a system update today
20:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mh, sad that all these window managers are soo buggy, that catapults linux even behind windows
20:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i use i3 and never had problems
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> such a bad statement
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i use kde and always have problems, but not ones with mices xD
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most times the fault is at programs for not using the proper X hints
20:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for their windows
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> put something essential as mouse grabbing should be part of a standard
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (I also use i3)
20:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i dont have problem with mouse grabbing, a good example is dota 2, while in launcher it doesnt grab and i can freely move, when in game it grabs it
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> same for tw (console vs not)
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does dota use a "normal" cursor?
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> what is a normal cursor
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I *think* so
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> (it's styled though)
21:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well like a desktop cursor basically \:D
21:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah, but they have a weird pointer for the emote wheel ^^
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> well deens hipster wm also has problems with grabbing
21:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on kde i didnt notice anything, and under windows it looked fine too
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hipster lel
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/60dce35c8ed8b373e421bd92/3x.gif
21:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i3 is hipster too
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> [2021-10-19 21:00:53][storage]: failed to remove: /home/ryozuki/.teeworlds/
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> funny message
21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah its bcs of cl\_replays 1

21:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is master3 down?
21:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> master3.ddnet.tw does not exist
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> it seems ger1:8319 is sending 64/63 in the server info
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ah nvm, it's now 64/64
21:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> hm
21:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Is chat communication encrypted for MITM?
22:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> chat is sent in clear text, no encrpytion whatsoever
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Андрей Рудой> Even private chat?
22:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> yes
22:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Yea that’s so sad .\_. When add encryption ?
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> simply adding encryption isn't hard
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but that doesn't really do anything ^^
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> you need to authenticate the server and other players somehow
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> that's not so easy
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> [chillerdragon](https://matrix.to/#/@chillerdragon:matrix.org)\: when convince oy to give away tw
22:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> when drop old ddnet client supportthese are making it unnessecary bloaty and hard
22:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> for me now
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for me yesterday
22:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't see how that makes it easier to implement encryption
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> unless you mean "drop all versions of all clients except the new version we're going to introduce"
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
22:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats what i mean
22:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I don't like that. it would e.g. mean that people from debian could no longer join the game from their distro version of DDNet
22:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it doesnt happen anyway, but ppl from debian can also use the version from website or self compile
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the map format also needs some upgrades(multiple LODs, Quads with different wrapping modes)
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that all would break old clients, so only chance is to disallow old clients
22:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> imo its just funny that decision made over 15 years ago plague us even today xD
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> custom shaders? :monkalaugh:
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> vulkan only
22:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> EZ
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imagine a desert map
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> with heat distortion shader
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cool af
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would be really cool yeah
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> maybe mods would live up again
22:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with alot more possibilities
23:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> how was ui mousesens changed in the beta
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it should now use your desktop cursor basically
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> even in editor
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so should always fell like you using paint
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its not certain if that feature will survive \:D
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> Jupstar ✪: the trick would probably be to add these changes, and not use them for a while so everyone is on a version that is new enough
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean for the packages, you could also contact the package mantainers, i assume they arent that strict for a game that nobody really cares about, are they?
23:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> there are no non-security updates in the lifetime of a debian version AFAIK
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean your thing would work sure, but you could also argue, that these ppl just have to play on servers for their version
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if you use old debian you play old teeworlds xD
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I guess with our more or less forced updates it could work today
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> probably it could.. But someone is always mad xD
23:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> @louis\: did you test it? any opinion?, i just wonder if mappers care or not, but maybe they are too used to it already. Me as nobo just thought, weird that mouse is different between menus and editor. that was my whole motivation
