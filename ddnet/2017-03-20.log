21:42 <@EastByte> you can still use /timeout ... though
21:43 < EryX> i want to replace a guy on a map in t0
21:44 <@EastByte> the tee to replace just has to use /timeout <something>

21:44 < EryX> and how do i load then
21:44 <@EastByte> by using the same cmd
21:45 < EryX> cl_timeoutcode <something>?
