00:04 <+eeeee> well, he seems to be complaining about ddnet servers
01:59 < redix> eeeee: I did not use the ddnet client but I think it would be beneficial if vanilla based clients were able to connect too
02:04 <+eeeee> yeah that'd be nice but it's not that easy unfortunately as the issue is hard to reproduce
02:04 < redix> It seems like the ddnet servers are sending around 75 (or even more?) map chunks at once. This will provoke some packet loss on most connections and will cause trouble with the resend buffer (32K). So you should either lower the map window or increase the resend buffer
02:04 <+eeeee> and i'd argue it would be even more beneficial for players if they used ddnet client instead of vanilla client :P
02:06 <+eeeee> does the map download code even use the resend buffer?
02:06 <+eeeee> wouldn't make sense since the map is the same for all clients
02:06 < redix> The new vanilla compatible code does 
02:07 <+eeeee> the "new" meaning backported from 0.7?
02:09 < redix> The new that heinrich5991 contributed some days ago 
02:10 < redix> It does a good job as long as the map window is not too big 
02:26 <+eeeee> i see. yeah if the resend buffer is 32k then sv_map_window should be capped accordingly (to 32 or so)
02:27 <+eeeee> the default value for it is 15, but not sure what ddnet servers are running
07:57 <@deen> Changed sv_map_window from 60 to 15
07:57 <@deen> should take effect next night
08:48 < Aurora> Reading through these logs is more fun than I expected.
09:03 <@heinrich5991> which logs?
09:44 < Aurora> Gl
09:44 < Aurora> The logs of chatrooms
09:44 < Aurora> This chatroom for example.
09:44 < Aurora> Well there is not a lot of activity on this one though.
09:53 < fin> nimda logs
