01:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> shouldn't it??
02:11 < bridge> <murpi> Yes
03:00 < bridge> <totar> it does for me

07:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> do i need to free quadindexes, and should i do it onshutdown or onreset?
13:51 < bridge> <filoqcus> How to use `bans_save`? After the ban the nicknames are not added. Or do I need to put nicknames in there so that they will be banned?
13:51 < bridge> <filoqcus> @blaiszephyr :>>
13:53 < furo> `bans_save` takes a file as an argument and will then write all current bans to that file. So, `bans_save bans.txt`
13:55 < bridge> <filoqcus> I did, I ban myself through econ, but my nickname is not on the list.
13:55 < bridge> <filoqcus> I did, I ban myself through econ, but my nickname is not on the list
13:56 < bridge> <filoqcus> "current", Okay, I get it. Sorry :>
13:56 < bridge> <filoqcus> :nouis:
13:56 < furo> I think you misunderstood me. It won't automatically add to that file, it will write all current ones.
13:57 < bridge> <filoqcus> Can I make a list that bans IPs every time the server is restarted?
13:57 < furo> You can add `exec bans.txt` to your autoexec if that's what you mean.
13:59 < bridge> <filoqcus> I want to test it

17:15 < bridge> <Ewan> lmfao
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> Someone explain to me how in the fuck this is happening
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> 
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> ```html
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> <script lang="ts">
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> let foo = "hsl(180 50 50)"
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> </script>
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> 
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> <div style="color: {foo}">test</div>
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> ```
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> somehow turns into
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> 
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> `<div class="s-OmDL1Jbl-mn5" style="color: rgb(64, 191, 191);">test</div>`
17:32 < bridge> <learath2> How, what, why? I don't even know what to google
17:33 < bridge> <Assa> looks like some internal conversion from hsl to rgb?
17:33 < bridge> <milkeeycat> is this some modern webdev magic? üò¨
17:33 < bridge> <learath2> where on earth would this even be documented? how do I stop it even?
17:34 < bridge> <learath2> Svelte just decides to convert my hsl colors to rgb colors just to annoy me?
17:34 < bridge> <Assa> sounds like an average java script experience to me
17:34 < bridge> <learath2> I actually am baffled, who did they think would be helped by this feature?
17:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> looks like they just convert hsl to rgb on runtime
17:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
17:35 < bridge> <learath2> I don't even know who to blame, where is this happening, is it firefox doing this?
17:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> what happens when you define HSL with % ?
17:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
17:35 < bridge> <melo∆û> hsl(180 50% 50%)
17:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> does it convert that?
17:36 < bridge> <learath2> Yep
17:36 < bridge> <melo∆û> maybe you can shit on it with css magic so it doesnt do that
17:36 < bridge> <milkeeycat> not firefox
17:36 < bridge> <learath2> Is it vite, is it svelte? Who is ruining my day?
17:37 < bridge> <learath2> I want to say some bad things about someone
17:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im writing php btw üòè
17:38 < bridge> <milkeeycat> im writing in php btw üòè
17:39 < bridge> <Sans> oooo
17:39 < bridge> <Sans> svelte
17:39 < bridge> <Sans> @learath2 ur culprit is svelte most likely
17:40 < bridge> <learath2> I have actually never been more annoyed with something
17:40 < bridge> <learath2> if within 10 minutes I don't find whatever is doing this I'm going back to just writing jquery
17:40 < bridge> <Sans> why use hsl though, browsers internally work with rgb im pretty sure
17:41 < bridge> <learath2> because the stupid converter is also trying to convert my hsl colors derived from packed teeworlds colors, which wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't failing so bad that the variable ends up undefined and I get no style at all
17:42 < bridge> <Sans> btw try doing it with a css variable like
17:42 < bridge> <Sans> 
17:42 < bridge> <Sans> ```html
17:42 < bridge> <Sans> <script lang="ts">
17:42 < bridge> <Sans> let foo = "hsl(180, 50, 50)"
17:42 < bridge> <Sans> </script>
17:42 < bridge> <Sans> 
17:42 < bridge> <Sans> <div style="--text-color: {foo}; color: var(--text-color)">test</div>
17:42 < bridge> <Sans> ```
17:42 < bridge> <Sans> use whatever var name u want
17:42 < bridge> <Sans> it should prevent svelte from auto converting it
17:43 < bridge> <Sans> keyword \*should*, i have basically no real experience with svelte
17:44 < bridge> <learath2> I figured it out, I was using the legacy hsl format, which the converter just can't handle, so instead of just bailing and leaving it alone, it outputs `undefined` without logging any error
17:44 < bridge> <Sans> css variables and javascript are like stale bread and old butter
17:44 < bridge> <Sans> :heh:
17:44 < bridge> <learath2> I swear all modern developers need jail
17:44 < bridge> <learath2> Just no questions, jail
17:44 < bridge> <Sans> mm yes i agree
17:44 < bridge> <Sans> you tell em
17:45 < bridge> <Sans> tell em to also implement types to vanilla js too while you're at it plese :owo:
17:45 < bridge> <Sans> tell em to also implement types to vanilla js too while you're at it please :owo:
17:45 < bridge> <learath2> typescript people are solid, I'll allow them to go on
17:45 < bridge> <learath2> If you created a js framework, jail
17:45 < bridge> <Sans> no no, typescript people are typescript people
17:45 < bridge> <Sans> solid is another customer
17:45 < bridge> <Sans> https://www.solidjs.com/
17:46 < bridge> <learath2> Like who thought it was a good idea to just output `undefined` without logging anything when an undocumented obscure optimization fails?
17:46 < bridge> <chairn> why risc-v is cocaine ?
17:46 < bridge> <Sans> I might've done that before üòÖ
17:47 < bridge> <Sans> in my defense, i was the only one working on the project
17:47 < bridge> <Sans> and/or using it
17:48 < bridge> <Sans> @learath2 a big thing in js is that anything can be undefined if not documented, remembering this and checking for it will save you a few headaches
17:48 < bridge> <Sans> i learned the hard way :heh:
17:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> i am sure that svelte has nothing to do with that
17:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> probably some css library that svelte uses does it
17:48 < bridge> <kollpotato> postcss or whatever
17:48 < bridge> <learath2> Tell me who does it so I can complain on their issue tracker
17:49 < bridge> <learath2> Can't even google for it because google thinks I'm trying to convert hsl to rgb
17:49 < bridge> <Sans> have you tried geepeetee
17:49 < bridge> <Sans> works 100% of the time, 20% of the time
17:50 < bridge> <learath2> I was hoping I could just avoid rgb but I guess I need it for the transformation matrix anyway
17:50 < bridge> <Sans> what are you cooking though?
17:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> @learath2 this might be relevant https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39208559/browsers-automatically-evaluate-hex-or-hsl-colors-to-rgb-when-setting-via-elemen
18:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> and the only thing that svelte does is apply the css style internally through the `style` property
18:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> so the issue is software
18:15 < bridge> <learath2> Not too far off I guess

18:23 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> temporary permanent fixes for the win
18:24 < bridge> <syrinok> 0.7 has better custom colors (I guess they never touched how the custom colors work? And they're a PVP focused client) so what's the issue here
18:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just add 0.7 skins to ddnet srvs :D
18:24 < bridge> <syrinok> I wouldn't go that far
18:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats not very far [sad_cat](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/873457028981481473.webp?size=48&name=sad_cat)
18:26 < bridge> <syrinok> I like the idea of customizing skins, but I don't like the idea of breaking every skin that already exists, a mix would be cool
18:26 < bridge> <syrinok> Straying from the topic though, fix custom colors : madge :
18:27 < bridge> <Property of Souly> yeah idk why it kills the contrast in skins when custom colors is enabled
18:27 < bridge> <learath2> What happened with them?
18:27 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> allowing 0.7 skins doesnt break ddnet/0.6 skins

18:28 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Certain skins? Like really dark ones I'd guess?

18:29 < bridge> <learath2> I doubt we touched this at all anytime soon, when was this skin fine?
18:29 < bridge> <oxyzo.> broken
18:29 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so the first step is to nicely scale the brightness so the brightest part of the image, no matter how dark, matches the target colour
18:29 < bridge> <Property of Souly> remember how fucked it made the AoE skin
18:29 < bridge> <syrinok> Ages ago
18:30 < bridge> <syrinok> Like 6 years ago now probably? 7?
18:30 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> its not jank from vanilla?
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> I don't think it ever was correct, this looks like it's the 0.6 greyscaling messing with it
18:30 < bridge> <syrinok> It was fine at one point
18:30 < bridge> <learath2> I'd be very surprised, but if you do know a version that it definitely worked at I'd be happy to take a look
18:31 < bridge> <syrinok> Then just stopped being fine when people were mad about certain black skins being black in team modes
18:31 < bridge> <learath2> I doubt we touched this at all anytime recently, when was this skin fine?
18:32 < bridge> <Sans> Are you using my package?
18:32 < bridge> <Sans> istg if i have to fix that thing once again i will commit die
18:32 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> don't we have like a flag for pvp modes? So we could just force brighten dark skins in team modes specifically?
18:32 < bridge> <syrinok> would be a hella better approach
18:32 < bridge> <learath2> Nah, I'm rendering them myself, I couldn't make yours work, was about to put a hole through my screen, so I decided to have some nice melissa tea and code my own
18:33 < bridge> <Sans> wdym couldnt make it work XD
18:33 < bridge> <syrinok> Also I'm 100% confident this was an issue that was added to combat the problem quickly, and it was definitely fine for years of 0.6
18:33 < bridge> <syrinok> Lemme try to find when it happened, well, souly probably knows
18:33 < bridge> <Property of Souly> wheres the code segment that deals with how the tees look under custom colors?
18:33 < bridge> <syrinok> @soulyvevo HELP
18:33 < bridge> <Sans> its for the backend ig you tried to run it in the frontend?
18:34 < bridge> <learath2> Yeah I figured that out much later, I needed to render them at the frontend
18:34 < bridge> <Sans> ehhh
18:34 < bridge> <learath2> I'm not hosting a node instance just to render a couple tees lol
18:34 < bridge> <Sans> fair

18:35 < bridge> <Sans> did you know the eyes drift apart from each other
18:35 < bridge> <Sans> in game
18:35 < bridge> <Sans> :heh: good luck
18:35 < bridge> <learath2> Yes, I implemented that a week ago in godot
18:36 < bridge> <Sans> if you done it with the tee rendering doc by patiga then you did it wrong
18:36 < bridge> <learath2> We also fixed the tee rendering doc along the way
18:36 < bridge> <Sans> o
18:36 < bridge> <Sans> no
18:36 < bridge> <learath2> Well technically Patiga fixed it while I messed around with the numbers until I figured out what's wrong

18:48 < bridge> <Sans> looks fine to me
18:48 < bridge> <syrinok> Custom colors is the issue
18:48 < bridge> <Sans> mm right
18:49 < bridge> <Sans> gimme the color codes
18:49 < bridge> <Sans> or component values

18:52 < bridge> <syrinok> From what I've seen from souly / SP showing me 0.7 colors, it should look like less of an eyesore
18:52 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355600465873867007/image.png?ex=67e984d0&is=67e83350&hm=aa87c3701b5e6014e0a74a125588e45c45d06e550e17745e8d078b5355614884&
18:52 < bridge> <syrinok> looks the same, is that 0.7?
18:52 < bridge> <Sans> nop
18:52 < bridge> <Sans> its my 0.6 renderer
18:52 < bridge> <syrinok> Oh, just comparing colors
18:52 < bridge> <syrinok> I see
18:53 < bridge> <Sans> x256

18:53 < bridge> <Sans> the blurrrr
18:53 < bridge> <syrinok> I wanna see 0.7 colors now
18:53 < bridge> <Sans> this thing wasnt made with such high res tees in mind
18:53 < bridge> <syrinok> Any smart, get to it!
18:53 < bridge> <syrinok> Any1 smart, get to it!
18:53 < bridge> <Sans> wdym 0.7 colors
18:53 < bridge> <syrinok> They handle custom colors differently
18:53 < bridge> <Sans> do they now
18:53 < bridge> <syrinok> ya afaik
18:54 < bridge> <Sans> they dont lol
18:54 < bridge> <vappy19> Daaamn cleaan
18:54 < bridge> <Sans> at least they apply the colors the same way im pretty sur
18:54 < bridge> <Sans> at least they apply the colors the same way im pretty sure
18:54 < bridge> <syrinok> It's different somehow! what happened in 0.6 / ddnet to ruin everything
18:54 < bridge> <learath2> The only difference is that they greyscale the initial image differently
18:54 < bridge> <learath2> @syrinok is this skin on the skindb?
18:54 < bridge> <Sans> ^^^^
18:54 < bridge> <syrinok> Which one?
18:55 < bridge> <learath2> Whichever one looks like shit
18:55 < bridge> <syrinok> The Broke one, nah, my skin is ya
18:55 < bridge> <learath2> this one I guess
18:55 < bridge> <learath2> What is the name of your skin?
18:55 < bridge> <syrinok> My skin looks like shit with custom colors imo
18:55 < bridge> <syrinok> Syrinok
18:55 < bridge> <syrinok> He's asking so he can remove it, ggs bros
18:56 < bridge> <syrinok> Problem solved :santatrollet:
18:56 < bridge> <Sans> gg
18:56 < bridge> <syrinok> Pretty much every skin that has dark colors looks terrible, it's why most serious skin creators avoid it
18:56 < bridge> <syrinok> Cause custom colors destroy them
18:57 < bridge> <learath2> I was curious what it'd look like on my new renderer, and it looks completely wrong üòÑ
18:57 < bridge> <learath2> üòÑ
18:57 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355601737150501096/image.png?ex=67e985ff&is=67e8347f&hm=6fc1e8078d42599babb81372fe611984f4b2dde7da54faf424728e251fe0edaa&
18:57 < bridge> <syrinok> That looks more akin to 0.7!
18:57 < bridge> <syrinok> but much darker
18:58 < bridge> <Sans> @learath2 if it helps any, check out how I did my [grayscaling](<https://github.com/Sans3108/DDNet/blob/2527315ada66375b46b800f39defcf6f1759f058/src/classes/skins/TeeSkinUtils.ts#L116>) and [tinting](<https://github.com/Sans3108/DDNet/blob/2527315ada66375b46b800f39defcf6f1759f058/src/classes/skins/TeeSkinUtils.ts#L156>)
18:59 < bridge> <Sans> I'm like 99.99% sure that any skin rendered by the lib looks exactly how i'd look in game
18:59 < bridge> <Sans> i at least hope so, i spent too much time
18:59 < bridge> <Sans> i at least hope so, i spent too much time on it
18:59 < bridge> <syrinok> Something like this is 100% how dark skins should be handled with custom colors, not just randomly brightened imo
19:01 < bridge> <syrinok> @soulyvevo I saw you type earlier, how dare you flake during such a pivotal moment in your job. YOU FOOL
19:01 < bridge> <Sans> I'm like 99.99% sure that any skin rendered by the lib looks exactly how it'd look in game
19:05 < bridge> <syrinok> I had to look at my message history with SP Someone (ew)

19:05 < bridge> <learath2> Here is what it looks like with your colors
19:05 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355603780690772058/image.png?ex=67e987e7&is=67e83667&hm=0f2d42a0a845b1c3f580c9540b6b4a41168b87dbe0b7470d6057e26b9c5795f7&
19:05 < bridge> <syrinok> This is the difference
19:05 < bridge> <learath2> Actually let me see what it looks like in 0.7, I'm curious too now
19:06 < bridge> <learath2> (i'd guess handling it like this allows completely black tees, which we probably didnt'
19:06 < bridge> <learath2> (i'd guess handling it like this allows completely black tees, which we probably didn't want at some point)
19:06 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> i think some parts are allowed to be completely black in 0.7
19:06 < bridge> <syrinok> Yep, but it ruins the custom colors unfortunately
19:07 < bridge> <syrinok> I would love a different solution
19:09 < bridge> <syrinok> As risu said, could just do it for PVP modes, rather than all
19:12 < bridge> <learath2> This is what it looks like with 0.7 greyscaling
19:12 < bridge> <learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355605480764084535/skeithee.png?ex=67e9897c&is=67e837fc&hm=ce51002d65423753ee576dcd626ce5d1c792257373362adec10192270db42acd&
19:12 < bridge> <syrinok> Guys, why am I here fighting for things to change in a game I swore to take a break from
19:12 < bridge> <syrinok> Am I down bad
19:12 < bridge> <learath2> So pretty close to what my css attempt looks like actually üòÑ
19:12 < bridge> <syrinok> huge improvement over wtf this is tbh
19:14 < bridge> <syrinok> Couldn't we slap the pure black skins with a hint of grey then color them based on that instead, if detected
19:14 < bridge> <louis> what are u fighting for
19:14 < bridge> <syrinok> MY RIGHTS
19:14 < bridge> <syrinok> (Better custom colors)
19:14 < bridge> <learath2> @robyt3 do you happen to know why we don't just get rid of the weird frequency analysis thing?
19:14 < bridge> <syrinok> Also bring back my right click Lear, I'm not playing around
19:14 < bridge> <louis> theyre already pretty decent
19:15 < bridge> <louis> ur fault for using a black skin
19:15 < bridge> <louis> :justatest:
19:15 < bridge> <learath2> What we could do if blacktees were the issue is to clamp the lighting of the grayscaled skin, just map it so the lighting is never below 0.2 or something like that
19:15 < bridge> <syrinok> racist as fuck tbh, I allow you 5 seconds to take it back
19:15 < bridge> <robyt3> We'd maybe have to do some test with existing skins to see how large the difference is
19:15 < bridge> <syrinok> He didn't take it back
19:15 < bridge> <learath2> We could do field testing, change it, don't put it in the changelog, see who complains üòÑ
19:16 < bridge> <syrinok> It allows for lighter skins to be lighter too, afaik
19:16 < bridge> <syrinok> From what I was seeing on 0.7, at least
19:16 < bridge> <syrinok> We currently allow for awkwardly grey white, as the whitest tee for most of the vanilla skins
19:17 < bridge> <robyt3> 0.7 also changed the darkest allowed lightness value
19:17 < bridge> <syrinok> Lets steal from 0.7
19:18 < bridge> <robyt3> ```cpp
19:18 < bridge> <robyt3> constexpr static const float DARKEST_LGT = 0.5f;
19:18 < bridge> <robyt3> constexpr static const float DARKEST_LGT7 = 61.0f / 255.0f;
19:18 < bridge> <robyt3> ```
19:18 < bridge> <louis> let users write their own shaders to apply to their tee
19:19 < bridge> <Sans> that is upscaled from this
19:19 < bridge> <Sans> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355607290316849213/Syrinok.png?ex=67e98b2b&is=67e839ab&hm=ff0b8cf7741cb09a8cb57cefd66ed0295b00abee61d9b455e6f3d8e83bec5765&
19:19 < bridge> <syrinok> Too many options, lets bin this whole thing.
19:19 < bridge> <syrinok> Good talk ü§ù 
19:19 < bridge> <syrinok> Move along everybody
19:19 < bridge> <Sans> im getting the skin files from skrumplex proxy
19:20 < bridge> <syrinok> Ya :greenthing: custom colors are cookied for 0.6, life cruel
19:21 < bridge> <learath2> I always thought 0.7 allowed darker lgt than 0.6
19:21 < bridge> <learath2> I guess time does make you forget
19:22 < bridge> <learath2> I really need to add a bar to my screen, not seeing the clock I keep forgetting to eat until I get a hunger headache
19:23 < bridge> <syrinok> You just enjoyed talking to me too much
19:23 < bridge> <learath2> This is true
19:33 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> heinrich mood

19:42 < bridge> <learath2> I understand why https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/master/doc/tee_rendering.md feels so weird
19:42 < bridge> <learath2> It reads like movements but without an origin given

20:08 < furo> You can use `CClient::SaveReplay`, I guess.
20:10 < bridge> <Cammodude> i tried but idk enough c++ to figure out this

20:10 < furo> How did you call it?
20:11 < bridge> <Cammodude> just CClient::SaveReplay() with #include <engine/client/client.h> at the top of the file
20:12 < bridge> <learath2> You need to get a reference to the client instance first
20:12 < bridge> <Cammodude> i have no idea what that means
20:14 < bridge> <zhn> from which file you try to call it
20:14 < bridge> <Assa> this error is from using a base class (or interface) instead of directly using a derived class
20:14 < bridge> <Assa> ~~bs~+
20:14 < bridge> <Assa> ~~bs~~
20:14 < bridge> <Cammodude> custom one from game/client/components

20:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
20:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> or smth
20:15 < bridge> <Assa> `Client()->SaveReplay()`
20:17 < bridge> <Cammodude> maybe works ?
20:17 < bridge> <zhn> if you are calling it from component then you can us `GameClient()->...`

20:21 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs object oriented programming my dhde
20:21 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs object oriented programming my dude
20:37 < bridge> <patiga> Would a line "Choose any point in space" help? ^^
20:39 < bridge> <patiga> I also quite desperately avoided writing stuff in units, because then I'd need to specify a coordinate system (would've been better maybe)
20:39 < bridge> <patiga> Instead, I just wrote up/down/left/write everywhere
20:44 < bridge> <learath2> Here is how I'm planning to document it when I figure it out completely.
20:44 < bridge> <learath2> 
20:44 < bridge> <learath2> Top left corner of the body sprite is (0,0) bottom right corner is (1, -1)
20:45 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that makes sense but... kinda cursed
20:46 < bridge> <patiga> @ocosar account is comprimised, sending fake steam links
20:46 < bridge> <learath2> I thought about doing it bottom left corner is (0,0) and top right corner is (1,1)
20:46 < bridge> <learath2> but then I think a lot of the values will change dramatically from the values in the code, so it might not be easy to see how it relates
20:49 < bridge> <patiga> I think its just a matter of time until Pulsar's acc spams steam links in here
20:50 < bridge> <learath2> Actually I do not remember how we render quads in teeworlds. Do we position them from the TL corner?
20:50 < bridge> <patiga> what is the lower left corner though?
20:50 < bridge> <learath2> (0, -1)
20:50 < bridge> <patiga> I think the center of a tee is quite well defined
20:51 < bridge> <learath2> Oh, do we render quads positioned from their centers?
20:51 < bridge> <patiga> yes
20:51 < bridge> <learath2> Okay, then (0,0) at the center might make more sense
20:51 < bridge> <patiga> at least the calls in the tee rendering code suggest that, would be weird if the backends do that differently later
20:52 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> What's the origin of the tee physics-wise? I forget, is it at the feet or at the middle?
20:53 < bridge> <learath2> I guess I'd keep the side of the tee as 1, so 0.5 at the corners, which is a little ugly, but what can you do
20:53 < bridge> <learath2> middle iirc
20:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok then I'd definitely agree with (0, 0) at the middle
20:54 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> APPROXIMATE A TEE AS A UNIT CIRCLE
20:55 < bridge> <learath2> Problem with (0, 0) in the middle is that it just isn't that nice to give measurements from the center
20:55 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> assume a spherical ~~cow~~ tee
20:56 < bridge> <learath2> Because usually in schematics you give distances to edges, it just is prettier to graph (and perhaps for actually building stuff much easier as a reference point)
20:57 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> do we prefer a document that's prettier or one that's easier to just write out in code?
20:57 < bridge> <learath2> @blaiszephyr you machine stuff, confirm people usually give measurements from edges when machining stuff
20:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> from edges as in?
20:57 < bridge> <learath2> I think document that is easier to get to code is better
20:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> what are we talking about here
20:58 < bridge> <learath2> Would you ever be given distance to the center of something + an angle when making a cut e.g.?
20:58 < bridge> <patiga> the "side" of a tee is really ill-defined afaik, as long as you don't mean the size of the body quad
20:58 < bridge> <patiga> and the body quad is quite large
20:58 < bridge> <learath2> I mean the side of the body quad
20:59 < bridge> <learath2> This is for rendering, I think the "physics size" of a tee should have absolutely nothing to do with it
20:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh no
20:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I just had a tragic realisation
20:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> tees aren't actually round
20:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> it's an illusion
20:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> they're squares with transparent corners
20:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> 
20:59 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> like I know this is obvious but it hurts to think about
20:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> ofc
21:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> tho its mostly just done so math is easier
21:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> not because its practical for everything
21:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> well you do need to know how big to render a tee in relation to its physics size
21:00 < bridge> <learath2> Say you are drilling a hole in a rectangle, would the schematic ever be positioning the hole relative to the center instead of one of the corners, e.g.
21:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> or more like you need to know how big to render a tee in relation to how big tiles are
21:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> theoretically never, no
21:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> practically all the time xD
21:01 < bridge> <learath2> Because that is kinda what we are dealing with here, the body is a square and we are finding points on the square to put other stuff at
21:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> see it that way
21:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> if you know your rectangle is a perfect 25.0000 | 25.0000 - you can easily take the center as the point zero (0|0)
21:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> so yes, you can do that in our case
21:02 < bridge> <learath2> That iirc has nothing to do with the "physics" size of a tee either since the "physics" size of a tee changes with what it's interacting with üòÑ
21:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> just got here, any tldr
21:03 < bridge> <learath2> If we are being reaaaally accurate what you want to know is the render scale of a tile relative to the render scale of a tee
21:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> doing all that from one of the corners may make it easier or harder, depending on the actual schematic you're trying to achieve
21:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @essigautomat can we get different colors for doors and the other one
21:03 < bridge> <patiga> the body quad of the tee = 2 ingame tiles iirc
21:03 < bridge> <learath2> (or viceversa)
21:03 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> grabby
21:03 < bridge> <tymur_trofymenk> hi dev
21:03 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> oh yeah I remember reading something in the vein of `.getPhysicalSize() * 1.2`, lotsa fun magic constants there
21:03 < bridge> <tymur_trofymenk> risu good avatar xd
21:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> grabby (or i can do that myself /shrug)
21:05 < bridge> <Assa> what do you mean, door colors by door id?
21:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> for rendering a tee, it should be easier to from from the center point and offset the eyes X0|Y25 instead of doing that from the left downwards corner going X15|Y35 for example
21:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> i hope i got your actual question right and was of use
21:05 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> have a color difference between doors and grabbers
21:06 < bridge> <cyberfrighter> @hectavoxel did you have any ideas
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> to me a door is more similar to the spinny one
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> than a grabber is
21:06 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355634260605669456/image.png?ex=67e9a44a&is=67e852ca&hm=d9edc331c664a6fba32b76732ac3b761914b3321afc87f6334fde319e3661717&
21:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that freezes you right?
21:07 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> nvm xd
21:09 < bridge> <Assa> @sollybunny yes, I'd usually agree, i am also working on this one: https://github.com/AssassinTee/ddnet/pull/13
21:09 < bridge> <Assa> I am a bit unsure about that feature. Idea was to make the on/off have the same color as the door, but we don't have an on/off switch, we have an off- and an on-tile without containing entities
21:10 < bridge> <Assa> so I see you've found the visual difference? xD
21:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i still would like seperate colors for them irregardless of \#13
21:15 < bridge> <Assa> I could do that, this is just CItems->RenderLaser, CMenuSettings->LaserPreview and 2 new config variables
21:16 < bridge> <patiga> @blaiszephyr and do you have one universal coordinate system? or do people use y and -y interchangeably?  ^^
21:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> XYZ and ABC + and -
21:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ^???
21:17 < bridge> <patiga> in 2d, would +y be up or down?
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> its basically:
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> X=right
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> -X=left
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> Y=forward
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> Y=backwards
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> Z=up
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> -Z=down
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> A= rotate X
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> B= rotate Y
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> C= rotate Z
21:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> y would be up, x right
21:17 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> not a mc chad i see then
21:18 < bridge> <patiga> in ddnet, y goes down üòÖ
21:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> in 2d the origin is top left
21:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no one argues about that apart from opengl
21:18 < bridge> <patiga> well that goes for uv coordinates I suppose?
21:18 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> in opengl the bottom left is the origin
21:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and even in scratch where the origin is at the center its still +x -> right +y -> down
21:19 < bridge> <patiga> in the viewport / in window coordinates, there is no top-left I'd say
21:19 < bridge> <Assa> @sollybunny then find out for me how to render a frozen tee for the laser preview, let's overengineer this
21:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i guess its very not ovious that a laser freezes you
21:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> similar to how i often miss hearts
21:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and i get frozen and am annoyed
21:19 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe we can add particles to it
21:20 < bridge> <Assa> hearts are actually annoying, I always want to pick them up to heal
21:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> dis how it works in machining
21:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355637660873392258/image.png?ex=67e9a774&is=67e855f4&hm=caf22af9e2b8bd727ab517974d1a9c7b7a236decc566a92afcce37b0bba8b71d&
21:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> in a 3D space
21:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> in 3d space thats most common
21:20 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> but theres alot more disagreement
21:20 < bridge> <Assa> y = down
21:20 < bridge> <Assa> x = right
21:20 < bridge> <Assa> z = in your monitor
21:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> you disgust me
21:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> xD
21:20 < bridge> <Assa> in ddnet*
21:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ddnet never uses the 3rd dimension does it?
21:21 < bridge> <melo∆û> but.. why?
21:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> depth buffer is disabled
21:21 < bridge> <Assa> because .. legacy
21:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think sheilds should be chanegd to a weapon with a minus on it or something
21:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and hearts to something which looks.. more freezy
21:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> maybe like a snowflake
21:21 < bridge> <jxsl13> I smell Multimap, the best of them all.
21:21 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and their hitbox to be more obvious
21:22 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> (that is make them 2x bigger)
21:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> you disgust me even more
21:22 < bridge> <melo∆û> its obviously Aequilibrium
21:22 < bridge> <Assa> with my current preview, the laser has a classical laser head and flickers, everything which can't freeze you has another laser head
21:22 < bridge> <Cammodude> compiles but crashes when i run that bit
21:22 < bridge> <patiga> it kinda makes sense because this way the coordinate system alignes with the map tilemaps
21:22 < bridge> <Assa> with my current preview, the laser has a classical laser head and flickers, everything which can't freeze you has another laser head and doesn't flicker
21:22 < bridge> <jxsl13> my apolocheese
21:23 < bridge> <jxsl13> multimap is the only map I know
21:23 < bridge> <jxsl13> so everything looks like it
21:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> i mean it only aligns because it was designed that way 25 years ago? XD
21:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> so its all matricks fault in the end
21:23 < bridge> <patiga> I think that is the usual ndarray layout
21:23 < bridge> <Assa> also @sollybunny show me how to render a frozen Tee in teeworlds
21:23 < bridge> <Assa> also @sollybunny show me how to render a frozen Tee
21:23 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> am I evil for kinda liking left-handed coordinates?
21:23 < bridge> <melo∆û> you strip it off its colors and make its eyes weirdly shaped
21:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> look at nameplate preview its quite simple
21:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the skin name is just x_frozen
21:24 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the skin name is just x_frozen / x_ninja i forgot
21:24 < bridge> <jxsl13> gang signs and stuff.

21:36 < bridge> <Assa> Time to cntl c cntl v the rest of the menu
21:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> you can space them out more
21:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> then have a frozen tee on the frozen one
21:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> is this without the rubberband effect
21:36 < bridge> <Assa> I already asked you twice how to render a FROZEN tee
21:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and custom ends
21:36 < bridge> <robyt3> Also `TEE_EFFECT_FROZEN`
21:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> .
21:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and that
21:38 < bridge> <robyt3> Check `CPlayers::OnRender`. To be fully correct you'd also have to handle `cl_show_ninja` correctly
21:38 < bridge> <Assa> is the skin m_OriginSkin or something like that?
21:39 < bridge> <Property of Souly> what color are you going to make it
21:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think there should be a method to render a frozen tee, because there are alot of settings (and tclient adds more)
21:40 < bridge> <robyt3> ok, looks like that doesn't work if you use `CRenderTools` functions to render the too
21:40 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> :D
21:40 < bridge> <Assa> was already going to ask :justatest:
21:41 < bridge> <robyt3> All tee rendering should probably be moved to one file `render_tee.cpp`. Some is currently in `render.cpp` but some only on `players.cpp` so you can't easily render a frozen tee it seems
21:41 < bridge> <learath2> You need to get a valid copy of `CClient *`, how you can get one depends on where in the code we are currently
21:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr pog

21:42 < bridge> <Cammodude> well ill try to search trough the code and hope i understand
21:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> melon playing ddnet?!
21:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> me playing is more rare
21:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
21:44 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> üçà
21:44 < bridge> <ryozuki> @blaiszephyr good job doing ur mod duty once in a year
21:45 < bridge> <learath2> it might not be so easy if you are inside the game client under `src/game/`, we don't expose `SaveReplay` to the game client. So you'd need to wire that up too
21:45 < bridge> <melo∆û> poggers!
21:45 < bridge> <Cammodude> so what youre saying is that im screwed
21:46 < bridge> <melo∆û> ay blya
21:46 < bridge> <learath2> You can try to just go through the console, `ExecuteLine("save_replay")` might work üòÑ
21:47 < bridge> <Cammodude> i couldve run a console command this whole time ?
21:47 < bridge> <learath2> Yep
21:47 < bridge> <Cammodude> bruh moment
21:47 < bridge> <learath2> but you need an instance of `IConsole` for it, so you have the same issue
21:47 < bridge> <learath2> but executeline is available unlike SAvereplay
21:56 < bridge> <Assa> @sollybunny

21:56 < bridge> <Assa> only thing missing is the freeze effect now
21:57 < bridge> <robyt3> Just add `GameClient()->m_Effects.FreezingFlakes(BodyPos, vec2(32, 32), Alpha);` manually I guess
21:58 < bridge> <robyt3> Effects might not be updated when offline though, there is some weird per tick caching of `time_get` in some components
22:00 < bridge> <robyt3> How about also rendering a tee trying to cross the closed door?
22:00 < bridge> <Assa> yeah this one is not working
22:00 < bridge> <kebscs> so no colored lasers from editor?
22:00 < bridge> <kebscs> colored laser better than setting own custom color
22:00 < bridge> <kebscs> which noone does anyway
22:00 < bridge> <Property of Souly> spacing between the two ones with tees feel a bit close
22:00 < bridge> <Property of Souly> if its consistent with the other ones, maybe try to space all them out a bit just so theres a bit more space for the tees
22:01 < bridge> <Property of Souly> i dunno
22:01 < bridge> <Assa> I already set the value up
22:01 < bridge> <Property of Souly> ohh
22:01 < bridge> <Assa> but just a tiny bit
22:01 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355648112625975457/screenshot_2025-03-29_22-01-28.png?ex=67e9b130&is=67e85fb0&hm=26cce677793f8d78b645555c77fc178c05a90328e40847197ac069d63e304f77&
22:01 < bridge> <Property of Souly> yea thats better
22:02 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> this will definatley look better with the new end bits
22:02 < bridge> <Assa> yes certainly
22:04 < bridge> <Assa> I am currently not decided on it, as I wrote above, the use is missing
22:04 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> minor refactoring

22:07 < bridge> <Property of Souly> basically a free variable :nouis:
22:08 < bridge> <Assa> @hectavoxel can you come up with a new grabber color?
22:08 < bridge> <kebscs> 3 nameplate reworks for them still look the same :nouis:
22:08 < bridge> <kebscs> 3 nameplate reworks for them to still look the same :nouis:
22:09 < bridge> <Assa> hmm, we currently have blue, brown, puple and green, I guess we have a lot of colors we could use xD
22:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 1 of them isnt a rework
22:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 1 of them was to make it more generalized
22:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 1 made it modular
22:09 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> the diff between tater and ddnet is tiny (once i get this merged)
22:10 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> tater just copied my masters nameplates.cpp which had changes not upstreamed yet so rn its a mess
22:10 < bridge> <chillerdragon> \#7777 mentioned

22:11 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yep
22:11 < bridge> <kebscs> at least is this fixed? <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9936>
22:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> that was never an issue
22:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i thtink they were on an old version plagued by a an actuall issue (similar to as described) which was fixed
22:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> see the comment i left
22:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> where i overexplained
22:12 < bridge> <Property of Souly> im mobile
22:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> #ff0000
22:12 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> because it grabs your soul
22:13 < bridge> <Property of Souly> maybe orange?
22:13 < bridge> <Assa> I agree xDD
22:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> we dont have enough warm colors
22:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> anything reddy i like
22:13 < bridge> <Assa> also looks with the new orbs like the menace that it is
22:13 < bridge> <Property of Souly> not directly red tho
22:13 < bridge> <Property of Souly> if its red then it might signify its bad
22:13 < bridge> <Property of Souly> so like, a nice orange
22:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats true
22:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> go with orenge
22:13 < bridge> <Assa> yeah i mixed a tiny bit of white in
22:13 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> pink!?>
22:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> whoo
22:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i mean you can change it thats the point but xd
22:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i think there should be other visual indication 
22:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 1. for color blind people
22:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 2. for idiots who think black is a good color scheme
22:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 3. for being able to parse other people setups
22:14 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> 4. for you yourself identifying them
22:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> this fix was required for me to build using an older version of clang 14.0.6

22:15 < bridge> <melo∆û> is this worth a pr? will this break stuff?

22:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> which there will be <3
22:15 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> no, pr it
22:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats good to know, yes, no, pr it
22:16 < bridge> <robyt3> There's already an issue for it, should be fixed. But the fix isn't optimal, just remove `str_format` and let `dbg_assert` do the format
22:16 < bridge> <melo∆û> i see - i'll do that then ^^

22:16 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> o yeah big brain

22:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh wait u can control the outline now?

22:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i feel like theres little reason to just -0.2 lightness or something but cool
22:31 < bridge> <Assa> Enter <always has been> meme here
22:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i see
22:31 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> good to know
22:33 < bridge> <Assa> Now, I could do the PR, but unfortunately I am missing reviews @sollybunny üòõ
22:33 < bridge> <Assa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355656235021631558/screenshot_2025-03-29_22-33-07.png?ex=67e9b8c1&is=67e86741&hm=a004125740db010bf8782a297854e109519dc578d2c1a14a2bc46a6339b1735e&

22:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i mean i feel like all the features you have are non controversial
22:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> just make em one or something /shrug
22:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> xd
22:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> btw why arent the doors got a thing on either side
22:34 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats always been a thing thats bugged me
22:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @essigautomat
22:35 < bridge> <Assa> ah you mean ingame
22:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355656623389147246/image.png?ex=67e9b91d&is=67e8679d&hm=401ba4ef2153002606e0f250714d7d0b728639b2413a6f1103eadf344c4ee166&
22:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yeah
22:35 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> its just cutoff
22:35 < bridge> <Assa> because, they don't have a fixed length which exactly tiles
22:35 < bridge> <Assa> you'll now say: that's bullshit
22:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i do
22:36 < bridge> <Assa> but then you forgot diagonals
22:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i dont understand
22:36 < bridge> <Assa> the end position of a door is not always in the middle of a tile
22:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> thats fine
22:36 < bridge> <Assa> I mean otherwise, open an issue xD
22:36 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> does the icon have to be middle of the tile
22:37 < bridge> <Assa> not really, grabbers are for some reason swapped as well, which is stupid and changed in my grabber visual update
22:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> yep
22:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> well ill make an issue
22:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> idk how it would be controversial
22:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> and i would merge it into my client if it was rejected
22:39 < bridge> <Assa> it would break existing maps, which are creating 2 doors on oppsite sites
22:39 < bridge> <Assa> so rejected üò†
22:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> wdym
22:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> doors arent animated ar they?
22:42 < bridge> <Assa> no, except for the old laser head ofc
22:42 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> @robyt3 its redundant to bounds check?
22:42 < bridge> <Assa> I mean that current maps work around the missing head by placing 2 doors instead of one
22:43 < bridge> <robyt3> I only meant the `ScreenY0 -= 0;` lines
22:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> also note that its useful here since offscreen text containers wont be updated
22:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> oh okay
22:43 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i kept them in because it was there at the start just commented it out
22:58 < bridge> <Property of Souly> the evil laser that kills you
23:00 < bridge> <Assa> did you see the latest orbs @hectavoxel ?
23:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> how can i purposely trigger an assert to check if the formatting is correct?
23:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> or do i just call it and wish its something readable xD

23:05 < bridge> <DDNet> Vote passed. essigautomat kicked by vote (stop complicating physics)
23:06 < bridge> <robyt3> You can patch some condition to true or false so the assertion is always reached
23:12 < bridge> <Property of Souly> yea
23:12 < bridge> <Property of Souly> i think they're alright
23:12 < bridge> <Property of Souly> i had my own idea for a design but it feels too late now
23:14 < bridge> <Assa> I didn't touch any physics in the last 10 PRs
23:15 < bridge> <Assa> Don't make me angry, or I'll fix door physics
23:17 < bridge> <Property of Souly> how are door physics broken again
23:19 < bridge> <Assa> doors don't actually have a hitbox, they just place stopper tiles
23:19 < bridge> <Assa> place a diagonal door and find out
23:20 < bridge> <Assa> And if I have a really bad day, I'll PR my maplayers refactoring
23:24 < bridge> <Property of Souly> i so wanna see how much chaos happens when you send your maplayer refactor
23:25 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> cant be worse than nameplates
23:25 < bridge> <Assa> it's a million tiles more readable, but @robyt3 will hate me, because there is a bug in Quad Counting which I can't find
23:25 < bridge> <Assa> .. üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ
23:25 < bridge> <robyt3> I never finished my own map layers refactoring
23:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i once tried to make entities layer transition alpha
23:26 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> :shudder:
23:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> @sollybunny now it happened to me aswell
23:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1355672361860464691/image.png?ex=67e9c7c6&is=67e87646&hm=e32fd8d3a660303b0e4be3386ed267f1a4fd7b5020d7792d0de09694342c6d7e&
23:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> damn you tater!
23:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> eh thats not as bad
23:38 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i keep trying to merge tclient with ddnet
23:38 < bridge> <melo∆û> xD
23:39 < bridge> <Ewan> about damn time
23:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> exactlyt my thoughts
23:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> i cant be bothered to wait for checks im just merging everything lmao
23:39 < bridge> <Solly (bun bun)> ill check it at the end ya know
