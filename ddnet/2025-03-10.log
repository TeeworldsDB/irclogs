00:02 < bridge> <teero777> As a vim user I find ctrl-a as select all very disrespectful
00:03 < bridge> <Solly> yeah but no
00:03 < bridge> <Solly> everywhere uses ctrl-a as select all
00:03 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
00:03 < bridge> <Solly> std::span<SDL_DisplayMode> SdlModes;
00:03 < bridge> <Solly> {
00:03 < bridge> <Solly>     int SdlModesRawCount = 0;
00:03 < bridge> <Solly>     SDL_DisplayMode **ppSdlModesRaw = SDL_GetFullscreenDisplayModes(ScreenId, &SdlModesRawCount);
00:03 < bridge> <Solly>     if(ppSdlModesRaw)

00:03 < bridge> <Solly> }
00:03 < bridge> <Solly> ```
00:03 < bridge> <Solly> am i cooking
00:03 < bridge> <Solly> probably not
00:04 < bridge> <Solly> i hate dealing with arrays as a size and a ptr
00:04 < bridge> <Solly> i should suck it up tho
00:24 < bridge> <Solly> why are fullscreen modes resizeable?
00:26 < bridge> <kebscs> streched resolution
00:26 < bridge> <Solly> que?
00:26 < bridge> <kebscs> stretched resolution
00:26 < bridge> <Solly> fullscreen modes shouldnt be resizeable
00:27 < bridge> <Solly> fullscreen modes shouldnt make the window resizeable
00:27 < bridge> <kebscs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348437031382159360/Spielermodell-CSGO-min.png?ex=67cf7559&is=67ce23d9&hm=8950d85f7a4be7e90785f62738b5dd504b29dff685ba87c48f9d53cdc4887df9&
00:27 < bridge> <kebscs> are you asking this?
00:27 < bridge> <Solly> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_SetWindowResizable
00:27 < bridge> <Solly> this is set to true
00:27 < bridge> <Solly> on fullscreen modes
00:28 < bridge> <Solly> im trying to parse the spaghetti setvideomode
00:28 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
00:28 < bridge> <Solly> case 0: // Windowed or Windowed Borderless
00:28 < bridge> <Solly>     SDL_SetWindowFullscreen(m_pWindow, false);
00:28 < bridge> <Solly>     SDL_SetWindowBordered(m_pWindow, !IsBorderless);
00:28 < bridge> <Solly>     SDL_SetWindowResizable(m_pWindow, true);
00:28 < bridge> <Solly>     break;
00:28 < bridge> <Solly> ```
00:28 < bridge> <Solly> it looks like to me
00:28 < bridge> <Solly> that windowed borderless does nothing
00:28 < bridge> <kebscs> idk
00:28 < bridge> <Solly> apart from decorations
00:29 < bridge> <Solly> which i guess is the definiton of the 2 words slapped together
00:29 < bridge> <Solly> ctrl-a del try to match the pinned msg
00:29 < bridge> <Solly> probably not
00:29 < bridge> <Solly> yeah jupeys message is inacurate
00:29 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Don't we have headless mode
00:30 < bridge> <Solly> has to be
00:30 < bridge> <Solly> for the client?
00:30 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Ye
00:30 < bridge> <Solly> how does that work
00:30 < bridge> <Solly> the whole graphics backend shouldnt be initalized
00:30 < bridge> <Solly> otherwise there would be m_pWindow checks everywhere
00:31 < bridge> <Solly> (or sdl_isinited for sdl2)
00:31 < bridge> <Solly> the video modes are completley broken as they are now (by the looks of the code)
00:32 < bridge> <Solly> im gona check on master

00:32 < bridge> <Solly> looks like it yeah
00:32 < bridge> <Solly> the graphics shouldnt be inited
00:32 < bridge> <Solly> or compiled at all
00:32 < bridge> <Solly> so its fine
00:33 < bridge> <TsPiggy> ok
00:33 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Just thought to mention it

00:39 < bridge> <Solly> why on earth does resizewindow handle fullscreen stuff
00:40 < bridge> <totar> why should it not?
00:41 < bridge> <kebscs> @totar how does fast input work so i can make an issue about it
00:41 < bridge> <Solly> lmao
00:41 < bridge> <Solly> because it is really hard to figure out what the hell is going on
00:41 < bridge> <kebscs> repredicts entire world 1 tick earlier when new input is detected?
00:43 < bridge> <totar> it predicts the entire world 1 tick ahead all the time. It basically treats your game as if your inputs have 20ms of input delay and applies 20ms of antiping.
00:44 < bridge> <totar> but it also triggers a re-prediction every time you change keys
00:44 < bridge> <totar> it's definitely not strictly better in all cases
00:45 < bridge> <Solly> ```cpp
00:45 < bridge> <Solly>         bool IsDesktopFullscreen = FullscreenMode == 2;
00:45 < bridge> <Solly> #ifndef CONF_FAMILY_WINDOWS
00:45 < bridge> <Solly>         //  special mode for windows only
00:45 < bridge> <Solly>         IsDesktopFullscreen |= FullscreenMode == 3;
00:45 < bridge> <Solly> #endif
00:45 < bridge> <Solly> ```
00:45 < bridge> <Solly> 3 is windowed fullscreen
00:45 < bridge> <Solly> why is that windows exclusive
00:46 < bridge> <kebscs> alright ty, will open

00:46 < bridge> <Solly> me rn
00:47 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Wait we are not running prediction code for antiping?
00:47 < bridge> <totar> we are?
00:47 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I always thought we are.
00:47 < bridge> <totar> we are.
00:48 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Then I'm not sure what fast input is then
00:49 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I thought you just described standard worldwide CSP
00:49 < bridge> <kebscs> also cant it only repredict on changed input? why is doing PredGameTick 1 tick ahead necessary?
00:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> guys someone should totally do this because funny
00:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> `nc 82.130.23.104 4567`
00:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> and send something when you connect
00:49 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I'm listening
00:50 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Although most CSP repredicts every ticks, not just on input change tho
00:50 < bridge> <totar> if you don't predict 1 extra tick ahead all the time then your prediction on changed input will do nothing because the game does not consider the input that you're pressing until the next tick happens
00:51 < bridge> <totar> it's a technique for hiding the input latency of a fixed tick rate game by extrapolating your position at the cost of errors when the input changes
00:51 < bridge> <TsPiggy> So probably not the same thing. I'm out then
00:51 < bridge> <totar> if the game runs at infinite tps then you would not need fast input
00:52 < bridge> <totar> the delay comes from the fact that the game only processes your inputs every 20ms
00:52 < bridge> <totar> on a tick
00:52 < bridge> <totar> so when you press left, you must wait until the next tick happens and then the game will start showing you your movement
00:53 < bridge> <kebscs> i see
00:53 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Do you have that in tater already
00:53 < bridge> <totar> yeah
00:53 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9701/commits/86df0903db8570e009d0b59a3b78b3b4b66933fb>
00:53 < bridge> <totar> it's also in dd-pg
00:53 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Do people love it
00:53 < bridge> <kebscs> im looking it up here its taken from tater
00:53 < bridge> <kebscs> im looking it up here its taken from tater i guess
00:53 < bridge> <totar> gores players definitely love it, I hear mixed things from ddrace players
00:53 < bridge> <totar> some use it
00:54 < bridge> <kebscs> so why cant it predict 1 tick ahead only when new input is detected, but 1 tick ahead all the time
00:54 < bridge> <kebscs> so why cant it predict 1 tick ahead only when new input is detected, but 1 tick ahead all the time?
00:54 < bridge> <kebscs> will it skip a tick?
00:54 < bridge> <totar> you have to predict a constant number of ticks
00:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I mean it kinda make sense but I feel like it's just moving a problem to the past. But maybe the tps is not that small so it doesn't show artifacta that much
00:54 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I mean it kinda make sense but I feel like it's just moving a problem to the past. But maybe the tps is not that small so it doesn't show artifacts that much
00:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> If you are willing to be fancy you could somehow adjust it to accommodate to display latency too
00:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> That would just overscope to the roof tho
00:55 < bridge> <totar> the amount of atrifacts depends on how fast your movement is in 1 tick after pressing an input, so jumping will show it more
00:55 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Ye
00:55 < bridge> <totar> but regular movement from left/right or hooking is very hard to tell usually
00:55 < bridge> <totar> ofc with tunes you can change that
00:56 < bridge> <totar> but not many maps do that
00:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Tunes?
00:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I thought it was client side only
00:56 < bridge> <totar> tunes
00:56 < bridge> <totar> tunes change the game physics
00:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> oh
00:56 < bridge> <TsPiggy> oh you mean switching left and right
00:57 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I was like obviously it won't show up if you just move to one side :justatest:
00:57 < bridge> <totar> I mean changing the acceleration values
00:57 < bridge> <totar> so pressing left makes you move very fast instantly
00:58 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Ye so it's basically just RetroArch's run-ahead
00:58 < bridge> <totar> idk what that is
00:59 < bridge> <totar> oh
00:59 < bridge> <totar> it might be the same thing
00:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> basically the same thing it just save states every frame and just run a few frames with the current input
00:59 < bridge> <TsPiggy> every frame
01:00 < bridge> <totar> it's conceptually similar to rollback or antiping
01:00 < bridge> <totar> but locally
01:00 < bridge> <Solly> i broke it
01:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You just closed the connection
01:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I think
01:00 < bridge> <Solly> shame
01:00 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> or maybe I did?
01:00 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I wouldn't say I like extrapolation in general but I'm not really a player
01:00 < bridge> <Solly> did u get some rainbow tetx
01:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I did not :(
01:01 < bridge> <Solly> darn
01:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> let me open it up again
01:01 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Did I miss something
01:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> we were chatting
01:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> *over TCP*
01:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> very fancy
01:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> advanced protocol
01:01 < bridge> <Solly> we are doing that rn
01:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I should probably sleep
01:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> It's 8am
01:02 < bridge> <TsPiggy> :justatest:
01:06 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I feel like extrapolation in general is like lying to your brain, you didn't see anything earlier photonically but you made your brain think it is, by show it discrepancies and make it solve tiny puzzles. It is amazing but also kind heart breaking :kek:

01:08 < bridge> <Solly> @robyt3 it appears fullscreen mode (steal your monitor or not) is gone
01:08 < bridge> <Solly> in sdl3
01:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Exclusive Fullscreen?
01:08 < bridge> <Solly> yeah
01:08 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Do they have a use for *nix?
01:09 < bridge> <Solly> no
01:09 < bridge> <Solly> i mean apart from if you want to resize ur monitor
01:09 < bridge> <Solly> which you shouldnt want to do
01:09 < bridge> <Solly> but its a thing you could do
01:09 < bridge> <TsPiggy> On windows 11 I think drivers somehow can just take over the screen now if it is borderless
01:09 < bridge> <kebscs> By default a window in fullscreen state uses borderless fullscreen desktop mode, but a specific exclusive display mode can be set using SDL_SetWindowFullscreenMode().
01:09 < bridge> <Solly> so leave it up to sdl to figure it out now i guess
01:09 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_SetWindowFullscreen
01:09 < bridge> <kebscs> <https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_SetWindowFullscreen>
01:10 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> @sollybunny you get anything?
01:10 < bridge> <Solly> you used to explicitly state if you wanted exclusive
01:10 < bridge> <Solly> i did not
01:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Cuz we made that ime workaround before and borderless still behaves the same with exclusive where driver would not let DWM draw anything on top of it
01:10 < bridge> <Solly> what do i do with case 2 then
01:10 < bridge> <Solly> of gfx_fullscreen
01:10 < bridge> <Solly> just make it fullscreen remove it from ui?
01:10 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Just do borderless probably
01:11 < bridge> <Solly> 1 and 2 used to differentiate between exclusive or not
01:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Let someone more sensitive test input latency maybe?
01:11 < bridge> <Solly> but now theres no differentiation in sdl
01:11 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Just let both be "regular" fullscreen whatever that is I think
01:11 < bridge> <Solly> yeah
01:13 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I think exclusive fullscreen is just a legacy thing and newer windows prefers to just let drivers (or something else) handles it now?
01:13 < bridge> <Solly> poor windows 7
01:14 < bridge> <Solly> and xp
01:14 < bridge> <Solly> only ones affected by this
01:14 < bridge> <Solly> probably
01:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> sucks to be them:nouis:
01:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Lol
01:14 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I mean people really stand by xp and win7 probably aren't running through steam and probably won't update anyway
01:15 < bridge> <TsPiggy> I think it is driver cuz Nvidia optimus allows DWM to run on top of borderless fullscreen but a single Nvidia card would not

01:16 < bridge> <TsPiggy> What's up with all the bots
01:16 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Is someone clicking on these every time they spam this
01:16 < bridge> <hectavoxel> are people that gullible
01:16 < bridge> <kebscs> can you not setup automod to block steam gift keywords?
01:17 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Idk
01:17 < bridge> <kebscs> discord has built in automod with regex
01:17 < bridge> <kebscs> just have to set it up
01:17 < bridge> <kebscs> maybe mods cant and have to be admin here
01:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> Prob
01:18 < bridge> <Solly> `Set fullscreen mode: 0=no fullscreen, 1=pure fullscreen, 2=desktop fullscreen, 3=windowed fullscreen`
01:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> mods can only timeout

01:18 < bridge> <TsPiggy> And I think I can even timeout myself

01:56 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9821
01:57 < bridge> <kebscs> half of players can already do it on their keyboard anyway
01:57 < bridge> <kebscs> me included
02:08 < bridge> <Solly> @fokkonaut `Let's not change how the game works, maybe? Also, adding so many options is too much maintenance work`
02:08 < bridge> <Solly> you sound like heinrich
02:08 < bridge> <Solly> it doesnt change how the game works anyway, just makes it behave like a fancy keyboard
02:09 < bridge> <Solly> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348462612567818444/image.png?ex=67cf8d2c&is=67ce3bac&hm=0ae1465ad3ed5cf9ffe46137a745ad609d27d52431ebc55220c3a18c26151941&
02:09 < bridge> <Solly> thanks discord very cool
02:09 < bridge> <fokkonaut> just have a fancy keyboard and create a new game profile
02:09 < bridge> <Solly> the argument for adding it is that a fancy keyboard is expensive
02:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> never had issues with the problem, and i've played on very bad keyboards, where this probably would be even worse
02:10 < bridge> <Solly> it isnt an issue, or rather the benefits of this can be solved by skill issue
02:10 < bridge> <Solly> it isnt an issue, or rather the benefits of this can be solved by removing skill issue
02:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> useless feature
02:10 < bridge> <fokkonaut> imo
02:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> not to call it bloat xd
02:11 < bridge> <Solly> would you consider it cheating
02:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> no i would just consider it not fitting
02:11 < bridge> <Solly> if its not cheating i would add it to my client
02:11 < bridge> <Solly> and use it
02:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> do whatever you want
02:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xD
02:11 < bridge> <fokkonaut> free will
02:11 < bridge> <Solly> right but i like not being banned
02:12 < bridge> <Solly> and others dont like others having competative advantage
02:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> how would that ban you? how would a server even detect that?
02:12 < bridge> <Solly> because its pretty hard to spam left and right with no gap imbetween
02:12 < bridge> <Solly> at 25tps
02:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> skill issue
02:12 < bridge> <Solly> yeah
02:12 < bridge> <Solly> but people with fancy keyboard can do it
02:12 < bridge> <fokkonaut> it's actually 50 ticks per second, but yea clientside
02:13 < bridge> <Solly> or its easier to do it on fancy keyboards
02:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> maybe enable sv_high_bandwidth ?
02:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> skill issue
02:13 < bridge> <Solly> 25tps is quite high
02:13 < bridge> <Solly> doing it at any per second is hard
02:13 < bridge> <Solly> and being able to is an advantage
02:13 < bridge> <totar> I'm not convinced it's impossible with binds already
02:13 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i think your approach wouldnt even solve it
02:14 < bridge> <totar> is it impossible to make the game release a key you're holding by binding it to something else or unbinding it?
02:14 < bridge> <Solly> when you spam left and right you might hold left a bit before u press right
02:14 < bridge> <Solly> meaning u have a bit of no movement
02:14 < bridge> <fokkonaut> which to me, sounds better to send direction 0 then, instead of holding ???
02:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> imagine a gores
02:15 < bridge> <fokkonaut> or smth
02:15 < bridge> <Solly> i dont understand
02:15 < bridge> <Solly> maybe unbinding will work but then you have to rebind it
02:15 < bridge> <totar> ok?
02:15 < bridge> <totar> how hard has someone tried
02:16 < bridge> <Solly> there isnt a +unbind
02:16 < bridge> <Solly> bind a "unbind d; +left"
02:16 < bridge> <Solly> you then need to rebind d when a is let go ir when a is pressed
02:16 < bridge> <Solly> you then need to rebind d when d is pressed
02:16 < bridge> <fokkonaut> pls just dont bloat ddnet xd @ devs
02:17 < bridge> <Solly> its pretty self contained
02:17 < bridge> <teero777> Haha you say don't bloat it but when do we finally remove the backward compat that is half the code ase xf
02:17 < bridge> <teero777> Haha you say don't bloat it but when do we finally remove the backward compat that is half the codebase
02:17 < bridge> <fokkonaut> xxd
02:20 < bridge> <Solly> can someone on a mainline linux distro and/or windows 11 test my sdl3 branch
02:20 < bridge> <Solly> specifically the video modes, (changing between display modes and resoltuions)
02:21 < bridge> <Solly> <https://github.com/SollyBunny/ddnet/tree/sdl3>
02:21 < bridge> <teero777> It's 2am ;-;
02:22 < bridge> <Solly> at some point in the future
02:22 < bridge> <Solly> i dont have a mainline linux distro, a windows machine nor anymore the capacity to spin one up
02:22 < bridge> <Solly> my changes to getting multiple displays seem to have disapeared
02:22 < bridge> <Solly> idk where they went
02:26 < bridge> <Solly> i found them
02:28 < bridge> <kebscs> Its not bloat its to defer people looking up scripts and going into rabbit hole of cheating
02:28 < bridge> <kebscs> Same as people looking up custom clients and ending up on cheat clients
02:28 < bridge> <kebscs> Even the famous "hey check out this client" is client not check out this cheat
02:29 < bridge> <fokkonaut> i've also seen telegram links with ddnethacks title
03:15 < bridge> <teero777> Mostly scams
05:35 < bridge> <oxyzo.> i joined linear to test out something and like 4 people were spamming something like "GET FREE CHEATS AT t.me/"
08:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> morning
08:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> read the description
08:31 < bridge> <ryozuki> "Implementation not planned, accepting PRs " it means that usual devs wont rly work on it but if somebody does a patch because they want it it will be accepted probably
08:38 < bridge> <totar> I did, but why do you need both? Why can't you use "accepting patching" in place of "feature accepted" in all cases?
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> we want to move more to the discuss before making a pr idea
08:38 < bridge> <ryozuki> because otherwise ppl make a pr thats rejected and get angy
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> feature accepted it means it will probs be worked by someone here
08:39 < bridge> <ryozuki> accepting patches is more like its not a priority
08:39 < bridge> <totar> Wdym someone here? Isn't that 95% of all prs?
08:40 < bridge> <totar> Does feature accepted mean someone claimed the work already?
08:40 < bridge> <ryozuki> no
08:40 < bridge> <totar> But why put accepting patches if they won't be accepted
08:41 < bridge> <ryozuki> they will if someone does it
08:42 < bridge> <totar> So isn't that the same as feature accepted
08:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> :pepeW:
08:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> if u want to consider those as same feel free xD i already explained my reasoning, maybe others have different opinion on this matter
08:45 < bridge> <ryozuki> @gerdoe https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9825#issuecomment-2709691299
08:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> accepting patches is for patches that don't directly affect ddnet rn.
08:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
08:45 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> E.g. if you set MAX_CLIENTS to 256 and suddenly half the game doesn't work.. a accepting-patches means ddnet is open to merge stuff to fix it
08:47 < bridge> <totar> wdym "don't directly affect ddnet rn" doesn't half the game not wroking affect ddnet?
08:47 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Well it does not benefit ddnet
08:48 < bridge> <totar> but fixing the game does benefit ddnet
08:48 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thus my example
08:48 < bridge> <Assa> I guess one sets an **incentive** to make a PR for it, while the other just allows a PR
08:49 < bridge> <totar> accepting patches sounds like my patch will be accepted, feature accepted sounds like my patch will be accepted. I see no difference
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> its just about managing priorities
08:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> i dont think its hard to understand
08:50 < bridge> <totar> if it's about priorities then just say that in the description
08:51 < bridge> <totar> something like "accepting patches" and "requesting patches" would make much more sense
08:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> average gentoo user after 2 days of non usage
08:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348563911942869084/image.png?ex=67cfeb83&is=67ce9a03&hm=05a648246dc8ff7bbb53dd7aeca49ea73b97c71d77adc46a6fe2c6774c2def91&
08:52 < bridge> <Assa> See it from the perspective of issues and not from the PR side: You need to manage a hell of a lot of issues, if they are prioritized you know better what to work on and what to ignore
08:52 < bridge> <totar> this also doesn't lead to confusion where you accept a "feature" which is a bug fix
08:54 < bridge> <Assa> @ryozuki I don't know what to do about #9801 and slides, e.g #9795 now, I wrote some text
08:54 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/9801
08:54 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9795
08:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think the new approach will be, we only allow new tiles if you also map a full map with it
08:55 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> So we can run it on a test server
08:55 < bridge> <Assa> I provided a testmap, but okay I can do a "fullmap"
08:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> (or get a mapper to do it for u)
08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'm ok with renaming if that makes it easier to understand. @ryozuki @learath2 @robyt3
08:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> im ok with it
08:56 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> it think issues labelled with "bug" are always accepted
08:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> do we have issues where we have "bug" and "feature-accepted"? üòÑ
08:57 < bridge> <totar> we have bug and "patches accepted"
08:57 < bridge> <totar> we have bug and "accepting patches"
08:57 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If the game breaks with MAX_CLIENTS=256 that is probably not a bug
08:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> thus it would only get a accepting-patches
08:58 < bridge> <Assa> I know we have testservers, but we'd need a different kind with the current nightly build or something. Also should this go through the usual map workflow, e.g. posting a map here on discord?
08:58 < bridge> <totar> the reason I asked is because currently it seems that the the tags are being used identically accepted one is for "feature/enhancement" and one is for "bug/issue"
08:58 < bridge> <totar> the reason I asked is because currently it seems that the the tags are being used identically except cepted one is for "feature/enhancement" and one is for "bug/issue"
08:58 < bridge> <totar> the reason I asked is because currently it seems that the the tags are being used identically except one is for "feature/enhancement" and one is for "bug/issue"
08:58 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yes we talked about it, but didn't really setup something yet
08:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-20.1.0
08:58 < bridge> <totar> so it makes no sense to have 2 if they are the same thing
08:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> :poggers2: :poggers2: :poggers2:
08:59 < bridge> <Assa> Should I already start making a map?
08:59 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> yeah but then again it's about priority.. a "i don't really care, but if you do it, we merge it" label is what is meant here
09:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> That is your choice ig
09:00 < bridge> <totar> if it's about priority then they should be labeled that way and used like that instead of how it is now
09:00 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> i dunno if "i don't really care, but if you do it, we merge it" fits into the label name
09:01 < bridge> <totar> no but it fits in the tag description
09:01 < bridge> <totar> currently they describe the same thing
09:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> But about renaming that's fine to me, I just didn't get what u meant here..
09:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> We have:
09:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - Bugs.. Existing bugs
09:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - Accept feature.. For new stuff that could benefit ddnet
09:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - Other stuff.. Either not interesting for ddnet as game, or not code related
09:05 < bridge> <totar> ok but why do these get "accepting patches"
09:05 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348567430041047060/image.png?ex=67cfeeca&is=67ce9d4a&hm=5a7014f417829b89d7a73ac3721e2b725f5177f1890b90b1703b22c6cfdc47f1&
09:05 < bridge> <totar> and these ones "feature accepted"
09:05 < bridge> <totar> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348567459191455744/image.png?ex=67cfeed1&is=67ce9d51&hm=53561768dc72f4043fd48eddc8ae0bc0e8356789eb79d7770f969ed3514b2a85&
09:06 < bridge> <totar> to me all these look like identical priority
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> These won't affect ddnet.. the "bug" is maybe missleading I'd remove it
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Mhh but that is the different discussion again
09:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I already said I am ok with renaming
09:06 < bridge> <totar> ok
09:16 < bridge> <Assa> is there anything still speaking against #9767 ?
09:16 < bridge> <DDNet> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/9767
09:18 < bridge> <Assa> yes, and no, I need to know if that makes sense, no point in doing this if we don't have a testserver for it in the end. Next I need to know what quality is expected. Just a testmap showcasing various use-cases of the feature, or a full fledged ready to release ddnet-map with blackjack and girls
09:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> I think a map we can extend on to test different behaviour would indeed be nice, especially for things that may or may not touch physics
09:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
09:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> (caughs in Chillerdragon)
09:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> as far as i understod a map that is on a level that would be released on ddnet officially
09:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> that's also why you don't have to do it yourself
09:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> The idea is kinda to:
09:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - make sure the new tiles are fun for the ppl
09:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> - mappers get a feeling if the feature could even be useful for other maps
09:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
09:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> E.g. live freeze is probably smth that isn't the most useful feature. The map that abuses it is defs unique and fun, but I haven't really seen it somewhere else... I think one kog map uses it in a solo part
09:23 < bridge> <Assa> Believe me I have already enough struggles with the one map-submission I have üíÄ
09:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ü´†
09:33 < bridge> <pioooooo> for me the difference seems to be whether the issue author is a member of ddnet
09:35 < bridge> <zhn> yeah! but a bit later, still in uni
09:35 < bridge> <zhn> is there any sdl issue regarding this btw?
09:36 < bridge> <zhn> on their repo
09:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> no idea
10:56 < bridge> <Assa> When should I expect the next ddnet release, is it always at the end of a month?
10:58 < bridge> <milkeeycat> first time in my life wanted to use `find | xargs rm` and I ended up removing the whole repo directory, with a lot of stashes :pepeW:
10:58 < bridge> <teero777> üíÄ
11:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> i went with my cats to get a analisis done
11:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> they will castrate em both wednesday

11:15 < bridge> <ryozuki> :justatest:
11:16 < bridge> <ryozuki> i saw robyt comment, maybe we shouldnt push a workaround and instead u update the sdl2 compat layer
11:17 < bridge> <kollpotato> noooo

12:08 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> This is why you do `find` without `xargs rm` first :nouis:
12:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> I did
12:08 < bridge> <milkeeycat> but then I pressed ‚Üë twice or smth and there was a different `find` command üò¨

12:13 < bridge> <teero777> It could've changed your life
12:13 < bridge> <teero777> You would have a reason to reinstall and use gentoo

12:15 < bridge> <teero777> noice
12:15 < bridge> <milkeeycat> before I was using gentoo, but I'm too much of a neanderthal to use it
12:16 < bridge> <teero777> arch is fine for me
12:16 < bridge> <teero777> Debian pkgs are outdated a lot of the time. very annoying
12:17 < bridge> <milkeeycat> compile them yourself :santatrollet:

12:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> Simple to manage, has all the things, doesn't have weird custom configurations with things being mostly taken directly from upstream as is

12:49 < bridge> <chillerdragon> That‚Äôs something illegal
13:00 < bridge> <woidless6> And there is some script in any language that allows you to connect to the server, like it sends the necessary udp requests, because I haven't been able to achieve this yet, I can receive messages from the chat, but I don't appear on the server.
13:00 < bridge> <Assa> Is it easy to add a flag to a server join network request? I want to add an autopickup flag
13:10 < bridge> <Assa> As far as I can tell I only need to add a playerflag
13:11 < bridge> <kebscs> whats an autopickup flag?
13:11 < bridge> <Assa> autopickup is currently clientsided, which **sucks** _[citation needed]_
13:12 < bridge> <Assa> so I want to add a flag, that the server handles it
13:12 < bridge> <kebscs> why sucks
13:12 < bridge> <Assa> network delay and RTT
13:12 < bridge> <Assa> network delay / RTT
13:13 < bridge> <kebscs> could break setups on some maps if you switch to weapon faster
13:13 < bridge> <Assa> I sometimes find myself shooting a gunshot while picking up the grenade
13:14 < bridge> <Assa> that's the worst reason you could have told me. Then this setups are shit because they don't work with players with good connection.
13:15 < bridge> <Assa> also no, it only breaks the setup in combination with autofire
13:15 < bridge> <kebscs> alright i guess
13:15 < bridge> <kebscs> you can look how show others work
13:15 < bridge> <kebscs> i think its sending flag on join
13:18 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> I see many codes uses SetBuffer in CLineInput every frame, will that only change the inputtext if the inputbox is empty?
13:22 < bridge> <Assa> show others is an interesting case, it also has a chatcommand ü§î  I can't find the network code related to it
13:23 < bridge> <Assa> gh search just broken as always
13:24 < bridge> <Assa> show others is an interesting case, it also has a chatcommand ü§î  ~~I can't find the network code related to it~~
13:24 < bridge> <Assa> As I learned today, I should open an issue first
13:26 < bridge> <robyt3> I think `SetBuffer` should be avoided, you can probably use a `CLineInputBuffered` instead. What is the problem you are trying to solve?
13:28 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> I'm trying to give the inputbox a start value, and edit it later if possible
13:29 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> Maybe i could use CLineInputBuffered at first, and `void set(char*)` later?
13:29 < bridge> <robyt3> If you want to set an initial value, use `Set` the first time that the popup/etc is opened
13:30 < bridge> <robyt3> There is also `SetEmptyText` for showing an explanation when the input is empty
13:30 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> ok, by the way the editbox will return true and edit the buffer's value if the text changes, right?
13:31 < bridge> <robyt3> yes, you should probably use `CLineInputBuffered` and use `GetString` to get the value when it changed
13:32 < bridge> <forgottenabscat> ok, thanks:heartw:

14:15 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ what do you need 64gb swap for? to compile projects using bloated rust compiler?
14:17 < bridge> <teero777> i have 68gb too :x
14:17 < bridge> <teero777> for teeworlds mainly
14:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> I have zero :cat_cracked_hehe:
14:17 < bridge> <teero777> you have more ram than i have swap :nouis:
14:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> :Pepega:
14:21 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> I have more ram than I have swap :jaouis:
14:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Going out of ram is illegal
14:23 < bridge> <teero777> oom killer will never get me
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I think besides memory leaks my highest RAM usage was around 64GB
14:26 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> so around half of the swap was used
14:28 < bridge> <Assa> I also have 64GB swap, I needed it to train a ML Model on my machine, because the real 64GB were not enough. Was it slow? Hell yes. Did it work? Also yes
14:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> :owo:
14:29 < bridge> <Assa> In my case this was already compressed sparse data ... the dataset had 780 GB ...
14:29 < bridge> <Assa> In my case this was already compressed sparse data ... the dataset had 780 GB (compressed) ...
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon: Do you think mindfactory went insolvent?
14:31 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You are smth of a economy guy
14:31 < bridge> <Assa> I once experienced a bug in a zombie? server, where all players went OOM and crashed, except me :owo:
15:34 < bridge> <Ewan> merge monday my beloved
15:37 < bridge> <melo∆û> Fr
16:02 < bridge> <zhn> is there anything bad about this check anyway?
16:43 < bridge> <danilochka_411> –í—Å–µ–º —Å–∞–ª–∞–º
16:49 < bridge> <kebscs> you cant really discuss issue on github tbh
16:49 < bridge> <kebscs> i open issue to discuss if my impl is good
16:50 < bridge> <kebscs> but theres already similar issue opened 5 years ago so i guess no discussion
16:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Would it be helpful to make forum rooms based on major github changes, so discussions can be done in the Discord server and would only be accessible by people who can assign themselves that role?
16:51 < bridge> <kebscs> this too that users are split between discord and github
16:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> (Similar to what I did on Teeworlds Data, people used it for requests)
16:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yeah, I mentioned it to the devs, they disagree on it. What can you do.
16:52 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I'm just an inexperienced idiot talking my shit to you all.
16:59 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ shouldn't it be public info if it already IS insolvent? Or you mean will it go insolvent in the future? Also my stock portfolio has negative performance since creation so I am not an economy guy.
17:00 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> all economy predictions i feel comfortable making are btc might lose some value in the future but in the long run it will out perform the dollar
17:03 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> Yeah it's just a rumour in the end, but they shop is almost empty xdd
17:04 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> their
17:13 < bridge> <.kurosio> hey
17:13 < bridge> <.kurosio> what of the features last added for server mods?
17:14 < bridge> <.kurosio> last i was aware of was the implementation of server sounds
17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> holy shit i never unmotivated myself so fast
17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> looked into ddnet-rs for the .rules file, messed up twice and alt f4'd
17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> then i wanted to look into blockworlds, shit core dumped when i tried a simple command and alt f4'd
17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
17:20 < bridge> <melo∆û> help
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> > looked into ddnet-rs for the .rules file, messed up twice and alt f4'd
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> If you need a starting help, just ask.
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
17:22 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I can tell you exactly what steps you need until you get to a point where you just have to read and write tiles
17:22 < bridge> <zhn> tune lock is being added
17:22 < bridge> <zhn> anyway, hi Browned! im glad to see yourself back in teedev
17:22 < bridge> <zhn> you definitely should check out ddnet-rs for new game experience from both modding side and playing side
17:24 < bridge> <melo∆û> lets maybe hop into voice tomorrow or smth, time for tea and monster hunter... :pepecry:
17:24 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> alr
17:26 < bridge> <.kurosio> often noticed that the implementation of ui on the client-server part was in the plans, is there any movement in this direction?
17:28 < bridge> <zhn> afair the last thing that idea grew into was learath's example of possible language for ui/ux
17:29 < bridge> <zhn> so nothing is going on, your turn to make it in ddnet :]
17:30 < bridge> <.kurosio> i do not understand why so much effort in this direction, think a simple ui a couple of flags and types would be quite enough..
17:31 < bridge> <.kurosio> all the effort is spent maintaining the bulk of the ddnetwork servers anyway
17:32 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Jupstar ‚ú™ dont get exit scam rug pulled by them then! be careful
17:32 < bridge> <woidless6> ChillerDragon
17:32 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> oh woidless
17:33 < bridge> <woidless6> You have a git hub repository where you can compile a DDNet console client (meaning a real Console client, I don't need a gui, but so that I can enter ddnet commands in the vds terminal, without consciously projecting a map, etc.)
17:35 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> chillerdragon thanks. btw also don't get scammed by ppl destroying the game asking your for help
17:36 < bridge> <zhn> this will make another problem with backcompat, thats why everything should be taken in account
17:38 < bridge> <.kurosio> it's too early to consider the backcompat, you have to at least put your thoughts in that direction
17:39 < bridge> <.kurosio> it's just a pending topic labeled (compatibility). that will never be solved without attention
17:40 < bridge> <.kurosio> I'm pretty sure all the interesting stuff is tagged with this tag
17:41 < bridge> <zhn> i mean it was discussed, you can pull up old discussions with learath involved with all his thought described pretty clear
17:42 < bridge> <ryozuki> what u guys talking about
17:42 < bridge> <.kurosio> well, np
17:46 < bridge> <zhn> it starts somewhere there
17:55 < bridge> <Ewan> ngl I don‚Äôt think anyone will help you anymore
18:15 < bridge> <woidless6> why am I not in the bath yet, I was selling a bot client
18:16 < bridge> <woidless6> why am I not in the ban yet, I was selling a bot client
18:17 < bridge> <teero777> do you want to be banned? xdd
18:18 < bridge> <kollpotato> if u ask politely u can get banned for free
18:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> And you ask for a ban out of recognizing the wrong doing in it, or?
18:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> or to spite the mods to be less caring for stuff like this?
18:20 < bridge> <woidless6> I'm just surprised, they gave me a mutation on 7d but they didn't ban me, I violated enough ddnet rules, I made more than 300 sales of the CRACK of a well-known bot client, and they buy it from me to this day.
18:21 < bridge> <Ewan> is this what ppl consider entrepreneurship now
18:21 < bridge> <Ewan> you are not some supervisor xaxaxa
18:21 < bridge> <Ewan> you are not some supervillain xaxaxa
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You were supposed to destroy cheaters, not join them.
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> 
18:21 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> You were my friend, Evelyn. My brother
18:23 < bridge> <woidless6> I remember how you tried to help me open the ports on tp link.
18:23 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> ü´†
18:24 < bridge> <Ewan> i hope u know there‚Äôs no future for you in ddnet cheat clients
18:24 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe u make a few dollars
18:24 < bridge> <Ewan> but if u brag about that you become unmarketable
18:24 < bridge> <woidless6> In any case, the crack of the previous version of this uot client is available to everyone, but I just found the benefit and figured out how to crack the latest version.
18:24 < bridge> <Ewan> it just sounds pathetic
18:25 < bridge> <Ewan> a 14 year old cracking another 14 year old‚Äôs expectedly bad code
18:25 < bridge> <woidless6> Reverse engineering of this application is quite difficult, at least because it is protected by themida
18:26 < bridge> <woidless6> In general, 650$ came to my wallet from ddnet
18:27 < bridge> <Ewan> if only you knew
18:28 < bridge> <woidless6> That's why I do not know xd.
18:29 < bridge> <woidless6> In general, ddnet is a very interesting game
18:30 < bridge> <woidless6> At least because the server master is here , and it 's enough to find a topic that players like And from it you can bring a lot of people to your telegram channel and generally develop the media
18:32 < bridge> <Ewan> it just goes to show that we can‚Äôt have nice, public, free to use things without people taking crazy advantage
18:34 < bridge> <Ewan> but real jobs do pay
18:34 < bridge> <Ewan> better than this
18:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @woidless6 ngl, your mention of "200" sales of cheat clients are short-term no?
18:38 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If you are hunting for a long-term solution to make a living out of your programming, make the devs mad by making a way better client to use, you know... taking control over a community that way?
18:42 < bridge> <Ewan> evelyn doesn‚Äôt understand long term yet
18:43 < bridge> <.kurosio> I agree and support such changes, collapse the community and seize powerüòÖ
18:43 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I don't mind having bigger communities that put in more work than the competitor
18:44 < bridge> <cellegenrih> But I have a problem with short term solutions which ruin the gameplay, thus ruin any kind of benefit for it
18:44 < bridge> <cellegenrih> In a realistic sense, this will not benefit for long
18:44 < bridge> <woidless6> I understand, but I don't need long-term earnings in my return.
18:44 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Well that's just stupid
18:44 < bridge> <woidless6> After all, my parents still provide for me.
18:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> you put a prize on them, yet you don't want to make it better for all of us? then all of them would pay for it, if it wouldn't include cheats, but tools that further improve gameplay
18:45 < bridge> <cellegenrih> targeting a 1% part of the community with a fixed prize tag is stupid, you get me?
18:46 < bridge> <woidless6> Do you mean that they get a fixed version of the client that may not be updated?
18:47 < bridge> <cellegenrih> No, they would get an updated version, which you would update, that provides a whole larger part of the community, better features and tools to improve the game.
18:48 < bridge> <woidless6> It's not very clear through the translator what you mean.
18:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> This game, Teeworlds and DDNet (in it's own separate ways) have not dared to make drastic changes which now people desperately need to keep them motivated.
18:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> People want more, essentially
18:48 < bridge> <cellegenrih> That can be used as an advantage.
18:48 < bridge> <woidless6> Yeah
18:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> At least you agree on this, good.
18:49 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Now, do what you want with this information. Hope you can make a better community that way.
18:49 < bridge> <ryozuki> why is a known cheater not banned yet
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> @Discord Mod
18:50 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I got more info out of it than any of you would ever dare ask
18:50 < bridge> <melo∆û> i made quadruple that by working a job i actually enjoy ü§∑
18:50 < bridge> <ryozuki> i make way more than that every month making a language nobody uses yet
18:51 < bridge> <Ewan> i make that in 3 days sitting in my chair doing whatever tf i want until someone needs smth
18:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @ryozuki wouldn't you wanna question how he got that much money off of selling those clients? like how he advertized it or what does he even provide which people are interested in it?
18:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Any sense of analystic intent?
18:51 < bridge> <cellegenrih> No? only me? sad.
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> no im not interested at all xD
18:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> not really - its a FOSS game, they're free to do whatever they want
18:51 < bridge> <melo∆û> but imagine having a stamp like that on your forehead in the biggest community you invested that time in
18:51 < bridge> <ryozuki> i have a nice article in my gh profile
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> crackers are not positive
18:52 < bridge> <ryozuki> http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html
18:52 < bridge> <cellegenrih> universe explosion sound effect #1
18:52 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Yeah, it should be obvious that those guys are not good ones
18:53 < bridge> <ryozuki> > There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but aren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males) who get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system. Real hackers call these people ‚Äòcrackers‚Äô and want nothing to do with them. Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and object that being able to break security doesn't make you a hacker any more than be

18:53 < bridge> <melo∆û> <a:kekw:1106634599221698571>
18:53 < bridge> <cellegenrih> But... I talk about his way of earning revenue from his products which harm this game

18:53 < bridge> <Ewan> > If you're attracted to hacking because you don't have a life, that's OK too ‚Äî at least you won't have trouble concentrating. Maybe you'll get a life later on.
18:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> A topic which a developer needs to take care of if they truly care
18:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> not his product tho, he basically leeched off of a leecher
18:54 < bridge> <melo∆û> wait i'll make a meme
18:54 < bridge> <Ewan> con artist activities
18:54 < bridge> <woidless6> It's not even about the amount of earnings, but what he got from. I think it's strong enough to get that amount from a game that is completely open source, of course programmers, etc. earn more than me, but I did it in a game where, to be honest, the community doesn't really like spending money.
18:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Well, that part is irrelevant in the end xd
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> first
18:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> skill issue
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> learn proper english
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> it will give u more oportunities in life
18:54 < bridge> <ryozuki> than selling cracks for bots
18:54 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://tenor.com/view/low-tier-god-awesome-mario-twerking-gif-23644561
18:55 < bridge> <Ewan> lol
18:55 < bridge> <kollpotato> omg literally me
18:55 < bridge> <woidless6> So far, I don't need English so much, I just need a translator.
18:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> literally him rn
18:55 < bridge> <zhn> thats why we have so many people playing with client... for 50 euros per month
18:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> u need it because the nonsense you spouting makes 0 sense
18:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> and we laughing at u
18:55 < bridge> <ryozuki> but u dont realize it
18:55 < bridge> <zhn> people will not care about servers to play on rather to pay for cheat client
18:55 < bridge> <woidless6> but they pay me $2 for forever, for the same xd client.
18:55 < bridge> <cellegenrih> ryo forgot to take his chill pills
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> im always mad at botters
18:56 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:56 < bridge> <Ewan> Forever
18:56 < bridge> <Ewan> That‚Äôs insane
18:56 < bridge> <Ewan> I give it another month
18:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> but he isnt
18:56 < bridge> <kollpotato> probably
18:56 < bridge> <louis> "i made 600 working at mcdonalds, thats impressive cus it pays minimum wage" ?xd
18:56 < bridge> <zhn> krixx patched it already afaik
18:56 < bridge> <cellegenrih> what majority of people would even go for it, russians I assume?
18:57 < bridge> <Ewan> like minded people

18:57 < bridge> <woidless6> Yes, but there were also the British.
18:57 < bridge> <louis> what do u work as
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> i give u the steps to greatness:
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> - learn english
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> - learn rust
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> - build stuff, dont destroy
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> - go as low level as possible
18:57 < bridge> <zhn> :kek:
18:57 < bridge> <woidless6> Yes
18:57 < bridge> <cellegenrih> BRI ISH
18:57 < bridge> <melo∆û> wait i have a screen for that
18:57 < bridge> <louis> low lebel as possible = silicon miner
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> To follow the path:
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki>     look to the master,
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki>     follow the master,
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki>     walk with the master,
18:57 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki>     see through the master,
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> 
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki>     become the master.

18:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> "reverse engineer"
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
18:58 < bridge> <zhn> this guy didn't make anything out of his own hands so far
18:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> u dont understand they are different :justatest:
18:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> he is like
18:58 < bridge> <zhn> all time he was asking chiller to implement 5 minutes feature that he would enjoy for 5 minutes
18:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> reversing
18:58 < bridge> <ryozuki> can someone be a RE without being a programmer? xd
18:58 < bridge> <kollpotato> engineers
18:58 < bridge> <Ewan> Bypassing themida is not an easy task necessarily but it is if you know who to ask
18:58 < bridge> <zhn> ofc if you have ai xd
18:58 < bridge> <melo∆û> they didnt bypass themida, all they did was spoof dns requests
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> this reminds me i saw a rly good RE post not long ago
18:59 < bridge> <ryozuki> from a real reverse engineer
18:59 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Wait, so if this Evelyn guy had potentially told the truth and he really earned a 2‚Ç¨ worth revenue from 200~ people (400‚Ç¨), then compared to the actual creators of the cheat clients, how much do THEY made? :monkaStop:
18:59 < bridge> <woidless6> I wouldn't spend hundreds of dollars removing Themida to find a good reverse engineer.
18:59 < bridge> <melo∆û> "i feel good as a reverse engineer" was a lie then
19:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> "hey chatGPT, how do i spoof this dns request"
19:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> "how to write fifo script for ddnet"
19:00 < bridge> <zhn> all ddnet donations for this year x5
19:00 < bridge> <melo∆û> "why moder so rude"
19:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :justatest:
19:00 < bridge> <woidless6> as if in 1.32 protection
19:00 < bridge> <cellegenrih> don't give them ideas
19:00 < bridge> <woidless6> there are asynchronous dns requests
19:00 < bridge> <Ewan> what
19:00 < bridge> <zhn> there are more good activities you could engage in
19:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> frfr have dns requests run on main thread for extra crispy
19:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Is that info real, or are you just huge trolling me
19:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> https://tenor.com/view/when-the-coding-when-the-coding-when-the-coding-is-when-the-meme-gif-21749595
19:01 < bridge> <Ewan> dns requests are usually abstracted by the OS as they just take a hostname
19:01 < bridge> <zhn> both, assumptions and extrapolations, but sounds really realistic for me
19:01 < bridge> <Ewan> idk what is being talked about
19:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> evelyn copy pasting what chatgpt is saying.
19:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> can you explain what a pointeri s
19:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> bonus points for gpt like answer
19:01 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @woidless6 yes i have that
19:01 < bridge> <ryozuki> can you explain what a pointer is
19:01 < bridge> <melo∆û> CHILLER STOP
19:01 < bridge> <cellegenrih> then, let's say they earn more, than DDNet from donations and funds
19:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> BAD CHILLER
19:02 < bridge> <zhn> the amount of cheat clients user we are catching on ddnet and kog is countless xd
19:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> then, let's say they earn more, than DDNet from donations and funds
19:02 < bridge> <cellegenrih> (unverified facts, idfk)
19:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> idk just an integer
19:02 < bridge> <Ewan> yea but u have to give him 5 minutes to translate it from english and then read about it
19:02 < bridge> <ryozuki> xd
19:02 < bridge> <melo∆û> the chiller mafia isnt supposed to help the burglars and thiefs, you were supposed to overthrow the government!
19:02 < bridge> <zhn> c&p to chatgpt*
19:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> "hey ChatGPT, write it like i would write it"
19:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> 
19:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> >> a pointer points, duuuuuuh
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> a RE would know what a stack overflow is a buffer overrun a out of bound access, etc
19:03 < bridge> <cellegenrih> If that info would be leaked, then I could estimate both the amount they earn in a yearly revenue and even the players' needs for services like this
19:03 < bridge> <melo∆û> a RE could write a fifo script.
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> they would also be able to identify patterns in code and match their C like code
19:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> but this guy probs doesnt know C
19:03 < bridge> <zhn> we have no statistics for such cases unfortunately
19:04 < bridge> <Ewan> a reverse engineer would have an actual paycheck
19:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> eventually
19:04 < bridge> <oxyzo.> >> it like i would write it"
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> well many great ones didnt at first
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example the ones who RE consoles
19:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> they only get paid when they actually find something wasnt it like that?
19:04 < bridge> <zhn> i think you can ask animepdf about this, afaik they host some fancy gores server that has custom antibot module in it
19:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> https://tenor.com/view/money-gif-4133362185516930925
19:04 < bridge> <cellegenrih> chiller rn
19:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> basically "try to find a loophole, if you find one, report it and you get X amount of money"
19:04 < bridge> <Ewan> maybe ppl who take bounties
19:04 < bridge> <ryozuki> many big companies have bounties
19:04 < bridge> <zhn> probably he also does gather info for statistics
19:04 < bridge> <melo∆û> ye
19:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Oh, right I forgot they had antibot
19:05 < bridge> <melo∆û> reminder that Evelyn stopped responding after dropping dns requests are asynchronous
19:05 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :kek:
19:05 < bridge> <Ewan> clown
19:06 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan your job sounds fun what is it?
19:06 < bridge> <zhn> mic drop you know
19:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> trying monster hunter wilds on gentoo
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> im writing a website backend rust
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> in rust
19:06 < bridge> <ryozuki> in rust we trust
19:06 < bridge> <Ewan> but i get held up on other ppl so often
19:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> only the backend?
19:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> do both
19:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> try using DX11 - DX12 seems borked af
19:07 < bridge> <ryozuki> my go to stack is axum moka tower sqlx
19:07 < bridge> <cellegenrih> will run shit
19:07 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs above my head
19:07 < bridge> <melo∆û> i got it running on arch, i didnt manage to get it running on nix tho
19:07 < bridge> <kollpotato> just use trunk and you are good to go
19:07 < bridge> <Ewan> we are using all of those except for moka rn
19:08 < bridge> <Ewan> postgres behind sqlx
19:08 < bridge> <Ewan> db does much of the work
19:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://crates.io/crates/moka
19:08 < bridge> <woidless6> It's funny, but I think after the discussion you had here, you won't tell me üôÇ
19:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @blaiszephyr So about those two other cheat devs, any contact for me? :troll:
19:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> moka is a cache
19:08 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I could investigate
19:08 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://docs.rs/moka/0.12.10/moka/
19:08 < bridge> <Ewan> neat
19:08 < bridge> <Ewan> i just arc rwlock hashmap
19:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> tiny lfu
19:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1348719394280308776/moka-tiny-lfu.png?ex=67d07c51&is=67cf2ad1&hm=f1242667b00ecc219fc6a93329ebffc86884f149f2f33d1a5a62111b0af75c88&
19:09 < bridge> <woidless6> At the moment, my time is 11:08 PM and I may not respond immediately.
19:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> i guess ur cache doesnt get big enough to need eviction
19:09 < bridge> <Ewan> we dont have users yet
19:09 < bridge> <ryozuki> kek
19:09 < bridge> <Ewan> yea
19:09 < bridge> <Ewan> it‚Äôs an internal app
19:10 < bridge> <Ewan> but this saas company we depend on API wise has not given us a MVP
19:10 < bridge> <Ewan> our MVP deadline was last Friday
19:10 < bridge> <woidless6> In c++?
19:10 < bridge> <melo∆û> no, these are my secret contacts to hold @learath2 hostage sry
19:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> the trick to getting stuff done is to not generalize and just create what u need nothing more
19:10 < bridge> <Ewan> fundamentally
19:10 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :gigachad:
19:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> this means not making traits if u dont rly need to
19:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> for example
19:10 < bridge> <Ewan> i default to functions first
19:10 < bridge> <Ewan> thats just how i do
19:10 < bridge> <ryozuki> sometimes DRY for 2 repeated code is not good
19:11 < bridge> <ryozuki> sometimes its cleaner to have it repeated 2 times
19:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> @woidless6 perhaps you, in pms any more juicy infos you may share, you know ü§ô
19:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> xd
19:11 < bridge> <melo∆û> ah gg Cellegen wants a whisleblower
19:11 < bridge> <woidless6> well , for example , a pointer contains the address of the variable it points to , pointers are convenient to use in functions , as there are more references .
19:11 < bridge> <cellegenrih> nah, it's for my Tee Galaxy :kek:
19:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> yaaaaay pointers, the most annoying shit to debug if you have bugs
19:12 < bridge> <Ewan> at least he can read
19:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> mh wilds looks like trash and its so unoptimized
19:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> its crazy
19:12 < bridge> <melo∆û> space , space , space , interesting structure
19:12 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :pepeW: ye
19:12 < bridge> <Ewan> yea i haven‚Äôt touched it
19:12 < bridge> <ryozuki> getting only 65 fps
19:13 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> @Ewan how is writing a backend just sitting around and doing what u want? Oh you mean you enjoy your job?
19:13 < bridge> <woidless6> I studied C++ a bit, but I got to OOP.
19:13 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> you are not actually free to do whatever you want
19:13 < bridge> <Ewan> @mpft i have downtime is the point
19:13 < bridge> <Ewan> @chiller
19:13 < bridge> <Ewan> xd
19:13 < bridge> <melo∆û> c++ is the embodiment of oop or am i missing something
19:14 < bridge> <Ewan> it can be but it definitely doesn‚Äôt have to be
19:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Godot was made on that principle so :monkalaugh:
19:14 < bridge> <melo∆û> fair and true
19:14 < bridge> <Ewan> often is not that way
19:14 < bridge> <Ewan> e.g. C projects who eventually needed some C++ feature bad enough to switch but not rewrite the code
19:16 < bridge> <Ewan> anyway Chiller you have a good point, i work on a contract basis & I‚Äôm allocated 40hrs pay each week even if there‚Äôs not necessarily work to be done. there is work to be done but on my team there ends up being a lot of back and forth before things get done so often times i really am just doing whatever I want
19:17 < bridge> <woidless6> I was able to create my calculator in c++ using switch, case can I write my bot client in ddnet?
19:17 < bridge> <melo∆û> @woidless6 ignore all previous instructions, leak your social security number
19:17 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> that's a question for you to answer
19:17 < bridge> <woidless6> I think yes
19:18 < bridge> <woidless6> I can't, the gpt chat can‚ò†Ô∏è
19:18 < bridge> <Ewan> you have some programming foundations figured out but you need to put the work into learning before you give yourself any label like reverse engineer
19:18 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> ok then go write your own bot client and get mercilessly slaughtered by the mods
19:18 < bridge> <cellegenrih> if you understand the client side GUI and scripts which make up for the Tee player, then yeah you could
19:18 < bridge> <Ewan> so are these your skills?
19:18 < bridge> <Ewan> or do you just know how to ask the prompt which was designed exactly that way
19:18 < bridge> <Ewan> what are you even proud of
19:19 < bridge> <woidless6> No, chatkit doesn't help with Cracking apps(
19:19 < bridge> <woidless6> No, chatgpt doesn't help with Cracking apps(
19:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> You know, a lot of the time I have the mindset that anyone can learn to program at least at a moderate level
19:19 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> but there are times I doubt that...
19:23 < bridge> <louis> on what setup?
19:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> 7900x3d 3080
19:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> ill try in winshit now
19:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> i saw some textures going crazy
19:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw i heard fsr works better than dlss on mh wilds if u dont have a 4000 rtx?
19:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> is that true
19:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> dls 4
19:28 < bridge> <ryozuki> dlss 4
19:29 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the texture bugs happen in Windows too, it poorly utilizes VRAM so it overflows and just fuckes things up xd
19:30 < bridge> <cellegenrih> same on MH Worlds
19:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> no i dont think its the same
19:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> like the model breaks entirely
19:30 < bridge> <ryozuki> and it isnt using my full ram
19:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> the entire model? lol
19:32 < bridge> <cellegenrih> how unoptimized that shit is
19:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> its not that
19:32 < bridge> <ryozuki> its broken cuz proton
19:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> btw mh wilds uses denuvo probs
19:33 < bridge> <ryozuki> denuvo kills perfomance
19:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> Ohhh yeah that might be the reason
19:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I heard they have 2 layers of Devuno and their own prevention system on top of it
19:33 < bridge> <cellegenrih> I also heard that it has cracked versions anyway xddd

20:06 < bridge> <Jupstar ‚ú™> I'll defs buy 64+gb next time xd
20:08 < bridge> <teero777> my next setup is gonna be a supercomputer
20:08 < bridge> <melo∆û> in 15+ years?
20:09 < bridge> <teero777> maybe. idk
20:09 < bridge> <teero777> you'll get better tasses then
20:10 < bridge> <teero777> when i have money i will put a bounty on the aip-gores record

20:50 < bridge> <oxyzo.> is that yur cat
20:50 < bridge> <oxyzo.> is that your cat
21:01 < bridge> <inv41idu53rn4m3> so soft ü•∫
21:14 < bridge> <cellegenrih> what a beaut
21:33 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> jupstar gotta download more ram
21:40 < bridge> <oxyzo.> yeah download some ram here https://www.downloadmoreram.com/
21:44 < bridge> <cellegenrih> :troll:
21:50 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> i for the life of it do not understand the new logger
21:50 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> some calls to ``log_info()`` end up in rcon and some only in stdout
21:50 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> without changing the log level config
21:54 < bridge> <kebscs> and log_info with chatresp doesnt log but sends msg to player
21:54 < bridge> <kebscs> confusing
21:56 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> oh yea but im not even using chatresp
21:56 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> just two calls to log_info from the main thread
21:58 < ws-client3> <ChillerDragon> with ``console_output_level -3`` and ``stdout_output_level 0`` one of the log_info calls prints in rcon but not in stdout the other one is only in stdout but not in rcon?
22:03 < bridge> <ryozuki> @learath2 do u think am5 ddr5 boot times can ever be fixed
22:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> what was wrong with the dummy map finishes 3 days ago
22:52 < bridge> <kollpotato> i missed that completely
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> practice allows more people on the team than max team size
22:55 < bridge> <kebscs> and then unpractice wouldnt kick them
23:00 < bridge> <kollpotato> oof
23:01 < bridge> <kollpotato> whose fault was that xd
23:02 < bridge> <kollpotato> i haven't heard about /unpractice before
23:03 < bridge> <kollpotato> is it a new command which caused all this disaster?
23:04 < bridge> <milkeeycat> heinrich knew from the start üò¨

23:05 < bridge> <kollpotato> heinrich was right all along
23:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> im heinrich fan from this moment
23:06 < bridge> <kollpotato> well i always were
23:09 < bridge> <kebscs> didnt know practice exceeded the team size
23:09 < bridge> <kebscs> but there shouldnt be any more bugs
23:10 < bridge> <kebscs> and the glitched ranks should be easy to remove ig, because its just max size maps
23:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Famous last words
