00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> :justatest:
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> cant* lol
00:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> The fact that you figured out how this painInAss layout functions works kinda great 😃👍
00:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> The fact that you figured out how this painInAss layout functions work kinda great 😃👍
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> all good ideas
06:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> nj louis
09:24 <+ChillerDragon> Why is CNetObj_De_ClientInfo still in the 0.7 snap? Is it even used? 
09:24 <+ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut what was tricky in 0.7 about rainbow i never gave it a try how does it work?
09:24 <+ChillerDragon> i thought all the player info was removed from the snap like name, clan and skin info but it still seems to be in the code if i read it correctly
09:27 <+ChillerDragon> but like only for demos? huh
10:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Yep, I think it's how oy got around the fact that netmsgs and snaps aren't synced
10:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> I was wondering why this didn't get implemented sooner tho
10:52 <+ChillerDragon> sos lerato ddnet snaps bamboozle me
10:52 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668937954.png
10:53 <+ChillerDragon> why is there a nullbyte o.O there are no snap types zero are there?
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> i do not support any fancy ddnet uuid thingies yet. But those are at offset 0x4000 arent they? And also shouldnt be sent to 0.7 clients huh?
10:54 <+ChillerDragon> so how do i interpret type 0? :(
10:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> `OFFSET_UUID_TYPE = 0x4000,`
10:55 <+ChillerDragon> yes!
10:55 <+ChillerDragon> but 0 is not greater than 0x4000 is it?
10:56 <+ChillerDragon> why does my 0.7 client get a snap item of type 0 :(
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> It's the offset of the ID it seems
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just look in the server xd
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> Type is always 0 and ID >= OFFSET_UUID_TYPE for UUID snaps
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> ah
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> aaaa
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> its offset ID
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> not offset type
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> aa
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> thanks brota
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> but weird that ddnet servers send those to 0.7 clients
10:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ask learath
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> i did
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> and u answered 
10:57 <+ChillerDragon> :p
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i am learath
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> are you?
10:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> does IRC show someone else?
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> nah i think im good now since roby the smort ass hinted me in the right direction
10:58 <+ChillerDragon> irc says ur name is "jao"
10:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah then all fine
10:59 <+ChillerDragon> which is obv a bug since he is dead
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i bought a 5800x
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think 280€ for it is cheap
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or maybe black friday scammed
11:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> kek
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> wait but @Robyt3 swarfey checks the type here not the id and his stuff works :/ https://gitlab.com/swarfey/teeworlds-client/-/blob/f85fadcfd7f528f28230e6587186510ac18f21dd/lib/snapshot.ts#L125-127
11:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> tbh in the last years in developped to scam xD
11:14 <+ChillerDragon> maybe i confused type and id somewhere lets hope thats the case
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://www.mindfactory.de/product_info.php/AMD-Ryzen-7-5800X-8x-3-80GHz-So-AM4-WOF_1380727.html
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 240€
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> stnks
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> Meh random german web
11:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> I prefer amazon fast shipping
11:15 <+ChillerDragon> hehe
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> I think it might use a different type internally than it send later
11:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Robyt3> There is also `OFFSET_UUID = 1 << 16,`
11:21 <+ChillerDragon> oof
11:22 <+ChillerDragon> hm i get through the half snap now until i reach something invalid haha https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668939729.png
11:24 <+ChillerDragon> looking at that hexdump is somehow fun :)
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> This is for Demo only
11:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> nop
11:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> no
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> F-Client has extended netmsgs too for example
11:36 <+ChillerDragon> but it is sending the i am ddrace thingy isnt it?
11:37 <+ChillerDragon> i guess ddnet servers send it to all clients no matter what since it is compatible. The unknown type would probably be dropped including the provided length of data.
11:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Nop? Is that not how he handled the sync in demos?
11:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <fokkonaut> Ah u mean demos, yes
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> That's not "random german web", it's basically where everyone in Germany has been buying computer parts for the last 20 years
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> random german web for me xD
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he knows that xd
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> he troll
12:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i didnt
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ofc, u mentioned mindfactory before too
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> literally that website is not known here
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lol
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> hardware unboxed even uses mindfactory prices 😄
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> I have lots of good memories as a kid waiting until midnight on a school day to order on mindfactory to get free shipping 😄
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> for their $ per frame
12:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> true xD
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ok then it maybe was learath or someone else, though we talked about it, esp. when u bought ur 6600 xt 😄
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the famous one in spain is https://www.pccomponentes.com/
12:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but i never went to a store as a kid or smth
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> mhh famous but expensive xd
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> we also have other famous hardware resellers, alternate nbb etc.
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but mindfactory is usually the cheapest
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and actually even in the whole EU
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> doi they use african kids or what
12:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they are in hamburg. i guess they can just save money like that
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> whats in hamburg
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> on of the biggest cities for havours in germany
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> harbors*
12:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or harbor?
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> dunno
12:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> xd
12:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> they also have economies of scale I guess. Since they order a lot, they get the parts cheaper
12:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> ah but they are in Wilhelmshaven
12:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but thats also directly at the north sea
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> btw @Ryozuki mindfactory shows an estimate of how many stuff was sold
12:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that's also pretty cool 😄
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1043849473622802472/image.png
12:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> :pepebooming:
12:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> the market share of ryzen must be insane in germany actually looking at these values
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Most people don't build their own computer, most buy laptops, a few buy prebuilt desktops, even fewer build their own computer. Prebuilts have great deals with Intel
12:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> any stats on that? ^^
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dont know many ppl owning a laptop tbh
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> most either have smartphone/tablet or a real computer 😄
12:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but yeah probs most just buy computers at aldi lol xD
12:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Most PCs are probably in companies, they don't build themselves
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> but I don't have statistics
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> that's true
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it also depends on age probs
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> older teachers often have laptops
12:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> and companies like to rebuy every 3-4 years to get tax refunds even if it wouldn't make sense otherwise
12:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and schools buy overpriced hardware that sucks completly xD
12:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> like every school in my region buys terra:
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://www.wortmann.de/
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Are you working with the schools or how do you know?
12:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> no, but my father is a teacher
12:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and well i went to school and uni. and it was always a joke that these stupid terra computers dont work again xd
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and my brother is also getting a teacher. he partial time jobbed to repair/install new OS for schools
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but they are in NRW
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
12:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so i guess it could defs be a regional thing
12:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> tf is that
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <tela> btw @Learath2, I figured out that the F20-F24 thing is a macos problem, nothing to do with ddnet.  For some reason a program I have that shows keyboard events will register the key presses, so I thought the OS could handle them, but no.  Thanks anyway tho
12:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Swarfey> chillerdragon: ddnet only sends type_id=0 id=uuid_type_id if they want to register a new uuid, usually somewhere at the beginning of the connection, after the uuid's are registered they use type_id & id fields normally

15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> The specs are most likely on 5th generation processors with some kind of graphics card power to compensate, most of the time it's fuckin above the respected prizes of those laptops
15:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> At least what the laptop market is targeting users with are 5th generation or above processor laptop
15:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Cellegen | RiH> At least what the laptop market is targeting users with are 5th generation or above processor laptops
16:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> with nvidia optimus, so they are 100% doomed
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> is there any library to work with teeworlds demos
16:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> any language
16:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> c++ -> ddnet/src/
16:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> never heard of any
16:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> oh naaawh i hate working with datafiles 😩
16:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> oh hell naaawh i hate working with datafiles 😩
16:49 <+ChillerDragon> what do you need from the demos?
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> mostly map and data
16:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> i read heinrich's doc and understand everything, i think im capable of doing it myself 🥹
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> is not possible to do operations in script ?
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> like
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> i cant get the value of cl_dummy_resetonswitch
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> either 0 or 1
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> and i cant do something like
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> cl_dummy_resetonswitch ? "Yes" : "No"
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> there is no interpreter in ddnet for such advanced logic
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can execute commands when u click on a key
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> so im fucked and cant know when its on or not
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> i just have to manually check all the time
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> thats e.g. not a problem
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can use smth like echo
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> the command is a toggle
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes, but u can also execute a cfg that rebinds your key u pressed
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> using files to exec commands seems unoptimized
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> 2 files when i can just do toggle
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> is it possible to get the value if i modify the client ?
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> is it like stored in an accessible env
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> through the client
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> dont know the language of the client
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bind ctrl+i "toggle cl_dummy 0 1; echo test"
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> interestingly it only works when u put the toggle at the beginning
17:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> guess our bind converter is also quite limited
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> i cant know if the value is 1 or 0
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> echo just exec all the time
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> cant i just make a custom client and make it possible directly in the client code
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes u can only do it with using files what u dont want
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so could at least made it echo that u clicked it
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> yes but what about the client
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean if u want to improve the logic for binds go ahead
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> or suggest it on github, maybe someone is willing to do it
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but since it already is possible with files its not likely
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> its not possible with files
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> u cant get the value
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> and do boolean if statement or ternary
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> u can bypass and do something not optimized
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> but u cant do anything
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @heinrich5991 how to use your libtw2, im confused 😅

17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ok  nvmi forgor 💀  `::new()`
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ok nvm i forgor 💀  `::new()`
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why u need it, why files u can do
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> echo yes
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> echo no
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> depending on the state of your toggle
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why u need it, with files u can do
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> echo yes
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> echo no
17:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> also dunno what u mean with not optimized, not optimized bcs it uses 40 bytes on your disk or what xdd
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> bc
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> i wish the script handled basic coding stuff
17:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> like
17:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> use the var value and do stuff with it
18:32 <+ChillerDragon> fellow eval if enjoyer
18:32 <+ChillerDragon> @Froggie wat you want is this patch https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3552
18:32 <+ChillerDragon> but u get banned by heinrich for botting if you use it axaxax
18:33 <+ChillerDragon> works in vanilla :p
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> so its a banned feature
18:33 <+ChillerDragon> yes
18:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> then gg
18:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Froggie> wont use it
18:34 <+ChillerDragon> xf
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> use botless ath
19:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> outdated btw
19:58 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> @heinrich5991 how do i interact with demo map 👉 👈

20:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> TypeId is u64
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @uwu do u know rust?
20:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats news  to me :o
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> not rly, made few scripts, but didnt learn it tbh
20:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> im coding with my feelings, not knowledge :kek:
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u dont make scripts in rust
20:19 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u compile programs
20:20 <+ChillerDragon> mimimi ryo
20:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ik ik they just were short and make simple tasks so i called them scripts :nouis:
20:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> ik ik they just were short and made simple tasks so i called them scripts :nouis:
20:23 <+ChillerDragon> no matter what you do if you use a compiled language ryo will never call you skript kiddie axaxaxax
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Ахахах
20:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> 🥸
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> write rust macro that parses bash to rust code automatically
20:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> would be awesome
20:28 <+ChillerDragon> i prefer bash script over rust macro
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but its bash
20:28 <+ChillerDragon> https://github.com/ChillerDragon/bash-to-rust
20:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> lol
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> Im surprised it wasnt created 2 seconds ago
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but dunno
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> 
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> smth like bash!(
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> <bash code>
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> )
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and just compile
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> ah you mean 
20:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> why not bra
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> a
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> ye sounds good
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> i have the same for c++ in bash xd
20:29 <+ChillerDragon> inline cpp
21:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Voxel> @louis gg on your first pr
21:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lmao
22:28 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> gg
22:43 <+ChillerDragon> omg jopstar vulkan shaders completley rape my vps :( https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668980409.png @Jupstar ✪ why does it need like a zillion processes like no chill it freezes the whole vps
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> bcs only way i found to make cmake multithreaded is to spawn a new process
22:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so dunno maybe u can control it over cmake
22:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it just gets all commands at once to execute
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <louis> @Not Keks do u know what tile buffering is
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it buffers tile information on the GPU's VRAM
22:52 <+ChillerDragon> pls not multithread spam on potato hardware with 1 core thnks
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> where did u even find such a bad VPS?
22:55 <+ChillerDragon> digitalocean
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how much do you pay for such bad hardware xd
22:55 <+ChillerDragon> idk
22:55 <+ChillerDragon> around 5 bucks i guess
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> uff
22:55 <+ChillerDragon> -.-
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i mean 1gb ram is rip dude
22:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> at least enable swap
22:56 <+ChillerDragon> no disk space left
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> how do u want to compile without disk space
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> stop lying and just enable swap
23:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> u can also enable it temporarily
23:01 <+ChillerDragon> i just deleted all temp data to not have a vbroken vps with 100% disk usage bro
23:01 <+ChillerDragon> budget dragon is on da limits man
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> then enable file system compression
23:01 <+ChillerDragon> FTX bankrupt fked me
23:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so its even slower xd
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> cryptorekt 😦
23:02 <+ChillerDragon> joke joke i didnt have any moni in FTX 
23:02 <+ChillerDragon> not your keys not your coins
23:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well FTX' collapse destroyed value of crypto in general. I lost hundreds of euros 😦
23:03 <+ChillerDragon> on paper
23:03 <+ChillerDragon> duh
23:03 <+ChillerDragon> or did you realize your losses?
23:03 <+ChillerDragon> da ppl with FTX accounts properly lost money
23:04 <+ChillerDragon> a smol price dip is no loss
23:04 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668981775.png
23:04 <+ChillerDragon> wat
23:05 <+ChillerDragon> idk jopstar they dont gimme pricing only estimated pricing xd
23:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I would never realize losses. I never invest money I can't afford to completely lose. Speculative assets are just gambling, I'm all in until I hit my target. If I get 2x I'm out, else I'll just wait
23:07 <+ChillerDragon> based
23:07 <+ChillerDragon> man jopstar u kinda made me wanna switch to hetzner 
23:07 <+ChillerDragon> but lazy
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I like hetzner, they have cheap servers that aren't completely shit
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Good business
23:08 <+ChillerDragon> xd
23:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> at that same price point kimisufi's service runs on thoughts and prayers
23:09 <+ChillerDragon> kimi wat
23:09 <+ChillerDragon> wot u talkin old man
23:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> ovh's budget line
23:09 <+ChillerDragon> a
23:10 <+ChillerDragon> more than 1 cpu is kinda cool
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> i dunno if your VPS is hosted by someone from teeworlds community its fine too xdd
23:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but the fact that i pay less than half for 2cores and 2gb ram is funny xd
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> wtf
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but prices increased lately :/
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but tbf its not clear what CPU my vcores are
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> send
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> it was a discount on netcup.de
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> permanent
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> ?
23:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yes
23:12 <+ChillerDragon> stonks
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they do such discounts to easter, world cups, christmas etc.
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> and sometimes random
23:13 <+ChillerDragon> i was a netcup customer once back in the days
23:13 <+ChillerDragon> then i rq cuz lags
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> its fine for me. but it doesnt have good ddos protection
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u need that
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> so ddos = rip. else its fine xd
23:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://www.netcup.de/bestellen/produkt.php?produkt=2948
23:13 <+ChillerDragon> for me the else case wasnt fine
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but they relatively cheap
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> but they were cheaper in the past
23:14 <+ChillerDragon> wow thats also still cheaper than hetzner
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> rip
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u find a cheaper they give u 10% on that deal xD
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> just need to contact the support
23:14 <+ChillerDragon> wait what? xd
23:14 <+ChillerDragon> lmao
23:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yeah xD
23:15 <+ChillerDragon> wait so if i find a netcup competitor who is cheaper they offer me the same specs for 10% of the competitors price? xd
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> https://www.netcup-news.de/2022/11/18/fahrplan-fuer-den-black-friday-2022/
23:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> here their black friday discounts
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> "16:00 Uhr : VPS Black Moon NUR 5,79 € / Monat (maximal 222 Stück)"
23:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> could be a good deal
23:19 <+ChillerDragon> seems more expensive than my DO rn
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> yep but maybe it has 4 cores 4gb ram
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> they dont always have the cheap vps discount sadly
23:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> if u have time on that date just look at it, and if u dislike dont buy it 😉
23:22 <+ChillerDragon> guess i gotta be fast to decide
23:22 <+ChillerDragon> due to the limit
23:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> cannot judge tbh
23:23 <+ChillerDragon> and an account i lost mine :c
23:27 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668983105.png
23:27 <+ChillerDragon> bra
23:27 <+ChillerDragon> no paysafecard no crypto only the spy money xd
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> lastschriftverfahren
23:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> german sounds fun
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> I'm looking for a way to get a "dynamic" number on a website using bash & **grep ** command, does anyone have an idea? for example with this page, get the value of the btc
23:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> ||https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/||
23:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> can't figure out how to get this particular "dynamic" number
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> use
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xpath
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> grep for something like `<span class="currency-pricestyles__Price.* </span>`?
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> You should be using their API, the numbers might be loaded using JS
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> tried so, many results
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @deen thats no stopper
23:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://phantomjs.org/
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> On that page I only see one span matching that result
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Something like this: https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> oh true
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most have an api
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> But yes, if you don't HAVE to scrape, don't scrape
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> hmm, this was an example, the real one has like 5 of them
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Especially with markup unaware tools like grep
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i suggest u use tradingview api, they aggregate all exchanges
23:37 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://www.tradingview.com/rest-api-spec/
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://www.tradingview.com/rest-api-spec/#operation/getQuotes>
23:38 <+ChillerDragon> yikes did ddnet drop debian stable support? 
23:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> For a crude tool like grep I'd need to see the exact page you are looking at to find a way to grep for the value you need
23:38 <+ChillerDragon> ``2022-11-20 23:37:44 I assert: /home/chiller/git/DDNetPP/src/engine/server/register.cpp(517): curl version < 7.77.0 does not support registering via both IPv4 and IPv6, set `sv_register ipv6` or `sv_register ipv4`
23:38 <+ChillerDragon> ` 
23:38 <+ChillerDragon> awuhdhawd a irc did newline
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> How is that a dropping support xd
23:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> ddnet is currently built on Debian 10, so that should work
23:40 <+ChillerDragon> well my server gets an assert and thus a crash on launch because curl is too old
23:40 <+ChillerDragon> https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/curl
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you HAVE to scrape but aren't limited to grep, I suggest beautifulsoup and python. The single thing python is good for is writing web scrapers 😄
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Just read what it says
23:40 <+ChillerDragon> ah xd
23:40 <+ChillerDragon> omg
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> TrollerDragon
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> well, here it is : https://www.boursorama.com/bourse/indices/cours/1rPCAC/
23:40 <+ChillerDragon> why is that not an default :c
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> 
23:40 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> there're many spans and grep seems to be fucked up with mutli apostrophe
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> well, here it is : https://www.boursorama.com/bourse/indices/cours/1rPCAC/
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> 
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> there're many spans and grep seems to be fucked up with mutli apostrophes
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Why use outdated distro xd
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Which price on here are you trying to grep? The big one on the left?
23:41 <+ChillerDragon> wot distro u suggest for a vps jopster?
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> this one
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1044019778727182346/image.png
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> uwuntu :gigachad:
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Seems loaded by js, this won't really work easily
23:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Dunno what u use. Latest stable debian
23:45 <+ChillerDragon> i use latest stable debian
23:45 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Oh
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Didn't know Heinrich also has a progressive soul and uses bleeding edge technology xdd
23:46 <+ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668984280.png
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> one of my teachers gave me this as an assignment, i bet he doesn't know himself how to do it :greenthing:
23:46 <+ChillerDragon> u mean this?
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Maybe compile with bundled libs
23:46 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> hmm
23:46 <+ChillerDragon> ``curl -s https://www.boursorama.com/bourse/indices/cours/1rPCAC/ | grep -o "c-instrument c-instrument--last.*" | head -n1 | cut -d'>' -f2 | cut -d'<' -f1``
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh it's not loaded by js after all
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> my curl was messing up 😄
23:47 <+ChillerDragon> ur curl is just too new
23:47 <+ChillerDragon> old curl still does js
23:47 <+ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxD
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> should I call Chillerdragon "daddy" from now on?
23:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Do you even support ipv6 xd
23:47 <+ChillerDragon> when it comes to bash yes im daddy
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bashdad
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> 😄
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> BasherDragon
23:48 <+ChillerDragon> bbut
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I'm starving, but I'm also sleepy
23:48 <+ChillerDragon> is that even what you need?
23:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> do I eat or do I sleep?
23:48 <+ChillerDragon> i asked my self the same earlier
23:48 <+ChillerDragon> i chose neither
23:48 <+ChillerDragon> xd
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> anyway thanks for your help ;D imma try to found out what it does tomorrow!
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Sleeping is quite efficient so u won't starve
23:49 <+ChillerDragon> eating is quite efficient so u won't sleep
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> That would be nice
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> but I might wake up hangry if I sleep this hungy
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> technically the best distro for a vps
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> is nixos
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> reproducible
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can just spun a new vps and put ur nixos config
23:49 <+ChillerDragon> distro hopper enetered the conversation
23:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and replicate
23:50 <+ChillerDragon> cant i use just nix pkg manager on my deb10?
23:50 <+ChillerDragon> and get new curl?
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 🤓
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Just use windows server
23:50 <+ChillerDragon> mic drop
23:50 <+ChillerDragon> even m$ uses linux omg xd
23:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> don't use deb10
23:51 <+ChillerDragon> eh
23:51 <+ChillerDragon> deb11
23:51 <+ChillerDragon> i mean
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> run your server bleeding edge artix
23:51 <+ChillerDragon> u wot
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Crash every 15 minutes
23:51 <+ChillerDragon> xd
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> Free bsd is da real os
23:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar ✪> A good os has a good license
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Oh also, I got whacked in the head so hard with an oculus controller that I think I lost like half my brain cells
23:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it's been almost 7 hours and I still have a headache :ZhongliConcern:
23:53 <+ChillerDragon> @Nouaa oh wait you want something for a teacher? i just red it. Should i explain what my madness of commands do? But if u wanna impress some teacher dont use ugly bash hax use a proper css selector like lerato said beautifulsoup or similar
23:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> well, would be perfect if you could explain your magic :brownbear:
23:57 <+ChillerDragon> well u know grep rite?
23:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Nouaa> not really
23:57 <+ChillerDragon> xd nice
23:57 <+ChillerDragon> it gud to search text
23:57 <+ChillerDragon> so i started by opening the dev tools in ma browser https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668984937.png
23:57 <+ChillerDragon> then i saw the span element with the class
23:58 <+ChillerDragon> i picked the class and checked in vscode that it was the first occurence
23:58 <+ChillerDragon> so i did grep for that said class meaning i was searching the line where the class occurs
23:58 <+ChillerDragon> ``grep -o "c-instrument c-instrument--last.*"``
23:59 <+ChillerDragon> at the end i put a .* to match anything that follows
23:59 <+ChillerDragon> in the beginning i specified the -o flag to only display what matched
