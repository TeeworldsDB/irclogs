00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Well assuming both sides have IEEE754 floats there is no actual issue there, is there?
00:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> nan encoding is unspecified and actually different across architectures, probably need to guard against +inf, -inf, etc.
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> How about we only have IEEE754 floats in the protocol and unpack them into platform floats? On most architectures it'd be a no-op
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> ieee754 floats have unspecified nan patterns for signaling/non-signaling nan ^^
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> afaik
00:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> but I guess we could standardize on intel or something
00:03 <+bridge> [ddnet] <heinrich5991> I think conventional wisdom about floating point is that you should not send it over the network. I guess I'll try to find the article to see whether it applies to us
00:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> This is why we need fixed point arithmetic ðŸ˜¦
00:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> yes, floating point compatibility is perhaps to some extent already assumed in other parts of the code too
00:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <trml> oh, it looks like hook is quantized yes. always assumed it wasn't. so maybe something like that wouldn't have been too bad for projectiles
04:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> how is mouse lock handled? I've been encountering a bug where the mouse fails to lock and there doesn't seem to be a way to relock it. Would be nice if there was a button or some command to force lock

10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> What is mouse lock? Do you mean stuck inputs when you hold hook and open console or switch dummy?
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> (@aodq)
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Or lock to the window?
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> Or lock to cardinal directions with distance hack?
10:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ReiTW> put your mouse away from your desk, easy fix
10:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> lock to window.
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> usually GLFW and SDL just hide the mouse to get same behavior
10:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <aodq> but when you have multi monitors it's annoying when it's not locked
