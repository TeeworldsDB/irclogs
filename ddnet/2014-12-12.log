00:10 < eeeee> "latest" "5.0.2"
00:10 < eeeee> and core ddrace is still 16 players max
00:10 <@deen> he probably means ddnet 5.0.2
00:10 <@deen> should try upgrading to 6.4 I guess
00:11 <@deen> can't remember any problems with many players back then though

00:13 < nuborn> hi
00:13 <@deen> hi nuborn 
00:14 < nuborn> the shotgun bullets, like the ones in the map Spallok, only affect one tee when they explode (the one with lowest clientid)
00:14 < nuborn> is this a bug?
00:14 <@deen> well...
00:14 <@deen> "It's always been like this"
00:14 < xRoThx> lol
00:14 < nuborn> ok :D

00:15 < xRoThx> deen:  Talking with Vali on my server :) Nice guy ^^^^
00:15 <@deen> i did quite some changes to those parts, but very carefully not to break old maps
00:15 <@deen> xRoThx: bad idea, I'd advise to just ignore him constantly
00:15 < xRoThx> Naah
00:15 < xRoThx> You join with another name
00:15 < xRoThx> follow the chat
00:16 <@deen> no, thanks

00:16 <@deen> he's constantly lying/"trolling"
00:18 < xRoThx> Well
00:19 < xRoThx> I want to get him to ddos me as a test. 
00:19 < xRoThx> but need to stay friendly ^^
00:19 <@deen> "you"
00:19 <@deen> would also take down DDNet GER
00:19 < xRoThx> Naah, 
00:19 < xRoThx> He admits he can't handle me :) 
00:19 <@deen> but don't worry, he ddoses your home connection as well
00:19 < xRoThx> you should realy come follow
00:20 <@deen> I'm working
00:20 < xRoThx> and my home connection.. takes me 1min to restart & get another one. Or go mobile internet
00:20 < xRoThx> okay.. 
01:02 < Savander_> good night
01:08 < _guest> hi guys
01:08 < _guest> deen: do you have protection against ddos attacks on your servers?
01:09 < _guest> There is someone from Toronto who ddosed mine everyday since 1 week :(
01:16 <@deen> _guest: yeah, some of our server are more or less ddos protected
01:16 <@deen> USA, CAN, GER, GER2, EUR, RUS
01:18 < _guest> protected by provider?
01:19 <@deen> yeah
01:21 < _guest> so, you dont have more and more attacks since 1 week?
01:42 <@deen> nope, nothing as far as i can see
01:46 < _guest> good for you! What is your provider for GER & EUR ?
01:46 <@deen> you could whois the ips to find that out btw
01:46 <@deen> GER is @ nfoservers, EUR @ OVH
01:46 < _guest> sure. Ok, thx
01:46 < _guest> good night

17:17 <@deen> Hm, there is no way to save a broken demo?
17:20 <@deen> Skipping a packet/chunk or something
17:23 <@deen> http://ddnet.tw/broken.demo if anyone's interested. Need the blmapV5 from r0x.fr to make it load, but stops playing after 1 second
17:57 <@EastByte> deen: what's in the demo?
17:57 <@deen> no idea
17:58 <@EastByte> why do you want to watch it?
17:59 <@deen> Someone else asked me if it's fixable
17:59 <@EastByte> ah
17:59 <@EastByte> I have so many demos which are kind of corrupt
18:00 <@EastByte> mostly because of their size
18:00 <@EastByte> couldn't figure out what causes the crash
18:04 < laxadedi> EastByte: you are too good, computer can't handle that :(
18:05 < laxadedi> joke apart, never had any problem on windows I think. Oh yeah only once, but can't remember which demo, it was making the client crash and deen fixed it iirc
18:05 < laxadedi> well, afk 1 hour
18:07 <@EastByte> well try to record a full tournament and play it :P
18:47 < Savander> maybe it was made on another client,..
18:47 < Savander> (demo)
18:47 <@EastByte> nah, looks corrupt
18:49 < Savander> okay :)
18:50 <@EastByte> deen: while stepping with gdb, mplayer stucks :/
18:54 <@EastByte> seems to be a problem with alsa
20:41 <@EastByte> deen: https://eastbit.net/priv/broken.webm
20:50 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: worksforme
20:50 <@heinrich5991> oh wait, in mplayer
21:40 <@deen> EastByte: how did you fix it?
21:41 <@deen> Ha! GER block server was empty for a whole 3 minutes last night, enough to restart it
21:41 <@EastByte> basically like you said "Skipping a packet/chunk or something"
21:42 <@deen> EastByte: yeah, i tried that as well, can you show me how you did it?
21:42 <@EastByte> there was a corrupted delta snapshot chunk
21:42 <@deen> should probably add that to the client
21:42 <@EastByte> the problem is that the chunk data size was corrupted aswell
21:42 <@deen> so that demo viewer is more robust
21:42 <@deen> yeah, i guessed so =/
21:42 <@EastByte> so I used python to search for snapshot like looking binary strings :P
21:42 <@deen> hm, ok
21:42 <@EastByte> there is one full snapshot per 5 seconds
21:43 <@EastByte> I was able to use the next
21:43 <@deen> Can you send me the final file at least? ChillerDragon will be happy^^
21:43 <@EastByte> I didn't manage to export a new demo file :/
21:43 <@deen> There should be some synchronization in the demo file somewhere
21:43 <@deen> ah, ok
21:43 <@EastByte> but I contacted ChillerDragon and sent him the video
21:43 <@deen> nice
21:45 <@EastByte> will be hard to find out what caused the corruption :/
21:45 <@EastByte> hopefully some hdd failure^^
21:45 <@deen> if the network packet is corrupted, it would not get saved in the demo, right?
21:45 <@deen> so the failure has to happen locally
21:45 <@EastByte> yea
21:46 <@deen> yeah, let's just say it was the hardware. otherwise a cosmic ray
21:46 <@EastByte> and I'm pretty sure that the main reason was a wrong chunksize
21:47 <@EastByte> atleast I learned some new stuff about the demo player
21:47 <@EastByte> maybe I can fix my down demo problems some day^^
21:48 <@EastByte> deen: btw. why is thread sound loading disabled by default?
21:49 <@EastByte> we should improve the startup time of the client
21:49 <@deen> oh, it is?
21:49 <@deen> i guess because i didn't change it?
21:49 <@deen> or did i?
21:50 <@EastByte> MACRO_CONFIG_INT(ClThreadsoundloading, cl_threadsoundloading, 0, 0, 1, CFGFLAG_CLIENT|CFGFLAG_SAVE, "Load sound files threaded")
21:50 <@deen> Maybe it caused problems for some people
21:50 <@EastByte> hmm
21:50 <@deen> need to check git blame
21:50 <@EastByte> and what about threading skin loading?
21:50 <@deen> would be cool
21:50 <@deen> skin loading takes most time of the startup iirc
21:50 <@EastByte> would be a great benefit for the client
21:51 <@deen> I don't know, for me the client starts in 1 second^^
21:51 <@deen> and my computer isn't even fast
21:51 <@deen> you could still do it, just have to be careful that unloaded skins aren't used anywhere yet
21:52 <@deen> or if you don't want, i can try
21:52 <@EastByte> [gameclient]: initialisation finished after 1776.13ms
21:52 <@deen> Commit from 10 months ago: "Disable Threaded Sound loading by default (might crash?)"
21:53 <@deen> ^^
21:53 <@EastByte> huh, mhmm
21:53 <@deen> i think there were some reports of crashes and I told people to disable threaded sound loading
21:53 <@EastByte> someone was too lazy to find the crash^^
21:53 <@deen> and that fixed it
21:54 <@deen> [14-12-12 21:53:21][gameclient]: initialisation finished after 870.41ms
21:54 <@EastByte> okay it's bad if we can't fix thread errors which happen on random machines
21:54 <@deen> EastByte: maybe you have texture compression enabled
21:54 <@EastByte> [14-12-12 21:52:50][gameclient]: initialisation finished after 492.83ms
21:55 <@EastByte> until now I didn't even know what it's for...
21:55 <@deen> but now client needs more memory :P
21:55 <@EastByte> lol I dont care :D
21:55 <@deen> so threading would be ideal
21:55 <@deen> faster + less memory
21:57 <@EastByte> hm something is strange
21:58 <@EastByte> what takes so long while the screen is black (before the loading screen)
21:58 <@EastByte> it feels longer than 500ms
21:58 <@deen> I can't really test right now, my GPU driver is dead, can't run opengl^^
21:59 <@deen> and i don't want to interrupt my work by restarting X
22:01 <@EastByte> ^^
22:06 < Savander> it's weird, I testing new vps in poland, and when I have to install something i got this :http://pastebin.com/i8mDJVft
22:06 < Savander> you know maybe what is it?
22:06 <@deen> apt-get install dialog?
22:07 <@deen> or whiptail
22:07 < Savander> already have dialog
22:08 < Savander> ok i installed whiptail
22:09 < Savander> and now it doesn't show
22:09 < Savander> thanks ;)
23:39 < eeeee> i have some async skin loading in my js demo viewer thing
23:41 < eeeee> and async mapres loading. also because it loads no sounds or fonts (using canvas text rendering), it starts even faster than native client :)
23:52 < Savander> deen: can you send ping to tw.ddforce.net?
23:52 <@deen> twping or udp ping?
23:52 <@deen> ehm
23:52 <@deen> icmp*
23:53 < Savander> idk :< just for test ping 
23:53 <@deen> maybe i should close my VPN before^^
23:53 <@deen> 44 ms
23:53 <@deen> You can compare with my other pings here: http://ddnet.tw/ping/
23:54 < Savander> woah
23:54 <@deen> Wow, first day today where GER didn't lag!
23:54 <@deen> Since forever!
23:54 <@deen> Maybe they finally solved the issue
23:54 < Savander> i testing now
23:54 < Savander> vps in Poland
23:54 <@deen> I wrote a few more letters that got ignored
23:54 < Savander> Warsaw
23:54 <@deen> nice
23:54 < Learath2> never ISPs never solve things
23:54 < Savander> hosteam.p.l
23:54 < Savander> anti ddos
23:54 < Savander> protection on dedi servers
23:54 < Savander> very good protection, all big teamspeak 3
23:54 <@deen> Learath2: yeah, i think so too, but now that I have graphs I spammed them with graphs and traceroutes
23:55 < Savander> host in hosteam
23:55 < Savander> because they have
23:55 < Learath2> :D
23:55 < Savander> anti ddos like OVh or better
23:55 < Learath2> Savander: very good protection is only proven in field
23:55 < Learath2> when you actually get ddoses
23:55 <@deen> Yeah, so far nfoservers is the only ddos protection where we had 0 problems
23:55 <@deen> (at least with the protection)
23:56 < Savander> no
23:56 < Savander> they have a lot of problems with ddos
23:56 <@deen> who?
23:56 < Savander> i guess, more than your servers
23:56 < Learath2> what kind of bandwith are these nfoservers guys putting out for ddos
23:56 < Savander> hosteam
23:56 < Savander> because a lot of teamspeak 3
23:56 < Savander> and ppl are stupid
23:56 <@deen> Learath2: not much actually, their entire datacenter in Frankfurt is connected with 20 gbit/s
23:57 <@deen> Learath2: and they don't advertise their ddos protection anywhere at all
23:57 < Savander> they want more ppl on their server so they ddos others
23:57 < Learath2> well then you prolly dont get ddos anymore
23:57 <@deen> Savander: yeah, tw server hosters too
23:57 < Savander> but, still i think teamspeak 3 is bigger ( in poland veeeerry huge)
23:57 <@deen> Learath2: We always got > 10 gbit/s (don't know how much since then the other server shut down) with the old server
23:57 < Savander> and is a lot of more ddosers.
23:57 <@deen> Learath2: you think they just stopeed when we switched?^^
23:57 < Learath2> or traffic somehow gets filtered somewhere along the way
23:58 <@deen> Learath2: yeah, exactly. They get their connection from internap and they probably have the ddos protection
23:59 <@deen> funnily internap isn't even in Frankfurt, so I'm not sure how this works
