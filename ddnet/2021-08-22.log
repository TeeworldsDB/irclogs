10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found out why it crashes
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i forgot to call EVP_DigestSignInit
10:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> in fact it should have been obvious since i wasnt giving it a private key anywhere xd
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> > D:\a\ddnet\ddnet\src\game\client\components\auth.cpp(2,10): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'openssl/crypto.h': No such file or directory [D:\a\ddnet\ddnet\debug\DDNet.vcxproj]
10:43 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> stupid windows
10:44 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> bestos
10:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Learath2 windows and mac dont link to openssl?
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well they dont find it
10:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> :kek:
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the CI doesnt install it
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what to do about windows
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe some bundle
10:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <attack on ekmek> ðŸ˜ƒ
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah and it is only solution
10:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> or using vcpkg
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://vcpkg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/installing-and-using-packages/
10:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> vcpkg sounds the most modern sane way
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> yeah but its teeworlds
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> so
10:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> lets use some bundles
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> macos cant find it
10:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmm
11:01 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> hmm @Maiski your pr did not fix my issue in case you were aiming for that
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> The thing is we don't require openssl yet, on any platform
11:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkaS:
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> we used to, but we removed the dependency to get security updates from your system's curl version on linux
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> instead of relying on me releasing a new ddnet version with updated openssl quickly
11:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> Done
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> @Ryozuki fwiw I'd probably link to libsodium separately on all platforms
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> why
11:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it all works with openssl rn
11:34 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> because openssl is a mess ðŸ˜›
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> it has the jankiest interface known to man too
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i link to openssl with android
11:35 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> u can steal the build scripts xd
11:36 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @TsFreddie you here?
11:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Maiski> chillerdragon: my fix was unrelated to your issues, since they occur even without resizing
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> yeah but i alreayd figured it out
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> all the key stuff is done
11:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
13:55 < ***> Buffer Playback...
13:55 <+bridge> [13:34:14] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean it doesnt really matter @TsFreddie that whole check is useless
13:55 <+bridge> [13:34:19] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i'll remove it anyway
13:55 <+bridge> [13:34:31] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> sure
13:55 <+bridge> [13:34:38] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we don't need to store any desktop screen values
13:55 <+bridge> [13:34:44] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> @TsFreddie one more
13:55 <+bridge> [13:35:04] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> when resizing
13:55 <+bridge> [13:35:04] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize
13:55 <+bridge> [13:35:06] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> still gives the HDPI even on non HDPI?
13:55 <+bridge> [13:35:24] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> i remember seeing bugs like that
13:55 <+bridge> [13:35:28] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> so probably
13:55 <+bridge> [13:35:38] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yeah, but rn we relie on SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize on resize
13:55 <+bridge> [13:35:42] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> not on GetWindowSize
13:55 <+bridge> [13:35:43] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> yep
13:55 <+bridge> [13:35:51] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so resizing is wrong on macos without HDPI?
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:02] [ddnet] <Learath2> It's fine for me fwiw
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:03] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i can i set the viewport to the hidpi list else
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:11] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/878965770669924382/unknown.png
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:12] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean i set the viewport to the hidpi list else
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:14] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:15] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> i checked it
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:17] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i understand that
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:20] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and it makes sense
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:28] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i mean in CGraphics_Threaded::Resize
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:33] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> then i'm not sure
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:35] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we only fetch the canvas size
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:36] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> it was fine
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:39] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wtf
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:44] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> but i don't know what should be wrong
13:55 <+bridge> [13:36:45] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is so reandom xD
13:55 <+bridge> [13:37:05] [ddnet] <Learath2> fwiw this doesn't happen to me either, I get the correct values
13:55 <+bridge> [13:37:11] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> `m_pBackend->GetViewportSize(m_ScreenWidth, m_ScreenHeight);`
13:55 <+bridge> [13:37:28] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> we use SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize after resize to set the correct viewport
13:55 <+bridge> [13:37:31] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> makes sense on HIDPI
13:55 <+bridge> [13:37:42] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but if it always reports HIDPI, it should break non HIDPI
13:55 <+bridge> [13:37:50] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> probably some SDL version thing
13:55 <+bridge> [13:38:01] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> my mac is weird
13:55 <+bridge> [13:39:27] [ddnet] <Learath2> all macs are all weird
13:55 <+bridge> [13:39:37] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> ~~can we sue apple~~
13:55 <+bridge> [13:40:22] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> anyway, if somebody with mac could test this, imo its a bug in SDL anway
13:55 <+bridge> [13:40:22] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> a call to SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize should always give the dev the drawable size, and if HIDPI is not desired, then it should not give high values xD
13:55 <+bridge> [13:40:23] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> i just remember i was doing a whole lot of mind twisters while making that PR, i don't think i want to rethink all of that again tbh
13:55 <+bridge> [13:40:34] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
13:55 <+bridge> [13:40:45] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> and it doesn't make any sense anyway
13:55 <+bridge> [13:40:46] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then i'll just assume to work with HiDPI XD
13:55 <+bridge> [13:40:53] [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and hope SDL fixes their stuff some day
13:55 <+bridge> [13:41:26] [ddnet] <Tsæ‡’æ•£> @Learath2 tweet Ryan
13:55 <+bridge> [13:41:38] [ddnet] <Learath2> Just do it the way that is correct and we can fix mac weirdness afterwards
13:55 <+bridge> [13:42:36] [ddnet] <chillerdragon> someone here who wants to test mi ddrace map?
13:55 <+bridge> [13:44:46] [ddnet] <chillerdragon> when bridge #general?
13:55 <+bridge> [13:44:59] [ddnet] <gerdoe> someone should say him
13:55 < ***> Playback Complete.
15:06 <+ChillerDragon> if there is a wall directly behind a blue from tele it still takes the speed when entering sometimes :( is this some feature that is already used in maps or is it just too annoying to fix?
15:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragon: can you read other channels btw?
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> else
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> chillerdragon: i tried to fix this blackscreen thing, i get this on the old intel laptop too
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but even if i set the fullscreen mode to the one reported by SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode it doesn't work
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> So maybe its really a driver thing, especially bcs it works on AMD without any problem
15:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> so rip to real fullscreen users with that problem xd
15:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> onyl developer and wiki \:/ i wish more channesÃ¶l were bridged
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> @Jupstar âœª\: i mean there is the env var and downgrade option
15:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> i currently play with downgraded SDL
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i did it :monkalaugh:
16:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/879009660890394634/unknown.png
16:38 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> nice do you already want to implement accounts or just the protocol?
17:04 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> define implement accounts
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> rn im making the client be able to generate a key pair and register
17:05 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> this is done without interacting with any game server
17:06 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> next i think we need a new protocol msg that the client sends to the gameserver, it should contain the public key, and a signed message using that pubkey with some updated info, maybe the current time
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so the server can use it to ask the auth server to verify its real
17:07 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> hmhm
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/discussions/4033#discussioncomment-1184498>
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhhh
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "The login protocol should bind to the cryptographic session so that the login sequence cannot be forwarded to other servers."
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk if what i said works xd
17:08 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but basically the foundation for this comment is "done"
17:09 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i just need to figure out how to make this session
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> " The account server will store a constant, never changing mapping of public key hash "
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why even account server
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> just use the signature
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> also about the whole multi private keys, for what?
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> because u can lose ur keypair
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why i think u should be able to change the pubkey with the email
17:10 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so a account id mapping is needed
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i am not against a ddnet hosted login accounts additionally
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> "This mapping is public and can be queried via an HTTPS endpoint so third party servers can also use it"
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> this is
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> why not just store the private key on ddnet side
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and then always query it and never save it to disk
17:11 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ???
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> then it cannot be stolen easily
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and ppl that don't want accounts on ddnet have to mantain their keys themself
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> basically 2 account systems
17:12 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 1 that works with private keys like you do
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk what u are talking about
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and a traditional one that is basically one ddnet and is just there for ddnet stuff + the keys for ppl that can't handle all this stuff anyway
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ok
17:13 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the client automatically generates a keypair, and u register to the authserver with a email, this way u wont ever need a password
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Open client
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - either have private key on disk(unsecure for nobos that would just share it)
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> - have it on ddnet account(which is an additional account), always load it from there and only on memory
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and other server don't need to fetch anything from ddnet
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they havve the signature from the public key
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> @Jupstar âœª i dont like having it on "ddnet account"
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i also think its not as secure
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> > the client automatically generates a keypair, and u register to the authserver with a email, this way u wont ever need a password
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Is the authserver configurable? Or is it i. e. auth.ddnet.tw?
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we could avoid nobos sharing it by saving it
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> on another location
17:14 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> than .teeworlds
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i bet they won't loose, they will share it
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ?
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if they want to then let em be
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i ask nobo that has problems with his client to send me his data
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most people wont even know it exists
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he'll will do bcs he 13
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats the problem saving it
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> dude
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> u can ask any kid
17:15 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> send me ur browser cookies
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and historyu
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats just a dumb argument
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> omg
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> mhh i disagree
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> thats something else
17:16 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it should be ye
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the thing is, the client and server
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> need to use the same authserver
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> imho the authserver wouldnt save  any ddnet related data it just has the mapping to the account id
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> then u can manage that account id on ur db with ur own data
17:17 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats how i see it
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Servers can send a special message with the authserver information
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i guess
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> anyways this needs lot of discussion
17:18 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and most important ppl here are afk nowadays so
17:20 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i dunno if there is an auth server anyway you can also just login with username password
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> I would use /login username password as fallback for non-ddnet clients
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> For KoG we've planned to do so
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Integrate the new ddnet login & use the /login username password scheme
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> 7login Ryozuki prorustprogrammer
17:21 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ups
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> But auto-login is a more elegant user flow
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and more secure
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Depends on what you're using, in terms of pub/priv key it is
17:22 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i have to figure out how to make the server know a user is who says it is: basically create a session
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the user has a priv pub key, the authserver has the pubkey mapping
17:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how to make server verify
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> afaik the only way to know a pubkey is from someone is to sign something with a privkey and verify it with a pubkey
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> The client downloads the auth-server public key & signs a message?
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so the client shoudl send some signed message
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that the server can verify by sending it to authserver
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> no the client signs a message with its private key
17:24 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and u can verify that signature is valid with the client pubkey
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the authserver knows the client pubkey
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Is it possible to turn the flow around?
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well knows means it has the mapping to its account id
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> So the server doenst store any keys
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> it has to store the public key
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> the public key is always safe to share
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Yeah, but how do you protect against attacks which aims to send you thousands of public keys
17:25 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> random generated ones
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well thats just spam protection
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats the same as trying to register to a website a lot of times
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Captcha xd
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think thats out of scope for now
17:26 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> we should first have smth working and then consider the spam issues
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> also the auth server is a http server
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so it can be behind cloudflare
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> https://github.com/edg-l/ddnet-authservice
17:27 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> here is my POC authserver
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Mhmm we dont use emails xd
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> its basically to allow recover
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> iirc
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> so u can change ur pubkey
17:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> if u lose ur keypair
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Sure, but we dont use them actually
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> we're using keycloak for the new authorization & authentication system
17:30 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> & discord as primary login provider
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> For the others we allow e-mail/password registrations, but we do not recommend
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i for sure dont want to depend on discord
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> discord will die in 5 years
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> or less
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Its okay ðŸ™‚ You can integrate Github, Twitter, Guilded.gg & others also
17:31 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah i prefer having it ourselves
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> depending on others sucks
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> oauth2 services
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> Exactly
17:32 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> In your POC, you can add some possibility to set an accountId instead of an email
17:33 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> So you dont have to use the email & can rely on other 3rd party services for user management
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> Still not really convinced by this kind of auth server, where is learath xd
17:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> wasnt he for a semi managed key pair before, or did he change his opinion xd
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> idk xd
17:49 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> everyone is missing
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but actually this is from their comment
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> maybe i interpreted it wrong
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> i think you overestimate ppl xD
17:50 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> wdym
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> "Design as @Learath2 and I talked about:"
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ups
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> that auto ping
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> everyone once loged in in his live
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> username
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> password
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but they never cared about how to be manage data, that might be important
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> .e.g deleting windows, changing os whatever, and all need to recover their keys
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> everyone once loged in in his live
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> username
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> password

17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but they never cared about how to manage data, that might be important
17:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> .e.g deleting windows, changing os whatever, and all need to recover their keys
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye ppl are stupid
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but this is a game
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> they wont lose their lives
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Hm, I don't remember the exact specifics we decided on, but a pubkey associated with an email is what we ended up on
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and ppl who care enough will take care
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> If you have access to your email, you can always add a new pubkey
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats the current status, pubkey with email
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> yes no doubt about that
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> <https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/discussions/4033#discussioncomment-1184498>
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> but i think that happens quite often, more often than loosing their password probably
17:52 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and they dont know why
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> especially users from steam just expect to auto login
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> bcs of >steam<
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ppl dont change os quite often
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> only linux ppl do
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> they reinstall windows once per year xD
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> do they_? xd
17:53 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> most ppl dont know
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> how to install windows
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> dude who doesnt, you have to xD
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> trust me
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> windows after 1 year broken af xd
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> my father pc had windows 8
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> since long
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he didnt want to touch anything
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> cuz scared something breaks
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> ye
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> ye windows gets rly messy
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> from xp to 10 my family did that ritual xd
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> thats why linux is so superior
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i still havent reinstalled arch linux
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <gerdoe> bcs it updates every minute xddd
17:54 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> atleast since 2018
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> nah but windows gets slow not cuz updates
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well maybe
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i found out that windows takes so much space
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and i cant never figure out why
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> and my linux distro still has plenty of space, and i know how to cleanup
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> well we went offtopic
17:55 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> i think we should discuss this account stuff when heinrich is around
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is the one who probs know most
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> and deen xd
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> but deen doesnt seem to discuss accounts
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:56 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> he just lets it flow
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> he is busy making a super in memory database with 128 cores
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> :monkalaugh:
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> xd

17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> look it
17:57 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Ryozuki> xd
17:59 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> 10 million lines of C++ code and 15 million lines of Python tests
18:00 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> We can do auto login with pubkeys np
18:47 <+bridge> [ddnet] <chillerdragon> lmao https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/p93vw3/getting_gplv2_compliance_from_a_chinese_company/
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> you already have steam_api.dll
19:02 <+bridge> [ddnet] <ZombieToad> just use steam authentication
20:39 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Avolicious> But not everyone is using steam, so you can use it partly, but not always
20:48 <+bridge> [ddnet] <uwu> imagine using steam
22:23 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> Q: How would you diagnose a randomly happening couple second packet loss?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> I think this pretty much implies the local connection has an issue, right?
22:29 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/879099901412253746/unknown.png
22:51 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Jupstar âœª> ah nice, perfect moment to debug the bug in #bugs with that packet loss xd
23:41 <+bridge> [ddnet] <deen> @Learath2 turn off every electric device in the house and see if it disappears?
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> hm house too big for that, too many people here
23:42 <+bridge> [ddnet] <Learath2> maybe when my parents are at work I can give it a try
