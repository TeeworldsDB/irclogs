01:47 < bridge_> <Ewan> ?
11:36 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> 2 more and we hit #8303 
11:39 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> xdd
11:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> make an issue "change server port to 8304"
11:50 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> lmao
11:51 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Genius idea actually. Then you can run a ddnet server and a teeworlds server at the same time on their default ports.
12:43 < bridge> <meloÆž> Chilleeeeer
12:43 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
12:43 < bridge> <meloÆž> how can i run the ddnet CI locally?
13:12 < bridge> <robyt3> I wouldn't show the wrong filenames in the list, then you'd need extra memory to store the longer filenames. If it should be more obvious, we could emit a warning popup for every skin that failed to load.
13:13 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> what extra memory. you mean that the invalid skins are loaded?
13:14 < bridge> <robyt3> I mean we currently use `m_aName[24]` for skins names, so if you want to even show the longer names you'd need to increase the size or use `std::string`
13:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> mh right that's how the ddnet client is doing it
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i changed the skin container for dd-pg like this:
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - potentially loadable skins are in a "index"-list, this _can_ include skins that are downloaded over http
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - skins are always lazy loaded, since the list knows all names it automatically triggers the loading of the skin
13:16 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> - skins are unloaded if unused for a certain amount of time
13:19 < bridge> <robyt3> Lazy skin loading is also on my list, but then I decided to first rewrite the image loader so it's usable for that, that should be ready soon. Right now the `downloadedskins` folder is write-only, we always download the skins from the internet again even if the skin already exists in the folder. My idea would be to load the skin from the local storage first and at the same time download the skin again and only write it to the storage and reload it i
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ah yeah that was the part i thought about the most.
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> dd-pg will require http resources to have an index.
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Actually when i implemented the skin database i already thought about the same:
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://skins.ddnet.org/skin/skins.json
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> 
13:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> Sadly i forgot to include file hashes. Additionally i'd change that the json is per dir, so community etc. have their own index.
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that way you only need to download the json and never the real file, as long as the file + hash exist locally
13:22 < bridge> <robyt3> Even better would be if there was a downloadable skin index json which contained the hashes of the current skin files, so downloading the entire skin would be unnecessary to check if it's unchanged
13:22 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> ðŸ˜‰
15:54 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> @meloÆž which part of the CI? I just copy pasted the parts I need from the workflows into a shell script and run that https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/tree/master/.github/workflows
16:01 < bridge> <meloÆž> i see - just want to see if CI is happy before doing a PR and having to fix it lol ty
16:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> The ci runs on git push btw
16:03 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> pr or not
16:04 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> but yea i usually run just ``./scripts/fix_style.py`` before commit. And if I am extra motivated i run my script that runs like 90% of the CI tests but it takes a long time.
16:05 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Is there some start using actions button for you here? https://github.com/BlaiZephyr/ddnet/actions
16:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> Then before you open the pr with ddnet you can check if the pipeline passes in your fork https://github.com/BlaiZephyr/ddnet/tree/add-team0-indicator
16:06 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> If your pr is already open just force push and test on github.
16:07 < bridge> <meloÆž> there was indeed, no workflow running currently, let me try it out
16:08 < bridge> <meloÆž> lol it works - how did i miss that - thanks
16:09 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> <:poggers2:1008007455936094328>
16:09 < bridge> <meloÆž> all hail --allow-empty fr
16:09 < bridge> <meloÆž> me omw to force push 920 commits up teeworlds-community
16:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> you also see it here btw https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/8293
16:10 < ws-client> <ChillerDragon> CI everywhere
16:10 < bridge> <meloÆž> :justatest:
16:10 < bridge> <meloÆž> XD
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> u seriously code without code formatter?
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> that's savage
16:21 < bridge> <meloÆž> you code with a code formatter?
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i often write so much stuff in one line
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> then press save
16:21 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> and it formats epycally
16:22 < bridge> <meloÆž> i format it on the spot simply because thats how i organize my code
16:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> ye my ide has no formatter i never bothered to set one up since ./scripts/fix\_style.py works good enough
16:23 < bridge> <meloÆž> "works good enough" - chiller on his way to open 3 PR's about style
16:23 < bridge> <meloÆž> :justatest:
16:23 < bridge> <chillerdragon> but yes i also often write really sloppy code because i know the format script will carry my ass
16:23 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/293493549758939136/1236322356633534464/epyc.mp4?ex=6637966b&is=663644eb&hm=df9ea9c02b132cbb44349c04e7829488ee422c1930d9c634578f952cb1a986ce&

16:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I highly recommend to try WSL
16:40 < bridge> <meloÆž> your coding video was you doxxing yourself for 40 seconds smh
16:40 < bridge> <chillerdragon> its actually good
16:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> true
16:40 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> @chillerdragon give real video
16:40 < bridge> <meloÆž> coding client-side on wsl2 is something that i couldnt figure out correctly
16:41 < bridge> <meloÆž> aswell as registering an actual ddnet server, because networking and stuff
16:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> real?
16:41 < bridge> <chillerdragon> it was real
16:42 < bridge> <chillerdragon> you want more or wat?

20:11 < bridge> <meloÆž> 
20:11 < bridge> <meloÆž> (while i got you here anyway)
20:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> i can tell you the fix
20:14 < bridge> <Jupstar âœª> update the ci to ubuntu 22
20:14 < bridge> <meloÆž> i... - fair.

20:21 < bridge> <zhn> there's some regex after the executing, try "-m([^\r\n]+)" as suggested in https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=73502
20:22 < bridge> <zhn> (i can't read regex though xd)
20:22 < bridge> <zhn> ig it just removes all the \r and \n it sees
