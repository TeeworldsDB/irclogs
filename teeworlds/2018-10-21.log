09:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> o.O ssh-chat never heard about that
10:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> sounds like something where you ssh to and can then chat
13:09 < breton> who runs master servers?
13:10 < minus> x86 processors
13:10 < breton> that's "what"
13:11 < minus> hm
13:11 < minus> various people
13:11 < breton> can i help them run it? by running my master server, for example?
13:12 < minus> currently 4 of 4 are allocated
14:50 < Dune> heinrich5991:  LordSk asked what there is to do, if there's a clear roadmap anywhere etc
14:51 < Dune> also does github have all the bugs?
14:58 < Dune> feels like a big reason why stuff gets stalled
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah not having a roadmap makes things so confusional
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I believe, for the beginning, the first thing is to fix the main bugs that appeared upon releasing 0.7
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> a lot of stuff wasnt even tested or checked if it's actually working
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I don't believe github has all of them, but most for sure
15:07 < Dune> :/
15:08 < Dune> yeah, it would be nice to have some nice clear roadmap in parallel to fixing 0.7 bugs
15:08 < Dune> hopefully the 0.7.1 release can be cleaner, and have downloads and a changelist (!)
15:09 < Dune> but who should do such roadmaps? I guess Oy is the only one that can do that?
15:09 < Dune> would be nice to have some sort of leader that isn't the guru, idk
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> he seems pretty active in the intern section of the forum
15:10 < Dune> Oy?
15:10 < Dune> hm, I guess
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> that's what i saw at least in the past days (talking about the Bugs forum)
15:10 < Dune> yeah
15:10 < Dune> so I guess we should submit requests for roadmaps and the like there
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> we could try to discuss something there
15:11 < Dune> yeah
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i'd provide the missing macos build firstly and update the downloads page
15:12 < Dune> and the steam pages/screenshots...
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Then bugs will appear in no time ðŸ˜„
15:13 < Dune> but I don't know, isn't 0.7.1 close? Isn't it better to do that as 0.7.1 is released, so the general public doesn't try the bugged version?
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I have no idea
15:13 < Dune> and just consider 0.7.0 as some sort of public beta
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> there are still things to fix i believe
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> and many more to be discovered for sure
15:14 < Dune> would be nice if the most important discovered bugs to fix were fixed *before* the release so that the general public tests something less ostensibly buggy maybe
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i wouldnt release the next version with half bugs remaining
15:14 < Dune> hmm
15:15 < Dune> would have been nice if we had a concept of public beta maybe
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> training.reitw.eu:8303
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> added some stuff
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah ðŸ˜„
15:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> consider that even the UI is far from complete
15:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> it's what sushi left i think
15:17 < Dune> yeah, right
15:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> even the scoreboard should be different
15:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> based on their (sushi,zatline) concept
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://zatline.carbonmade.com/projects/5691196
15:20 < Dune> huh
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i mean it could be worse ðŸ˜„
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> it doesnt look that bad
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> but i would have kept the sidebar for server info etc in the serverbrowser
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> for example
15:21 < Dune> right
15:22 < Dune> i think I was in charge of the settings menu back then but gave up
15:22 < Dune> can't remember of much
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> what happened
15:23 < Dune> eh, I had a deadline to do things before christmas of whatever year, but didn't make it
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> ðŸ˜„
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1530
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> there is this bug
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> dunno what caused it
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Sonix dont talk, do hammerfly with me :<
15:31 < Dune> :/
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> it makes certain things flashier
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> for example damage stars
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> before they expire
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> or emoticons
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in general: transparency is now "replaced" with getting white xd
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah probably
15:34 < Dune> should probably restrain from posting in internal section as i'm no dev
15:34 < Dune> yeah i wonder what caused this fokkonaut
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> why not dune
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> do so
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yep
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> too
15:42 < Dune> what's this bridge btw?
15:42 < Dune> where's the other channel
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> discord
15:43 < Dune> is there an invite link somewhere?
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> sure
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://discord.gg/PhdMcG
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> to write in #bridge you need the Two-Way role (ask heinrich)
15:47 < Dune> thanks for the info fokkonauit
15:47 < Dune> heinrich5991: ^
15:47 < Dune> maybe this could even be the topic here?
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> np
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> did you see my weird things and bugs list  on github? xd
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its could be much longer
15:55 < Dune> yeah
15:55 < Dune> I was thinking about posting a transcript of IRC but I saw you already did
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 0.7 is just not ready
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> there shouldve been a beta testing phase or stuff
15:57 < Dune> well no, but I just take it as a beta
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ye, as there is no official Download button on the site
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> just GitHub
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/503597307288223747/Bildschirmfoto_2018-10-21_um_17.55.00.png
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hue? is it me bein stupid or did matricks dissapear?
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/graphs/contributors
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> didnt he do the majority of contributions?
18:02 < Dune> ChillerDragon: people can change name on github
18:03 < Dune> maybe that's it?
18:03 < Dune> ah, nevermind, it's not, https://github.com/matricks
18:04 < Dune> ChillerDragon: https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds/graphs/contributors
18:04 < Dune> strangely enough he's not on his own teeworlds repo
18:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes i realized that aswell
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> first i thought Oy created the teeworlds/teeworlds and didnt fork but it seems like matricks somehow deleted his tw contributions i vistited his account and had a look at his activity back to 2007 and didnt find tw
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i wonder how the code still be there
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> this reminds me of this linux stuff going on where devs are talking about removing their code cuz they dislike the new code of conduct
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i mean u can still find him in ``git blame``
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds/commit/563f1d0c52283c2718cedd16cf4002353a7e661f
18:13 < Dune> strange
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> u cant click the name.. hue?
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Maybe unlinked the github account idk.
18:14 < Dune> how can he unlik the github account from his own repo
18:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> idk
18:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but u get this unclickable username in commits and invicible in contributions if u commited without having an github account
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <getkey> He removed the mail address he committed with from the verified email addresses in the settings section of his GitHub account
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <getkey> Thus, GitHub doesn't know that the email corresponds to him and can't associate it
19:17 < Dune> huh, I see
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but why
