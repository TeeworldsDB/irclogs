19:09 < Teectac> hey
19:10 < Teectac> what's your thoughts on a public recording of vanilla endgame scoreboards ?
19:13 < laxa> What would be the use ?
19:15 <@heinrich5991> matricks: btw, are you still playing hon? :)
19:17 < Teectac> laxa: just a public display, for posterity, fame or whatever
19:18 < laxa> Well my thoughts: useless, public games are trash, you have really nothing interesting...
19:18 < laxa> And how would ou parse the records ?
19:18 < laxa> spamming servers ?
19:19 < Teectac> modding
19:19 < laxa> Modding ?
19:19 < laxa> Well then your sentence doesn't mean anything
19:19 < laxa> You'll only provide those stats for YOUR server
19:19 < laxa> I understand you'd do that for every vanilla server
19:20 < Teectac> sry for the misunderstanding
19:20 < laxa> and if you provide stats for your servers, then you'd better ask your player base than on this channel also
19:21 < Teectac> lol, i have none
19:22 < laxa> Well, then I don't understand
19:23 < laxa> modding what ? Your servers ?
19:24 < Teectac> teeworlds vanilla
19:25 < laxa> so people would use your mod
19:25 < laxa> Not sure if anyone would be interested
19:26 <@matricks> heinrich5991: no :/
19:26 <@heinrich5991> laxa: people liked playing on stats-saved servers though
19:27 < laxa> Why no one modded that yet then ?
19:27 < Teectac> that's why i'm asking here, would anyone be interested in playing on a server whose scoreboards are displayed publicly on a website
19:27 < laxa> Outputting end scoreboard to just basic file isn't a lots of development
19:28 <@heinrich5991> laxa: because 0.6 stops displaying the score after 999 I think
19:28 < laxa> You never go to 999 in vanilla do you ?
19:28 <@heinrich5991> that was the answer to "why no one modded that yet?" in response to "people liked playing on stats-saved servers though"
