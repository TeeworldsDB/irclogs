09:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I love this game and i want to update to 0.7 when i am back at home but if the chat will look like that i am forced to stay in 0.6 because I am too nobo to modify it my self.

09:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Teeworlds always looked perfect but this chat is a mess and the colors look so bad ._. The old chat was fine and the shadow upgrade is good. But the other stuff -.-
09:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> You can directly talk about it with @LordSk LordSk :)
09:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Maybe the chat background is a bit too strong
