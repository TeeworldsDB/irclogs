10:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> isnt kubuntu a fork of ubuntu and thus just simple debian more or less?
10:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune can the game even launch with a wrong SDL version? Shouldnt it crash?
10:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It's still SDL2, just an older version? @ChillerDragon
10:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so if you have the correct major installed you can have a wrong minor version?
10:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I guess?
10:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> idk xd
10:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> might be
10:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ya minors are somehow comatible huh?
10:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't see anything else to attempt to fix his issue
10:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> install kbuntu :p
10:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I doubt I will be able to reproduce
10:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> create 0.7 fork with sdl1 and ask him to retest kek
13:42 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon: kubuntu is ubuntu but it uses kde instead of gnome
13:43 < Ryozuki> no distro ships with sdl2 by default btw
13:43 < Ryozuki> atleast debian based ones, you have to install it with apt install libsdl2-dev
13:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> do u need the dev version to launch a compiled binary?
13:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i thought u need it to compile source
13:47 < Ryozuki> nah u dont
13:47 < Ryozuki> but its easier for me to remember libsdl2-dev than sdl2-numbers here
13:47 < Ryozuki> and its not like it takes lot of space
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Assa what straw poll? been away for a week
20:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> tw forum.
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Assa answered your strawpoll
22:53 < minus> got account deletion request :o
22:53 < minus> fwiw it's not the first one
22:53 <@heinrich5991> gdpr? :P
22:54 < minus> GDPR wasn't mentioned in either
22:54 < minus> but it does fall under that
22:54 <@heinrich5991> yup
22:54 < minus> even if it wasn't a thing i'd honor deletion requests though
22:57 <@heinrich5991> yes. gdpr basically says: be reasonable ;)
