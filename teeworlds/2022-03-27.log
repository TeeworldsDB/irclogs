12:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune is that PR to big to review? If so I can try to split it up into at least two parts for the material layer and the custom layer. Most of the code is editor-code anyways (which could be a separate PR, too). I am more interested in suggestions on how to handle new game layers (in a somewhat managable and hopefully to other maps/mods handable) ways
12:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Essigautomat I already spend part of my weekend reviewing PRs for work. As long as that's what I do in office, I don't want to do it on my free time. Also, I have @Stiopa's to test before that
12:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> okay no worries ^^ For me it's quite the opposite, I only have time to do stuff for teeworlds in my free time. I am asking, because you (devs) often release new teeworlds versions at eastern or christmas could be a nice present üéÅ
12:58 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> * and this
13:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Isn't this compatibility breaking?
13:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> except for prediction errors, no!
13:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> and that prediction errors only come from new materials with new tuning values, which could even be avoided with some trickery in sending tuning values
