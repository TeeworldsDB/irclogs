15:54 < EastByte> malware distribution
15:55 <@matricks> heh, I've always said that the mod-situation is freakin dangerous
15:56 <@matricks> pushing around binaries here and there
15:59 <@minus> i've taken the thread offline
16:02 < EastByte> there are lots of scriptkiddies in the tw community
16:03 <@matricks> regards for trailer music: http://teetow.com/music/teeworlds/tw_frenzy.mp3
16:03 <@matricks> old old song teetow did
16:03 < EastByte> clearly the same melody :D
16:04 <@matricks> there is actually music for another game as well called teepop :)
16:04 <@matricks> http://teetow.com/music/teepop/Tee,%20have%20mercy!.mp3
16:04 <@matricks> puzzle game so the song goes through a couple of differnet stages in the game
16:05 <@matricks> the music in that game switched tempo depending on how screwed you were
16:06 <@matricks> tempo == style
16:23 < jxsl13> lol, wouldnt mind that music as lounge music option
16:23 < jxsl13> it's cool :D
16:37 < Sadale> Is there any teeworlds map database that can find maps of specific mod?
16:42 < jxsl13> ask heinrich5991 
16:42 < Sadale> oh heinrich5991 is in this room. :o
16:44 < Sadale> heinrich5991, I'm looking for as much [N]Race maps as possible. Now I have completely ported [N]Race to 0.6.x. But the problem is that there are way too many maps flowing around teeworlds and it's very difficult to tell which one is for nrace and which one isn't. I wonder whether you have a list of [n]race map. Thanks!
16:46 < Sadale> heinrich5991, BTW, I'm leaving soon. I've pm'd you my email. In case I'm offline, please send me an email. Any response(regardless of usefulness) will be appreciated.
16:52 < jxsl13> you would have to look for it yourself, I bet he will only give you a link to his database, which I forgot
16:52 < jxsl13> maybe heinrich5991.de
16:52 < jxsl13> http://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/
16:52 < jxsl13> check it out, Sadale 
16:53 < Sadale> jxsl13, actually, I have that link.
16:53 < jxsl13> oh
16:53 < Sadale> jxsl13, hmm. maybe I can filter maps out by the modification date. IDK. Worth a try anyway.
16:53 < Sadale> jxsl13, oh. thanks anyway :)
16:53 < jxsl13> np :D
16:54 < Sadale> jxsl13, BTW, my sister got >5000 maps. I've just made a copy of it :p
16:54 < jxsl13> Oo
16:54 < EastByte> reproducing gamemode from mapfile might be possible by analysing the gamelayer
16:58 < Sadale> EastByte, FYI: I've got the source code of a mod that's based on [N]Race :p
16:58 < Sadale> That's how I reproduced that mod. It's mostly just tedious copy and paste and modify.
16:59 < Sadale> I guess I'll post the mod to the forum soon.
17:07 < Sadale> Is there any command line tool to render teeworlds map file to an image file?
17:11 < Sadale> crap. 17000+ maps in the database. It
17:11 < Sadale> It would take lot of work to filter the [N]Race maps manually :/
17:11 < Sadale> Anyway, gotta sleep :p
17:16 < jxsl13> there is, but you are already gone
17:16 < jxsl13> q.q
17:27 < Neox> hello
17:28 < Neox> Any forum moderator here ?
17:30 < Neox> of course not
17:30 <@minus> of course
17:51 < jxsl13> haters :D
17:51 < jxsl13> xD
18:02 < WolfAlex> minus: do dm,ctf,tdm servers have to be NOT modified at all?
18:03 < jxsl13> I'd prefer the gameplay not being modified at all
18:06 < Neox> WolfAlex : yes
18:06 < Neox> not at all
18:07 < WolfAlex> so if a bug gets discoverd, the hosts would have to wait until a fix comes from teeworlds.com? 
18:08 < jxsl13> or if the console in rcon is not neat at all :D?
18:10 < jxsl13> man, this channel is so slow ._.
