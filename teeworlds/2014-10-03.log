13:37 < d_t> hello. is there an option, that i can use the "teeworlds" swap function for char[16]'s? it doesnt works well.
13:37 <@matricks> huh?
13:38 < d_t> you know the template function "swap", arent you?
13:38 <@matricks> ahh, too swap two values
13:38 <@matricks> yeah, that doesn't work with char[16]
13:39 < d_t> and why? ._.
13:39 <@matricks> because char[16] is an array
13:39 <@matricks> could change the implementation of swap to make it able todo it
13:39 < d_t> can you tell me how?:]
13:40 <@matricks> I won't teach you c++ :/ but use memcpy instead of operator=
13:47 < d_t> yea, i made it work with a new function called swap_char... its not very clean i think but i works.
13:56 < heinrich5991> because c++ is inconsistent there
13:58 < laxa_work> heinrich5991: he left :p
17:17 < o_be_one> test
17:18 < o_be_one> fail >.<
17:19 <@minus> that's a good idea. make a game where you shoot unit tests and call it testwars
17:19 <@minus> pew pew
17:43 < o_be_one> lol minus nice :D
