02:10 < eeeee> maybe we can alter the rules to relax the "only human players are counted" requirement for servers with a specific gametype (e.g. BOT)?
08:52 <+rand> for modded server, you can reasonably alter the number of player reported to the client in order to respect this rule
14:59 < daey> what is the purpose of these bot servers anyways?
15:02 <+rand> i can only speak for mine, it's PoC, the bot is made for vanilla gametypes and is map independent.
15:02 <+rand> some people like to play against it, mostly on DM 1o1
15:03 <+rand> the side effect is that there is always one player on the server so th server may appears at first place in the server list
15:06 <+rand> in fact, i miss the bot | royale, the server and its bot were fun to play with, way funnier than mine :c
15:20 < daey> 1on1'ing bots feels like a waste of time. the only way to beat them is hardcore cheesing. you wont stand a chance in a straight up battle
15:20 < daey> at least all the bot ive seen are frickn apm machines
15:21 <@heinrich5991> maybe the bot owners could restrict their APM to something humans can do
15:21 < daey> yeah but no one seems to do that :')
15:21 < daey> most of them are laser hammer death balls
15:22 <+rand> because that's more difficult to make them more human
15:22 < daey> well one could start by adding rng to their hammer aim :P
15:23 <+rand> there is in mine ^^
15:23 < daey> is your bot called angelina?
15:23 < daey> i think thats the one i played the most
15:24 <+rand> for every weapon
15:24 <+rand> it is
15:24 < daey> :P
15:24 < daey> the hammer doesnt feel all that random
15:24 <+rand> the error may be too small ^^'
15:24 < daey> haha
15:24 < daey> with ranged weapons its fine
15:24 <+rand> that's the same error for all weapons
15:24 < daey> but the second it hooks you its gg
15:24 <+rand> well, i cant deny that
15:25 < daey> well 1% error on the angle wouldnt matter in close range for the hammer
15:25 < daey> so melee weapons should have more angle rng. i think
15:25 <+rand> you can learn to stay far enough to avoid hammer :D
15:26 < daey> yeah thats what i meant with hardcore cheesing :'D
