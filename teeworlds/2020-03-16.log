00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> So itâ€™s just a lag and the Client predicts locally until the server snaps it back?
00:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> probably
00:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it looks like that @ChillerDragon
11:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> for the server you probably never unhooked
11:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i find this bug more with playerhooks, where the client gives me hook sound and animation and it snaps back to missed hook
11:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> there is nothing you can do against package loss
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well he insists on the bug being 0.7 only.. idk i cant reproduce
