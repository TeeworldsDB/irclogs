18:58 <@Dune> my cmake is too old to compile teeworlds :(
18:58 <@heinrich5991> version?
18:58 <@Dune> 3.5.1
18:59 <@heinrich5991> should be good
18:59 <@heinrich5991> what's the error?
18:59 <@Dune>   Cannot create CPack targets, CMake version too old.  Use CMake 3.6 or newer.  newer.
18:59 <@heinrich5991> that's fine
19:00 <@heinrich5991> you just can't use cpack (compiling teeworlds still works)
19:01 <@Dune> ah, I see :)
19:06 <@Dune> run_tests doesn't seem to be a valid target :|
19:06 <@Dune> code only fails with cmake somehow and I can't reproduce the issue
19:16 <@heinrich5991> you probably don't have gtest installed (should say so in the initial run)
19:16 <@heinrich5991> what's the failure?
19:19 <@Dune> CMake Error (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:200 (message):  DATA does not contain every file from directory datasrc
19:19 < minus> either botspam stopped or setting +s helped
19:19 <@Dune> huh
19:24 <@Dune> well libgtest-dev is installed
19:24 < minus> what's that?
19:24 < minus> sounds like something i wouldn't want on my system
19:24 < minus> oh, google's test framework
19:25 < minus> that doesn't make it any better unfortunately
19:26 < minus> rolling with custom testing "framework" at work, i.e. an array of function pointers that each return true/false to indicate the test result. works pretty well
19:29 <@heinrich5991> I think libgtest-dev only installed the source files, not the library, unfortunately :/
19:29 <@heinrich5991> Dune: try -DDOWNLOAD_GTEST=ON on the initial command line
19:29 <@heinrich5991> then it'll download and compile a version of gtest
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 0.7 supports cmake?
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> master 0.7 supports cmake
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> 0.7.2 does not, 0.7.3 will
