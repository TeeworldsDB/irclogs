01:41 < Commie> heyheyhey
01:44 < Commie> i don't understand the tournament rules for June 19
01:44 < Commie> am i allowed to drop extra scripts into ~/.teeworlds?
01:44 < Commie> am i allowed to use the client in the debian repos?
01:44 < Commie> can my username be ☭?
01:45 < heinrich5991> I think all three are to be answered with yes
01:45 < heinrich5991> I'm sure for the latter two
01:45 < Commie> :) excellent. does my teammate also need a challonge account?
01:46 < Commie> here's the thing about username: IRC does not support UTF-8 usernames, and the tournament rules say username must be same as irc nick. predicament, amirite?
01:46 < Commie> and who would need to verify the legitimacy of my .teewords?
01:47 < heinrich5991> nobody will verify the legitemacy of your teeworlds I guess
01:47 < heinrich5991> (note that I'm not someone who's authoritative on these questions)
01:48 < heinrich5991> but I think your team mate needs to be included in the challonge team as well
01:48 < Commie> kk. just... i do some funny stuff. would you join a server and tell me if what you see looks... like cheating, i guess?
01:48 < heinrich5991> can't search for you if you have that symbol as name
01:49 < Commie> i'm in soup bizkit
01:51 < Commie> DM2 servar

03:05 < elyksyr> well i can see why no one doesn't love you
03:05 < Commie> no one doesn't love me...
03:06 < Commie> in english this is a double negative
03:06 < Commie> it means everyone loves me
03:06 < Commie> is this what you meant?
03:06 < elyksyr> don't worry, like 1 in every 12 people understand that it was intentional so as to form an inside joke amongst a present group
03:06 < Commie> ok.
03:07 < Commie> well, i pwnpwnpwn
03:07 < Commie> and i can empty a pistol as fastasabot
03:07 < Commie> but i'm notabot
03:07 < elyksyr> this Train Your Dragon 2 advertisement on Pandora is a bitch
03:07 < elyksyr> seriously did they pay the Pandora developers to fuck over their non-premium listener like this?
03:07 < Commie> i don't accept advertisements in my content on the internet
03:07 < Commie> youtube-dl forever
03:08 < elyksyr> lol
03:08 < Commie> actually, i don't accept flash players
03:08 < Commie> i get the mp4 or gtfo
03:08 < elyksyr> I don't mind the advertisements as long as they're not excessive popups or like what Pandora's doing, with the ad fucking covering the screen transparently...
04:32 < Inedible> mmm pandora, wonder what that is
04:32 < Inedible> is that the crappy version of grooveshark?
04:32 < Commie> lololol
04:33 < Commie> it's the crappy version of last.fm
04:33 < Inedible> oh is that the crappy version of msn listening now plugins?
04:34 < Inedible> nah, last.fm is good, kind of
04:34 < Commie> kind of. for a service you never have to pay a penny for, that won't push ads, it's pretty ok
04:35 < Commie> as long as you don't have a specific track you want to listen to...
11:27 < teequest> hi ppl!
11:29 < teequest> I see that the first commit with milestone assigned to 0.7.0 branch is... "3 Sep 2010"...  Can you know why this release taking so long?
11:32 < teequest> anybody knows why?
11:33 < teequest> more work? few people working? It's free?
11:34 < teequest> sleeping channel?
11:34 <@minus> well, people develop teeworlds in their spare time, and might have better things to do
11:35 < teequest> minus ok thx :) but i can see that exist 26 pull request... ppl are working.. no?
12:15 < teequest> thx for all :) bb

12:56 <@minus> sup ghost91
12:56 < ghost91> not much, in a seminar right now, getting som stuff done for the tournament etc...
12:57 < ghost91> heinrich5991: you registered a team for the tournament, but you are the only member of the team. all players, who you want to be able to play for your team need to be in your team.
12:57 < ghost91> i.e. there need to be at least 2 members on our team
17:11 < Teeammate> hi everyone
17:12 <@minus> good afternoon
17:12 < Teeammate> I'm trying to configure automatic demo recording on the server side
17:12 < Teeammate> from the changelog I can see it available since 0.6.1
17:12 < Teeammate> but I cannot find which setting to change in the documentation
17:12 <@minus> :S
17:13 < Teeammate> I did find the record and stoprecord commands but nothing that explains how to do this automatically
17:13 < Teeammate> Is this indeed supported ?
17:14 < Teeammate> and hi minus. Thanks for any info
17:14 <@minus> i do not know
17:14 < Edible> he really wanted an answer

17:15 < Teeammate> thanks
17:15 <@minus> looking through the code
17:16 <@minus> CServer::DemoRecorder_HandleAutoStart

19:55 < BotoX> Someone noticed that I am literally the devil: https://github.com/BotoX
19:55 < BotoX> >Joined on Sep 11, 2010
19:55 < BotoX> 9/11 guise
19:55 <@minus> one year too early
19:55 < BotoX> heh
19:56 <@minus> i mean, 9 too late
19:56 <@minus> welp
19:56 <@minus> nice ava
19:56 <@minus> nice amount of commits
19:56 < BotoX> it keeps on dropping every week
19:56 < BotoX> and the teeworlds repo doesn't even count because it's a fork
20:02 < Learath2> can the bot just stay here instead of leaving after each and every announcement
20:03 <@minus> no
20:03 <@minus> it could send notices without joining
20:03 < Learath2> i think we have a flag that prevents outside messages
20:03 <@minus> we do
20:04 <@minus> i don't have the rights to remove it
20:36 <@minus> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=server_settings
20:36 <@minus> hmhm

20:47 < BeaR_> minus: Can you add a whitespace in 'client_commands.md' l.2: "read the [Client Config](client_config.md)doc." before "doc" ? :)
20:51 <@minus> ah right, saw that too
20:52 <@minus> there we go
20:52 < Teeworlds> [documentation] minus7 pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/ia2qAw
20:52 < Teeworlds> documentation/master de6802c m!nus: fixed markup of commands in tables
20:53 <@minus> now ican finally go back to configuring buildbot
21:02 < BeaR_> thanks (:
21:03 <@minus> now the question is: how do i get the generated data on teeworlds.com
21:04 <@minus> possiblity 1: rsync on the slave
21:04 <@minus> possiblity 2: rsync on the master
21:06 <@minus> possibility 3: make teeworlds.com a slave
21:24 < BotoX> https://github.com/django/django/pull/2692
21:25 < BotoX> check your privilege
21:29 < BotoX> pffffttt
21:33 <@minus> mv: cannot move ‘html’ to ‘asdf’: Directory not empty
21:33 <@minus> :S
21:33 < BotoX> lol
21:33 <@minus> rsync -av --delete then
22:12 <@minus> http://teeworlds.mnus.de/builders/builddocs/builds/7
22:12  * minus nods
22:17 <@minus> weird 600 permissions on the generated files :S
22:17 <@minus> and need to link the generated content into the page
22:17 <@minus> and need to use the github push webservice
22:17 <@minus> then it's done
22:28 <@minus> permissions were buildbot's fault (default umask 0077)
22:28 <@minus> pushing content into the page is hard, i can't just link out of the web page, chrooted :/
