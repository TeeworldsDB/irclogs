11:02 < needs> that's a clever design
11:05 <@minus> i wonder what matricks has to say about it
11:38 < EastByte> hm why do I not notice any tearing without vsync
11:48 <@minus> maybe something is forcing vsync
11:50 < EastByte> but cl_showfps shows a framerate way above my monitor frequency
11:51 < EastByte> but maybe the nvidia driver is doing something hacky and somehow only picks full frames
11:53 < EastByte> or my eyes do not notice the tearing anymore
12:21 < deen> double buffering
12:21 < deen> EastByte: ^
12:23 < deen> or not, who knows
12:36 < EastByte> hm
20:17 <@matricks> minus: lookin at it
20:23 <@matricks> minus: just a simple peice of software and a load waste of performance
20:25 <@minus> matricks: how else would you reduce latency while preventing tearing?
20:26 <@matricks> g-sync etc
20:26 <@minus> also, my original point is: what they're selling as fastsync IS triple buffering. it's existed since forever, just directx doesn't support it.
20:26 <@minus> true, g-sync/freesync is the better alternative
20:26 <@matricks> no, triple buffering is something else
20:26 <@minus> but not everyone has that
20:27 <@minus> no, triple buffering is exactly that
20:27 <@matricks> no it's not
20:27 <@minus> triple buffering is pre-rendering 2 frames?
20:27 <@matricks> minus: he even went through it at the end
20:27 <@matricks> minus: yes
20:27 <@minus> on direct x it is
20:28 <@minus> on opengl it can do what fastsync does
20:28 <@matricks> really?
20:28 <@minus> i'm pretty sure
20:29 <@minus> triple buffering doesn't make sense unless you do what fastsync claims
20:29 <@minus> unless you have a terrible instable performance and don't give a rats ass about latency
20:30 <@matricks> it smoothens out if you are at the limit what you can do
20:30 <@matricks> it helps if your framerate is uneven
20:30 <@matricks> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_buffering#/media/File:Comparison_double_triple_buffering.svg
20:30 <@matricks> and their so call freesync doesn't make sense unless you can render very fast
20:31 <@minus> fastsync*
20:31 <@matricks> fastsync yes
20:31 <@matricks> and you are just tossing performance out the window
20:31 <@minus> yes, you have to render multiple times faster than the refresh rate of the monitor
20:31 <@minus> kind of
20:32 <@matricks> yeah, I wonder if you get some sort of microstuttering due to the unevenness of frame progression
20:33 <@matricks> some people actually seems to describe tripple buffering the way fastsync works
20:33 <@matricks> ..
20:34 <@minus> wikipedia does, so do people
20:35 <@minus> what you and nvidia describe as triple buffering is called 3-buffer chain swap on wikipedia
