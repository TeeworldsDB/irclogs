00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> someone with a working python install needs to convert https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-translation/blob/5c26696437594b86cfb54abb3f45d6c9739b8ee7/slovak.json using https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/scripts/convert_l10n.py
00:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yikes im not sure about the skin greyfox. Its like one of the most popular community skins and blocking this name with a standard skin that looks different meh :/
01:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I agree including some community skins would have been nice, it's an all-new craft this time though. Helps with license at least I guess
01:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Maybe renaming it would be best?
01:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
01:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I think the swardy thing is fine. I assume it is also discussed with the artist and its not blocking the name.
01:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Who even created the greyfox skin? Was it greyfox him self? Its like just taking his work and editing it like it has always been like that.
01:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> (the original greyfox)
01:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <＃6909> Yea please rename greyfox to something else
01:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <＃6909> The skin is too famous to just block it like that, im not saying this one is bad, it looks cool too, but the name should be different, and i think most players would agree
02:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it most likely was not greyfox himself ._. I'd guess. it's just a grey fox
02:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <＃6909> I think ddnet's skin database shows author names, maybe if you search for greyfox there you may find who did it
02:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does anyone know how a server tells a client what kind of GUI to use, like team based, race, dm(dunno does lms have a different UI)?
08:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> usually via the `GameInfo` (these days a net message apparently
08:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there's a `m_GameFlags` member
08:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Dune updated slovak
08:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Thanks
10:37 <@Dune> Should be last day for translations
10:45 < Oy> yeah
10:45 < Oy> what else has to be done for the release?
10:48 <@Dune> Merge PRs :p 
10:49 <@Dune> Statboard, a fix in the ig browser background thing, and make all the default filter 
10:51 <@Dune> 2242 was on my todo list but its tight
10:52 < Oy> make all the default filter ?
10:52 <@Dune> My implem bugs
10:52 <@Dune> Yeah you said you wanted to ddo that iirc
10:52 <@Dune> The browser filter
10:53 < Oy> already done
11:02 <@Dune> Ah nvm then
11:05 <@Dune> I'll do stuff this afternoon
11:06 <@Dune> Not sure what to do with the wide GUI stuff
11:24 < Oy> about the icon? will check it out later
11:57 <@Dune> And the general idea of doing that. Can scrap if it's not good 
12:46 < Oy> well, u had lots of positive feedback, so why not add it
12:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I feel like the ui should be either small or wide, no need to add an icon to switch between
12:55 <@Dune> Yeah that is kinda my concern
12:56 <@Dune> Is the improvement significant enough to justify an option
12:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Just make it permanent. It was one thing that 0.6 did much better, the server browser was large and better to use.
13:04 <@Dune> The filters aren't a success either. But well, it's hard to remove possibilities from such a game ^^
13:06 <@Dune> By the way, the hedgewars dude are ahead of us and did 1.0 :D
13:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I like to enjoy the background theme behind the ui tho
13:13 <@Dune> Me too, I love it! But it's very controversial 
13:15 < Oy> i always use a 4:3 window, so wouldn't be any different for me :)
13:15 < Oy> 1.0 will take a while :D
13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 1.0 lol
13:22 <@Dune> I mean they did it because they decided the game has everything they want it to have
13:22 <@Dune> It all depends on where you set your objectives I guess :)
13:23 <@Dune> I think inline server info ought to be black bg, white is strange :/
13:24 <@Dune> Maybe @Sonix would design a minimize/maximize icon couple? Would save some font trouble:)
13:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well then 0.6 could be 1.0 already imo
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <＃6909> I always thought hedgewars had something to do with teeworlds
13:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <＃6909> And yea 0.6 looks like a full release, as 0.7 took a whole new perspective of the game with a lot of changes
13:53 <@Dune> I agree chiller
14:14 <@Dune> @lordsk thanks for the fix
14:21 < Oy> hm client is broken
14:22 < Oy> nvm
14:31 < uovobw> hi *
14:39 <@Dune> hi
14:40 <@Dune> oh, top left corner doesn't blend well with the tabs thing :)
14:40 <@Dune> should we `bool IsOnlineBrowser = Client()->State == ACTIVE` or is that clear enough?
14:41 < Oy> guess it's clear
14:42 < Oy> use that icon https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2316#issuecomment-567167383 for the finish message too?
14:43 <@Dune> I thought it was for the finish message in the first place @Sonix
14:46 < Oy> that blue text colour of finish message is a bit hard to read
14:49 < Oy> on blue background of ctf5 at least
14:50 <@Dune> Yeah I agree, make it lighter
14:53 <@Dune> Try this one: const vec4 CRCWhisper(0.0f, 0.5f, 1.0f, 0.5f*Blend);
14:55 <@Dune> Oy: I'm worried about this line: 				str_format(aImprovement, sizeof(aImprovement), Localize(" (%s seconds faster)"), aTime);
14:55 <@Dune> the localize includes a space that most translators will probably forget
14:56 <@Dune> The only fix I see is a hardcoded test on the first character of the locstring
15:06 < Oy> Dune: yeah should remove that space
15:06 <@Dune> yeah but only after release
15:07 <@Dune> I can't test the finish messages cause I can't set a record :(
15:07 < Oy> dunno if all current translations have the space
15:08 <@Dune> I bet none do :p
15:08 < Oy> if we check, then we can fix it while on it :D
15:08 < Oy> join the fastcap server
15:08 < Oy> and try a map u didn't test before for a new record :)
15:09 < Oy> or change name :D
15:09 <@Dune> oh
15:09 <@Dune> good idea :D
15:16 <@Dune> ./top5 should be an alias on /rank Candyx*
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/657950107093696513/screenshot_2019-12-21_14-17-36.png
15:21 <@Dune> 0.2/0.6/1.0 instead of 0/0.5/1.0
15:22 < Oy> yeah that looks better
15:22 <@Dune> https://pastebin.com/tgRjnmQL
15:34 < Oy> Dune: would go for that colour
15:34 <@Dune> go then
15:35 <@Dune> I'm trying to color the statboard with crosshair colors
15:42 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/p9sJ27n.png
15:45 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> why does my grappling hook drop me every time?
15:45 <@Dune> sounds like network issues
15:45 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> it works according to ping it seems like
15:45 <@Dune> ctrl+shift+d+g
15:46 <@Dune> do you get big drops in the prediction graph?
15:46 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> eh?
15:46 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> let me see
15:51 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> graph has noticeable spikes as connects? but when the issue happens, no noticeable dip or spike in noise
15:51 <@Dune> hmmm
15:51 <@Dune> wonder what causes this then
15:51 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> is there a default reset time on the status of the hook grab?
15:51 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> a default "check again" time?
15:53 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> also, has anybody made a web version? it seems like it could run on the same server as django and serve up positions data and render the thing in javascript
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Web version wouldn't work well... There is no way to use the udp protocol in the browser so the latency would be bad
16:03 <@Dune> there was a web version yeah
16:03 <@Dune> i think 0.7 even
16:05 < koomi> redix: there is webrtc
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> can i ask for german locale?
16:05 < koomi> don't know much about it though
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> in race: 12.012,037 seconds
16:06 <@Dune> @Assa sorry what?
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> hmm, nevermind
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you use 00:09.123
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> in your example
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i would cut the `00:` if its 0
16:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Yeah but webrtc is pretty complex and designed for peer to peer. It would at least be some work...
16:12 < koomi> true
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/657970370833416194/screenshot_2019-12-21_15-38-56.png
16:39 <@Dune> there was a suggestion to make the border more saturated, but it doesn't work well
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/657970812271329311/screenshot_2019-12-21_15-40-50.png
16:41 <@Dune> this might work though
17:07 <@Dune>  [2019-12-21 16:06:12][pFont]: error loading glyph 79 [2019-12-21 16:06:12][pFont]: error loading glyph 79 [2019-12-21 16:06:12][pFont]: error loading glyph 89
17:07 <@Dune> huh, I was lacking the O and the Y of the font
17:40 < Oy> Dune: hm that's odd
17:41 <@Dune> only happened once
17:41 <@Dune> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/b37a017cee61adf1ef3997ccd9651d4d/screenshot_2019-12-21_16-06-09.png
17:42 < Oy> screenshot is of ur client?
17:42 <@Dune> master 
17:42 <@Dune> ah wait not sure
17:42 < Oy> no wait, ur pc?
17:42 <@Dune> oh actually not, it's my client,
17:42 <@Dune> linux pc yes
17:43 <@Dune> last updated to master in summer or so
17:43 < Oy> oh
17:44 < Oy> looks like sth broken in the client
17:44 <@Dune> did you see sth?
17:44 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1693#issuecomment-568192502
17:44 <@Dune> do we have updates with this
17:44 < Oy> the messed up strings, they should work correct
17:45 < Oy> will try to use 2.10 sdl2 and test
17:46 <@Dune> guessing how the width of the statboard columns works is hell :p
17:47 < Oy> :P
17:56 < Oy> sdl2.10 seems fine for me
18:00 < Oy> hm, tested 2.9 to make sure and can't produce that bug with it
18:00 < Oy> @LordSk could you test with sdl 2.10?
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Hum sure
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> what was the issue again?
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Oh I see I found it
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> 100 * 20 * 5min = 1 week, oh no, i have to train my neural net 1 week :C
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I can't reproduce it on 2.10
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Can you on 2.9?
18:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> no
18:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> We actually don't print the sdl version though, so it is hard to be sure 100%
18:58 < Oy> odd, but i could reproduce it back then
18:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah so did I
18:58 < Oy> maybe it was a windows bug, which got fixed by A WINDOWS UPDATE
18:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> or a driver issue
18:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> my setup has completely changed since then as well
18:59 < Oy> didn't update my gpu driver
18:59 < Oy> same setup for me
18:59 < Oy> just windows updates
19:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> are we sure it was a sdl issue at the time?
19:00 < Oy> it worked with sdl2.8 and before, just not with 2.9
19:00 < Oy> never tried sth else
19:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah but I mean it might have been a side effect
19:01 < Oy> yeah
19:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and we fixed our code without knowing
19:01 < Oy> we didn't touch anything in teeworlds in that regard
19:02 < Oy> could test the 0.7.3 release though :)
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> meh if it ain't broken
19:04 < Oy> tested 0.7.3.1 release with sdl2.9 works
19:05 < Oy> so we can update to sdl2.10 and close the issue i guess
19:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> what does sdl 2.10 give us?
19:07 < Oy> dunno
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> If 2.0.8 isn't broken..
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> According to some ddnet issue (opened recently) some people have problems with 2.0.9 and 2.0.10
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I cannot reproduce it myself
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah so let's stay on 2.0.8 then
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> what is the issue they're having?
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1997
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> It's closed because they downgraded to 2.0.8
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Not sure what's the exact issue. Runs fine for me
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> It might run worse on lower end machines
19:20 < Oy> runs the same for me too
20:26 <@Dune> so let's go with 2? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2318
20:32 < Oy> i'd vote for 1 :D
20:34 <@Dune> I don't have a preference
20:34 <@Dune> @LordSk @Sonix @Zatline
20:34 < Oy> anyone in chat?
20:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> 3
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> wait 2
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I assume the first screenshot is not an option 😄
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I kinda like the big "Browser" button too
20:36 <@Dune> gerdoe12/14/2019 Sonix second better
20:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Zatline said 2 on the issue as well
20:49 < Oy> isn't the 1st icon the common icon for the web?
20:50 < Oy> but maybe i'm just getting old
20:53 <@Dune> it might be a bit old fashioned yeah
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/658034583719378944/screenshot_2019-12-21_19-53-55.png
20:54 <@Dune> doesn't look great
20:55 < Oy> yeah looks strange
20:55 <@Dune> size issue
20:56 <@Dune> should we keep the "Settings" as in https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/355114/70849761-d5cc4980-1e7a-11ea-8a52-b66cbd6589b1.png or try to work around it?
20:57 < Oy> u mean the name?
20:58 <@Dune> yeah
21:00 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2331
21:00 < Oy> not sure
21:00 < Oy> though it would be nice to have it consistent
21:01 < Oy> but then should it be left next to the quit button?
21:01 < Oy> and what about the start screen, use the icon there too?
21:01 < Oy> dunno where to stop :D
21:02 <@Dune> Definitely don't use an icon on the start screen
21:02 <@Dune> I think it's fine to have it as an icon ingame, but the size must be equal to that of the globe
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Icon sucks, call it simply browser
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or at least a consistent "naming" scheme
21:26 <@Dune> There is no "browser" anywhere else, so it's consistent. I find the icon to be a significant upgrade and it frees some space so we keep the separator :)
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I have a comparison to th egamer client, which sadly does not use a consistent naming scheme, where you have to kinda look for the browser every time, one might get used to it, but it's confusing at the beginning. The consistency is referring to all of the other tabs that are visible next to the "Browser" tab in the esc-overview
21:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> "Text", "Text", "Icon", "Text"
21:42 <@Dune> Do you also struggle to locate the settings in the browser?
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> settings?
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what kind of settings are there Oo?
22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm not testing trunk ._.
22:03 <@Dune> the settings button is an icon there
22:05 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/KNn5q6L.png wonder why the bars look pixelated
22:06 <@Dune> all-same width seems fine, I could experiment with width depending on the # of kills if you want
22:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I literally do not see anything that might be considered a settings icon in that screenshot
22:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what about ninja kills :D?
22:07 <@Dune> they are there too
22:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok 😮
22:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> black?
22:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dark grey?
22:08 <@Dune> the color of the crosshair
22:12 < Oy> value for corners too big?
22:21 <@Dune> but they seem to be good for less than 14 players :/
22:21 <@Dune> hmm let's lower them then
22:23 <@Dune> you were right Oy :)
22:24 < Oy> :P
22:25 <@Dune> not sure if a death bar is so relevant tho
22:26 <@Dune> maybe grabs should be moved next to captures
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> could we use the levinsthein distance for nickname matching .-.
22:30 <@Dune> go ahead
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :'c
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there are reference implementations ._.
22:30 <@Dune> then use them!
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :'c
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> could you tell me where that exact part is in the client?
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> with tab auto completion
22:31 <@Dune> search for `KEY_TAB`
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok
22:46 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> hey, how do I do the graph of network performance thing again?
22:46 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> ctrl shift j k or something
22:46 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> ?
22:46 <@Dune> G
22:46 <@Dune> ctrl+shift+g, JewZeus
22:46 <@Dune> but you need debug mode (c-shift-d) for that
22:53 <@Dune> the statboard PR is done/awaiting critics fyi
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> any screenshots ._.
23:13 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> so ctrl shift d g
23:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does the tw coding guide allow lambda expressions ._.
23:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or the auto keyword?
23:38 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> the code's on github innit?
23:53 <@Dune> Choscura: yes
23:54 <@Dune> @jxsl13 anything that is in C++03 is a yes. Those are more modern features
23:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ... why the heck c++03, why not 11 ._.
23:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is there a flag somewhere to enforce that in like cmake or bam?
23:57 <@Dune> not everything that you *can* do, you *should* do :)
23:57 <@Dune> code simplicity is wealth
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> auto superniceVariableName = lambda function()
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 😮
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> code comments are wealth ._.
23:58 <@Dune> good code should need little to no comments
23:59 <@Dune> most modern c++ features are good only if used sparsely and wisely
23:59 <@Dune> when you get autos everywhere you don't know what is what ;)
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I do not intend to use if anywhere else other than for lambdas ._.
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it
