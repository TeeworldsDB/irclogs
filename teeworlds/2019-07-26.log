20:19 < bridge> [freenode] <Switch_T> heinrich5991, hello
20:54 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> hi
20:56 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> I'm afraid we don't have docs on creating simple modifications
20:56 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> have you downloaded the source code already?
21:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Depends on what you want to do exactly but basic color changes works with binds already.
22:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> player_color_body
22:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> player_color_feet
22:02 < Dune> go there for compiling info: https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=CompilingEverything
22:03 < Dune> you need programming skills to do stuff in teeworlds though, there is no shortcut
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> most servers won't show your "rainbow" at all, if you do it on client side, and all updates will every 5 seconds
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> on serverside it will work
22:48 < Dune> yeah it's annoying and they added a protection against that somewhen in 0.6
