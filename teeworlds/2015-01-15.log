15:50 <@minus> modular editor UI?
15:50 < MAP94> yep
15:51 <@minus> would a native UI make more sense?
15:52 < MAP94> native? the os ui?
15:52 <@minus> not necessarily, but something like Qt/wx/Gtk
15:54 < MAP94> meh  i dont like to add one of these libs. imo its not needed
15:58 < MAP94> if you guys know blender then you can imagin what this could look like later
16:31 < JulianAssange> MAP94: that looks very nice
17:15 < baklava-tee> Can binds work when I am not ingame? Like when I am in the browser list.
17:16 < baklava-tee> Sometimes I need "bind f minimize" for example.
17:17 <@matricks> "yes"
17:17 <@matricks> but only f1-f11238 keys
17:18 < baklava-tee> Ok, thanks
18:07 < JulianAssange> matricks: f13 is best button
18:07 < JulianAssange> (pls don't tell me about f15, because I already know)
18:08 < JulianAssange> lol, according to wikipedia, the IBM 5250 had 24 function keys
18:14 < MAP94> IMB 1 : 0 Julian :P

21:33 < morphles> Can I decrease crosshair distance limit without recompile?
21:34 <@matricks> cl_mouse_max_distance
21:40 < morphles> Thanks, what walue would you recommend? Or what is popular in high level play?
21:40 < morphles> 800 (what I think was default) seems way way exceesive
21:41 < laxa> default is 600 or 400
21:43 < morphles> Hm mine somehow was 800, but I think I'll try to live with 150
21:44 <@matricks> default is 800
