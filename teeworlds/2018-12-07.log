20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> > when you put debug points everywhere to find out what randomly sets m_Angle to 0
20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> > it's an int
20:27 < rand> had the same issue when changing the UI :3
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I'm not sure if I'm a big fan of implicit float>int conversions
20:29  * rand searching a GCC flag for this
20:31 < rand> found -Wconversion
20:43 <@Dune> guess that doesn't work on clang :<
20:43 <@Dune> I wonder how many warnings that would proc
20:46 < koomi> it should work in clang
20:46 < koomi> -Wfloat-conversion if you only want that warning and not all the other stuff that -Wconversion does
20:54 <@Dune> thanks :)
21:03 < rand> clang has also a -Weverything iirc
