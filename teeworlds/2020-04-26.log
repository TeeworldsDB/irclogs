09:08 < ChillerDragon> Imo the less smoke trail there is on the nade the cheaper it looks what was the reason for halfing it? Performance boost?
09:08 < ChillerDragon> not sure about the other effects
09:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Probably ninja pickup as well
10:01 < Oy> the code indicates that it was a bug and was supposed to be like that
10:01 < Oy> didn't test but doubt there's much of a performance bost
10:02 < Oy> but there's no problem in changing it back
10:02 < Oy> if there's a performance boost. maybe chain it to high detail graphic setting
10:10 < ChillerDragon> yea maybe on low end devices halfing particels can cause fps boost but my personal taste is more smoke better look but idk if i have representative opinions
10:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> to mix things up - i like low variance smoke
12:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I have not tested enough to give a personal preference but imo there is no reason to suddenly change this - revert it
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> less smoke better ðŸ˜®
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> x)
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I find the particle effects on pistole/shotgun projectiles often times distracting
18:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I'm not quite familiar with how quads work, why do we create a huge quad for the bg (800,600) but we create a (50, 50) game layer
19:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> no mappers around? ðŸ˜›

20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 4:3 aspect ratio vs (64x50)x(64x50) pixel
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe
20:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the default layers size is in any case just a default value that's been there forever. nobody cares about that, as it's usually changed anyway.
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I find the particle effects on pistole/shotgun projectiles distracting
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i think quads and layers are calculated differently. 800,600 is the distance from the origin/pivot which is enough to cover "proof"/display view. Its not that huge in my opinion, its size as a layer would be 50, 38

22:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> masters are under attack? i see my server has problems registering
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> website is down too
23:12 < rand> my server got registered 1min ago on master3
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> Is there a function to change skins with a server command?
23:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no, lol.
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :0 a c++ function, kind of, but no command
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> I wrote "function" xD, I didnt mean a already exist server command
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> I want to create a command where I can change skins
