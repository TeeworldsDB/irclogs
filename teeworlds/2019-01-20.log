00:16 <@Dune> the votekick sometimes seems to bug out, and require one less vote than it should
00:16 <@Dune> can't see why
11:11 <@Dune> I wonder if the license chat over at https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=tired_matricks comes from a time when the license was different
11:16 < Oy> it's about changing to the current one
11:19 <@Dune> isn't the current one super permissive?
11:20 < Oy> yeah
11:23 <@Dune> I wonder what people complained about then
11:24 < Oy> people always find sth to complain about ;)
11:27 < Oy> i remember discussions about graphics (f.e. tilesets) and authors not happy that others could use it in commercial stuff
11:30 <@Dune> ahh
11:39 <@Dune> any idea what "has to be done in 3rd person" mean?
11:41 < Oy> the mod creators have to take care/fix their stuff themself
