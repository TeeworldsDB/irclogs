03:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: are you the one maintaining the matrix bridge?
03:12 <@heinrich5991> minus: I don't know who has access to teeworlds.com DNS, do you?
03:13 <@heinrich5991> could you change master4.teeworlds.com from the CNAME master.ddnet.tw to CNAME master.ddnet.org?
03:13 <@heinrich5991> nothing time critical, but would be nice to have in the next year
03:30 < bridge> <chillerdragon> No. Wasnâ€™t it zwelf?
08:00 < bridge> <Zwelf> Yes, it's me maintaining the bridge. Sadly we can't make the room read only by default like in discord. https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-discord/issues/843
08:02 < bridge> <Zwelf> I'd be fine with turning this bridge off again. We still have the irc and there is a too high spam ratio from matrix.
10:41 < minus> heinrich5991: noted, will do in the evening
17:28 < bridge> <Zwelf> I made the matrix-room invite only for now. Should keep working and spam shouldn't appear anymore. If anyone wants to join I can invite them. I know it's a lot less accessible, but also keeps working until a better solution exists.
17:30 < bridge> <heinrich5991> thanks Zwelf ðŸ™‚
18:01 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah nice
18:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: where can I DM you, btw?
18:28 < bridge> <heinrich5991> does IRC work?
19:11 < bridge> <Dune> Thx zwelf
19:44 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 matrix,wire,irc
21:25 < minus> heinrich5991: done
21:57 <@heinrich5991> minus: thanks! looks good
