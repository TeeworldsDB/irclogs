07:03 <@minus> completely doing the outlines with shaders might not be such a bad idea though
16:54 < Siile> Hi!
16:54 < Siile> is there a way to tell if tee got hit (damaged) from client side?
16:58 < BotoX> you lost HP? :O
16:58 < BotoX> how about that
16:59 <@matricks> the eyes change when taking damage, look how that is done
17:00 < Siile> I guess I'll go with the eyes
17:13 < heinrich5991> there's also stars and health lsot
17:16 < Siile> unfortunately damage indicators are not tied to players 
17:19 < heinrich5991> yep
17:19 < heinrich5991> but you could check which damage indicator belongs to you
17:20 <@matricks> just check how the eyes are done
17:20 < Siile> already done it with the eyes ;)
17:20 < Siile> now just fine adjusting
17:26 < heinrich5991> don't you get the same eyes elsewhere? like on blinking?
17:27 < Siile> pain eyes?
17:27 < Siile> just a sec, I'll upload a clip to youtube so u'll see what I'm doing :P
17:28 < heinrich5991> I guess you're giving the red screen effect on hit?
17:28 < Siile> red tee effect
17:28 < Siile> shaders are nice
17:29 < heinrich5991> I'm not sure if you need shaders for that
17:29 < heinrich5991> but if it works, great :)
17:37 < Siile> have a look: http://youtu.be/awWkN_P-5Hs

17:41 < Siile> looks better in-game
17:54 <@minus> shaders are the right way to do it
17:54 <@minus> Siile: doesn't look bad for a start
17:54 < Siile> y
17:55 <@minus> but your billy talent in the background was getting in the way of my trivium
17:55 < Siile> yy :D
17:55 < Siile> forgot it on
17:55  * minus np: Trivium - The End Of Everything
17:55 < Siile> I'll try adding motion blur to hadouken later
17:55 <@minus> you mean the ninja dash?
17:56 < Siile> y
19:12 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: what kind of tool? (concerning issue #1222)
19:19 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: to undo tileset-borderfix
19:54 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: hm possible, but the output wouldn't be really better probably /:
20:25 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: yes. but it's some compatibility at least
21:09 < Siile> playing teeworlds with gamepad is amazing ^_____^
21:11 <@minus> works out of the box? intredasting.
21:12 < Siile> feels nice to be noob again
