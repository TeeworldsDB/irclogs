00:17 <@Dune> "Uh, so my server was lying too?(i tried hosting earlier and got 64/8)(edited)
00:17 <@Dune> Pure server just out of the zip"
00:17 <@Dune> @WsY[FU]?
00:48 < rand> then, either the zip is not official or the binaries are from a test build

10:54 <@Dune> rand: so apparently it's a win7 x64 pure 0.7.1 zip that does this, without any autoexec config...
10:54 <@Dune> the issue reportedly triggers with sv_register 0 too, so it's not a man-in-the-middle thing
10:58 <@Dune> damn, just reproduced
10:58 < rand> who made this zip ?
10:58 <@Dune> Oy
10:58 <@Dune> I compile on x64 normally and I don't get this problem. He might have compiled the wrong branch or something :/
10:58 < rand> then Oy might have build some test build
11:01 <@Dune> that's most likely, yeah :(
11:02 <@Dune> by the way, win64 is fine but win32 triggers avira
11:03 <@Dune> okay, win32 is the same issue. Oy took some sort of test branch. RIP
11:08 <@Dune> I reported the issue. not sure what is the best course of action in this scenario
11:08 <@Dune> I can put a warning next to the download links
11:11 <@Dune> what do you think, rand, minus?
11:14 < rand> +1 for removing win64 and adding warning
11:16 <@Dune> win32 same issue
11:17 < rand> erk
11:17 <@Dune> The client is fine though :/ sucks to block downloads like that
11:29 <@Dune> put a warning, didn't remove the download though (yet)
12:26 < Oy> hey
12:26 <@Dune> hey
12:27 <@Dune> got an issue with windows release
12:27 < Oy> ?
12:28 <@Dune> the x32/x64 server release is the wrong version
12:28 <@Dune> it broadcasts 64 fake players to the
12:28 <@Dune> probably one of your local branches
12:28 < Oy> oh, that's my version
12:28 <@Dune> yeah
12:29 <@Dune> for now I did https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=downloads
12:29 < Oy> will fix
12:29 <@Dune> was wondering if we should ban those lying servers yesterday :x
12:29 <@Dune> thanks
12:37 < Oy> Dune: fixed the ones on github
12:37 <@Dune> lemme test
12:37 <@Dune> I'll have to bug minus to reupload :c
12:38 <@Dune> It's important to fix the teeworlds download links because they've been copied on community sites
12:38 <@Dune> ah, nevermind, the github links were never replaced
12:38 < rand> could this links be redirection to github release ?
12:38 <@Dune> they already were
12:39 <@Dune> the 0.6.4 are too
12:39 < Oy> but frontpage needs to be fixed. links to downloads.teeworlds
12:42 <@Dune> Oh, indeed
12:42 <@Dune> On Windows it proposes 32 bit by default
12:42 < Oy> yeah
12:42 <@Dune> the 32 bit version triggers Avira on Windows though
12:43 <@Dune> the 64 doesn't
12:43 <@Dune> got a bunch of reports of that
12:43 <@Dune> oh well
12:43 < Oy> the 0.7.1 version too?
12:43 <@Dune> yeah
12:43 <@Dune> 0.6.5 triggered avira both on 32 and 64 bit
12:43 <@Dune> (iirc)
12:44 <@Dune> Updated https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=downloads
12:45 < Oy> good
12:48 <@Dune> sent heinrich5991a mail for the steam port
12:54 < Oy> yeah, good

13:00 < Oy> https://www.virustotal.com/de/file/0d1fc8bda2f6ec729fffb85691815adf29c62fa3e7c6cc6e869c4c314c80a800/analysis/1544874356/ avira seems clean there
13:01 <@Dune> strange
13:02 < Oy> maybe old version/definitions
13:06 < minus> yes hello
13:09 <@Dune> can you reupload win32/win64 on downloads.teeworlds.com from https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/releases? :)
13:53 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed pull request #1868: sort by real players/clients (master...fix/1867) https://git.io/fpbdP
13:53 <@Dune> I got a message from Ubu this morning Oy. I can invite him
13:54 < Oy> is that the real one from the past?
13:54 <@Dune> almost surely, but I'll ask for an ID check on the
13:54 <@Dune> forums
13:55 <@Dune> @ubu
13:55 < Oy> sonix and magnet should know if it's the real one, they were in the same clan
13:56 <@Dune> that too, yeah
13:56 <@Dune> wrote a mail to Landil yesterday
13:57 < Oy> the forum one?
13:57 <@Dune> Yeah, might not be the right one
13:57 < Oy> have his private one
13:57 <@Dune> Go ahead then
13:57 < Oy> u didn't get an answer yet right?
13:58 <@Dune> no
13:58 < minus> Dune: done
13:58 <@Dune> oh, thank you minus
13:58 < Oy> thx minus \o/
14:13 < Oy> wrote him an email
14:14 <@Dune> thx
14:20 < Oy> hey magnet
14:21 < magnet> io :)
14:22 < magnet> I've replied to a bunch of posts -- so much activity :). I've been way more available the last 2 years and everything resumes when I must attend to other busines ;)
14:22 < magnet> business*
14:24 < Oy> hehe. wasn't planned. just happened :D
14:27 < magnet> it's cool, and 0.7 feels good in terms of playing. very smooth/lightweight. I could be a monster there if I had time and if someone was playing it ;P
14:36 < Ryozuki> i certainly didnt expect this tw dev comeback, i thought there was rly no hope
15:28 < Oy> well, thought so too. there have been attempts to revive tw before, but they burst. good that it worked this time
15:52 <@Dune> we don't have anyone else than heinrich5991 and minus for server bans afaik :/
15:53 < minus> do you want, Dune?
15:54 <@Dune> sure. magnet works too
15:55 < minus> send me a pubkey so you can ssh in to edit the master bans
15:57 < Oy> is there still a public list of the bans?
15:57 <@Dune> yes
15:57 <@Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/master-bans.cfg
15:57 <@Dune> also https://status.tw/?p=masterbans
15:58 < Oy> ok good
17:00 < Oy> the luttyz guy needs to update the server
18:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah unfortunately we have no way to contact him now and it misleads others in thinking that the hack still works, which is one big reason to update
18:18 < Oy> could wait a day or two if the server gets updated and then remove him from the masters in case it didn't
18:50 <@Dune> it's been up for 2 days already :/
18:55 < Dune_linux> strange, ssh teeworlds.com -i id_rsa doesn't work. I smell PEBCAK
18:58 < rand> the server will be dropped with 0.7.2â€¦ well, not before 2019 I guess (except if security issue)
18:59 < rand> Dune_linux: -vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
18:59 < rand> maybe more v, not sure
19:00 < Dune_linux> debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password debug1: Next authentication method: publickey
19:02 < Dune_linux> nothing in the log seems to say the key didn't work 
19:08 <@Dune> any obvious reason why ssh refuses auth/prompts with a password?
19:42 < koomi> permissions on authorized_keys?
19:44 < minus> Dune: try again
19:44 < minus> there's this sshd_config directive named AllowedUsers
19:44 <@Dune> works, thank you, minus
19:46 < minus> let me just drop that and disable password authenticion while at it
19:56 < Oy> when the animation of the heaven background map starts over, the clouds suddenly appear on the starting position out of thin air
19:58 <@Dune> yeah
19:58 <@Dune> they reset
19:58 < Oy> should probably be a continuous animation
19:59 < Oy> never seen it on dm1 f.e.
19:59 < Oy> maybe didn't notice :)
19:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix
20:04 < Oy> someone else with a mac here?
20:25 <@Dune> @MertenNor
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <MertenNor> its a really old version but yes
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <MertenNor> running hackintosh at the moment
20:29 < Oy> MertenNor can you repoduce this https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1860 ?
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <MertenNor> my mac version is to old for that
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <MertenNor> sorry
20:30 < Oy> ok
21:05 <@Dune> I contacted the luttyz guy, he updated his server :)
21:15 < Oy> cool
21:17 <@heinrich5991> which 0.7.1 binaries does downloads.teeworlds.com?
21:17 <@heinrich5991> should I update them to the github ones?
21:17 <@Dune> download.teeworlds.com = github thanks to minus
21:18 <@heinrich5991> great :)
21:18 < minus> oh, heinrich5991 is alive
21:18 <@heinrich5991> kinda
21:20 <@heinrich5991> is anyone on windows with steam right now?
21:21 <@Dune> i can
21:21 < Oy> could start steam
21:22 <@heinrich5991> try the test branch please
21:22 <@heinrich5991> (beta code "testtesttest")
21:24 <@Dune> aight
21:24 <@Dune> what should i try
21:24 <@heinrich5991> running it
21:24 <@Dune> client works fine
21:24 <@heinrich5991> if it executes, it's probably fine
21:24 <@heinrich5991> k, ty
21:24 <@heinrich5991> build is live for windows now
21:25 <@Dune> avira kills the server, as usual
21:25 <@Dune> cool, thanks
21:25 <@heinrich5991> we could report a false positive to avira if anyone is motivated

21:28 <@heinrich5991> Please do not submit spam emails to our analysis system. Spam is advertisement which does not contain any malicious content. 
21:28 <@heinrich5991> :D
21:28 <@heinrich5991> I hate it when I get advertisement without malicious content
21:28 <@Dune> haha
21:28 < Oy> :P
21:29 < Oy> got steam update. good :)
21:30 < Oy> wondering why https://www.virustotal.com/de/file/0d1fc8bda2f6ec729fffb85691815adf29c62fa3e7c6cc6e869c4c314c80a800/analysis/1544874356/ is clean for avira
21:31 <@Dune> good question
21:41 <@Dune> motd doesn't always show up, depending on the server
21:41 <@Dune> not sure why
21:50 < Iligy> Hi
21:50 <@Dune> hi
22:51 <@heinrich5991> Dune: who built the mac version?
22:51 <@Dune> Oy iirc
22:51 <@heinrich5991> hm. he just left
22:51 <@Dune> huh. he could have introduced the same bug there, eh
22:52 <@heinrich5991> probably not, I mean it's likely a separate machine
22:52 <@Dune> yeah
23:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> heinrich5991: I found my old maps thanks to your amazing website, thank you so much for keeping them ðŸ˜„
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> np ðŸ™‚
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @LordSk do you happen to have an old downloadedmaps folder with maps that I could add to the archive? ðŸ˜‰
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I don't think so no, I lost most of my old stuff
