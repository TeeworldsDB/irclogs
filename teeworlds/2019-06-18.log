17:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Uff the new editor is soo hard to get used to ._. Imo it feels like you have way less control when  navigating. Why did that change?
17:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> What new editor?
17:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> try the ctrl thingy navigation
17:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> press ctrl and click drag. And try not to get dizzy :c
17:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> It adds some acceleration or something like that. In 0.6 it was more precise you navigate the speed your mouse is navigating not more.

17:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Also the gun bullets are offset in 0.7
17:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Didn't know the editor had acceleration
17:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ya its the worst
17:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> did u try the difference?
17:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> after 6+ years of mapping this is reeeaally confusing and doesn't help upgrading to 0.7

18:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cant reporduce... i have no friends lol
18:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no but seriously i dont have this "Browser" tab
18:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah its a mockup
18:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah looked like a bug report
18:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xxxd
18:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> because of the glitchy stuff down there
18:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but i thought the ingame browser is already there since https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1636 is merged
18:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> its not
18:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> merged
18:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah true xd
18:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> green is open and merge is blue^^
18:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Sonix do we even have an inivite system?
18:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Sounds like a struggel to me to implement that and more like a 0.8 thing
19:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> You can't invite players, there is no p2p in teeworlds
19:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah sadly
20:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> That would bring a bunch of problems
20:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Like?
20:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> freedom and decentralization xd
20:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nah probably some possibility for attacks. And sounds complicated to implement o.O
20:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but we could use master servers for player2player communication instead of peer2peer
21:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix no modern games let you know your opponents' IP, for good reasons
21:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> master servers are a weak point and should be used as little as possible imo, ideally they shouldn't even exist
21:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I wonder if we get youtube videos advertising "my best teeworlds server [FULL HD]" like in minecraft if we kill the masters hehe
