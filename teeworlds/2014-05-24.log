01:53 < Edible> loving that /topic
07:51 <@minus> matricks: could you hand me your even non-working code base? it's easier to get started with that than from zero :3
07:55 <@matricks> https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs
07:55 <@matricks> https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/blob/master/src/examples/triangle.rs
07:57 <@minus> i guess that works too
07:57 <@minus> thanks :D
07:57 <@matricks> o/
07:58 <@minus> how's the weather?
07:58 <@matricks> windy :/
07:58 <@minus> :o
07:59 <@matricks> waiting for the teams decision
07:59 <@minus> no wind, blue sky here :)
07:59 <@minus> let pos_attr = "position".with_c_str(|ptr| gl::GetAttribLocation(program, ptr));
08:00 <@minus> looks weird
08:00 <@matricks> yeah, it's a bit ugly
08:00 <@matricks> I'm starting to wrap those unsafe things
08:00 <@minus> it's immediately obvious what it does though, so it's fine
08:01 <@matricks> it's done that why because the string will outlive the ptr
08:01 <@matricks> it's a bit safer then just returning the pointer to a string

09:03 <@minus> Oo
09:03 <@minus> .test.
09:03 <@minus> well, that's interesting
09:10 <@minus> -rwxr-xr-x 1 thomas thomas 1.7M May 24 09:09 test*
09:10 <@minus> nice executable size
09:10 <@minus> that's a hello world btw
09:11 < EastByte> hallo thomas
09:11 <@minus> s'if you didn't know that
09:12 < EastByte> hm is that rust?
09:12 <@minus> yeah
09:12 <@minus> building rust-git right nowâ€¦
09:12 <@minus> this is gonna take a while
09:13 <@minus> considering it cloned llvm
09:16 <@matricks> argh!
09:16 <@matricks> I don't know if I should go and try to fly or not
09:20 <@minus> one can see that Rust borrows from Python
09:20 <@minus> i like it :)
09:20 <@matricks> it borrows a lot from different languages without shame :)
09:20 <@minus> nothing wrong with that
09:21 <@minus> it could have removed the ; though
09:21 <@minus> then again that forces a specific formatting
11:13 < koomi> minus: ; has a specific meaning, it discards the return value of that expression
11:14 <@minus> koomi: i read that meanwhile
13:17 <@minus> waitwaitwait, rust does not have enums scoped?
13:17 <@minus> why would you do that?
13:29 <@minus> well, rust just took ~85 minutes to build
16:01 < Safa_[A_boy]> Hello guys. I think that the buttons are don't resize with the text in them right?
18:43 < Safa_[A_boy]> Hello guys. I think that the buttons are don't resize with the text in them right? :\

21:04 <@minus> fun
21:05 <@matricks> hehe
21:05 <@matricks> wow, such code, much security, very bobby tables
21:06 <@minus> :D
21:48 < BotoX> And, if you want to know, i'm not a newbie in programmation
