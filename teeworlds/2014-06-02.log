17:53 < Madara_> hey Guys.
17:53 < Madara_> Is the player_color_body variable just like a HTML color code?
17:59 < Dunedune> ehm yes and no
17:59 < Learath2> it is html color converted to decimal iirc
17:59 < Dunedune> it's rgb
18:00 < Dunedune> not a string though
18:00 < Learath2> then i dont remember correct :D
18:00 < fisted> rgba, IIRC
18:00 < fisted> also, hi
18:07 <@minus> rgba? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YWMGuh15nE

18:07 < Madara_> Learath2, you can also assign a HEX number to the color...
18:10 < Madara_> But if it's rgb, why isn't x000000 black?
18:10 < EastByte> it's not rgb
18:11 <@minus> if it's ARGB, 0xFF000000 is black
18:11 < EastByte> it's called hsl I think
18:11 <@minus> oh
18:11 < EastByte> once I needed to write a converting tool
18:11 <@minus> internally saved as HSL?
18:11 < EastByte> yes
18:13 < fisted> eh pretty sure internally it is RGBA (or ARGB) too
18:13 < fisted> unless it's changed in the last couple years
18:17 < EastByte> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/components/skins.cpp#L335
18:17 < EastByte> well, I'm not sure when it's internally
18:17 < EastByte> but via network it is hsl

18:53 < fisted> hm, okay
19:29 < FreakXZone> Hi :)
19:31 < FreakXZone> Dune told me to join the IRC to talk about the Teeworlds Online idea
19:34 < FreakXZone> so here i am
19:41 <@minus> well hello then
19:42 < FreakXZone> minus you are magnus?
19:43 < BotoX> So, what about that idea of yours
19:43 < BotoX> and to answer your question - is not magnus :v
19:44 <@minus> i, indeed, am not magnus
19:44 < FreakXZone> okay, well as i said in the forum teeworlds is not a game that you play casualy on your smartphone
19:44 <@minus> i am, however, watching nisemonogatari, so if you'll excuse me
19:45 < BotoX> >being this late on that show
19:45 <@minus> second run
19:46 < BotoX> oh lolwat
19:48 < FreakXZone> when playing teeworlds you have to concentrate 100% on the game. thats bad for mobile games because you play mobile games while doing others things. So you cant be concentrated on the game.
19:50 < FreakXZone> in teeworlds online you play your personal tee with equipment, experience, skills. You can start the game just to look up new letters in the mailbox or trading some items.
19:50 < BotoX> Now, who is playing teeworlds on his mobile device?
19:50 < BotoX> Anyone?
19:51 < FreakXZone> nobody, thats the point^^
19:51 < BotoX> The only version out there is pretty buggy and you can't really enjoy the game
19:52 < FreakXZone> right, thats why i want to develop some kind of teeish game you can actually enjoy on your mobile
19:52 < BotoX> Well, good luck with that, I guess.
19:53 < BotoX> I hate games on phones
19:53 < BotoX> They're stupid and you can't do a lot
19:53 < BotoX> also eating muh precious battery when I could be looking at cute drawn chinese grills
19:53 < FreakXZone> personal preference i guess
19:54 < BotoX> Teeworlds on a nintendo DS would be fun I guess
19:55 < koomi> I played teeworlds on my open pandora once
19:55 < koomi> but it was horribly laggy
19:55 <@minus> oh, you have one of those?
19:55 < koomi> yep, but I haven't used it in years
19:55 < BotoX> that thing looks pretty nerdy :D
19:56 < BotoX> huehue
19:56 < koomi> the joypads were awesome
19:57 < koomi> notaz, one of the devs, did a port of the original starcraft
19:59 < heinrich5991> wow
20:09 < Dunedune> on mobile?
20:10 < BotoX> open pandora
20:10 < EastByte> never heard about pandora? :D
