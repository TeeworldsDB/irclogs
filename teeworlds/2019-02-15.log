09:12 < day> Dune: i got dragged into a 2v2 iCTF yesterday. apparently everyone plays dyn cam now :X
09:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah day it's such a big advantage there if you can aim properly
12:27 < day> i know. instagib is like playing "tanks"
12:28 < day> btw. whats the story between the two camera modes anyways?
13:52 <@Dune> I don't know the full story, but it was mentioned that resolutions were quite smaller when Teeworlds was first designed, and having a static camera with more zoomout would show the tees too small
13:54 <@Dune> I personally think it would be nice to get a field of view upgrade for the static camera in the next major version. It really sucks when you go fast, and dynamic camera is dizzy and not noob-friendly
14:05 < rand> does the server send different data for dyn/static ? or does it only depend on the tee coordinates ?
14:24 <@Dune> no, same data
18:13 < minus> solution: kill dyncam, zoom out static cam to accomodate
18:13 <@Dune> +1 minus
18:13 < minus> disclaimer: i don't play teeworlds
18:13 <@Dune> some players would be unhappy of losing an edge though :D
18:14 <@Dune> disclaimer: I can't aim for shit with dyncam
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <＃0069> There is a lot of players that would hate losing dyncam, best idea is to make it non-default, not removing it
18:34 <@Dune> it is already not the default
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <＃0069> Let it as it is then
18:35 <@Dune> the issue remains: static camera is really really zoomed in
18:35 <@Dune> because of something outdated
18:36 <@Dune> it's not that the dyncam would be removed, but rather that improvements to static would make it pointless?
19:15 < minus> or add a third mode, zoomed out, doing what i described before
20:05 <@Dune> why would anyone use static cam then?
20:05 < minus> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
20:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <＃0069> if the static mode is zoomed out i think it should be laser-range size
