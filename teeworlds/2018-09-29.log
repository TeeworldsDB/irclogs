00:12 < breton> i ran into a weird issue with ddnet binary for linux
00:13 < breton> i've just migrated to a new computer, and all buttons get double-pressed in ddnet
00:14 < breton> for example when i press t to open chat, i already have t pre-entered. When i press backspace, 2 symbols get removed. Or when i press enter, the chat is closed and opened immediately
00:14 <@minus> you should probably address this to #ddnet
00:14 < breton> oh ok, thakns
18:40 < Blackbacky> Hello 
18:41 < Edible> HELLO
