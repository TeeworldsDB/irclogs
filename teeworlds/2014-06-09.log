00:02 < heinrich5991> BotoX: reentry guard is nothing for multithreading
00:02 < heinrich5991> it's not thread-safe anyway
00:02 < heinrich5991> it's for making sure a chat message doesn't cause another chat message
00:02 < BotoX> aha
00:03 < heinrich5991> thus recursing infinitely
00:05 < Kubi_> or i have tried to code something which returns the 2 word of your chat command. for example if you write /upgrade hammer, it would return in the next line "hammer". If someone can tell me how to, this would be enough for me :)
00:08 < heinrich5991> Kubi_: char *NextWord(char *pString) { while (*pString++) { if(*pString == ' ') return pString + 1; } return 0; }
00:11 < Kubi_> thank you! i will try :)
00:12 < heinrich5991> mh, that might be broken
00:12 < heinrich5991> should probably be a do-while loop
00:14 < Kubi_> yeah..does not work :(
00:15 < Kubi_> C2601, C2446, C2040 are the errors.

00:30 < Kubi_> heinrich: http://s14.directupload.net/images/140609/64mhgfue.png
00:36 < Learath2> Kubi_: it looks like you are getting ahead of yourself
00:38 < Kubi_> no i dont think so ^^ ok it does compile now. but no result..
00:38 < Learath2> well you didnt even check what the command is used for
00:39 < Kubi_> do you mean the str_comp_,,, thing
00:40 < Learath2> CCmd::Upgrade gets called with Msg. Msg isnt ever used. You created a char *Skillname; which is essentially a pointer to a char. You didnt assign anything to the pointer and you are essentially comparing nothing to "walkspeed"
00:41 < Kubi_> ow yes. pointers are my problems. didnt have that at school. 
00:41 < Learath2> you should try working on something a tad bit simpler then tw 
00:42 < Learath2> I did start C with tw however it was harsh and i kept asking stupid questions to heinrich fistd and GreyFox
00:43 < Kubi_> hm. yes. only "little" things are stopping my work. like pointers or so
00:44 < Learath2> well
00:44 < Kubi_> but i chose the hard(er) way. modding tw is cool ;D
00:44 < Learath2> I would start with actually processing Msg
00:45 < Kubi_> hm, but every other CCmd is with MSg
00:45 < Kubi_> why this wouldn't work with that
00:45 < Learath2> Kubi_: what file is this even ?
00:45 < Kubi_> my own created one.
00:45 < Kubi_> i think you would call this ..class?
00:46 < Learath2> and where does your file hook in to the actual tw ?
00:46 < Kubi_> src - game - server -chatcmd.cpp
00:46 < Learath2> but something has to call your file in doesnt it ?
00:47 < Kubi_> in general my chatcmds are working. only this method does not.
00:47 < Learath2> create an object from the class
00:47 < Learath2> ]call the method 
00:48 < Kubi_> you mean Upgrade(); ?
00:48 < Learath2> yep
00:48 < Kubi_> and then somewhere in the class the method?
00:49 < Kubi_> ah k
00:49 < Learath2> some of the main code HAS to call your file 
00:49 < Learath2> or your file is essentially orphan
00:50 < Kubi_> he? how it could be, if other methods do work??
00:50 < Learath2> Obv something actually calls your file
00:51 < Kubi_> yes its included somewhere. my mate did this
00:51 < Learath2> It really sounds like you took this system from someone else 
00:52 < Learath2> You really should try doing this from scratch so you actually know how TW ties together
00:53 < Learath2> anyways I must get going nothing I can help you figure out without having some real context on how this relates to tw code
00:53 < Learath2> and a tad bit too sleepy
00:53 < Kubi_> want to have a look in TV?
00:53 < Learath2> gn8 and have fun :)
00:53 < Kubi_> oke thanx for all
00:53 < Kubi_> gn8
00:54 < Learath2> really just get vanilla tw and try to see how it all works together tho ;)
00:54 < Kubi_> ehm
00:54 < Kubi_> :D my mod was made from vanilla
00:54 < Kubi_> never copied something
00:54 < Learath2> by your friend who hooked it in for you
00:54 < Learath2> so you have no idea how your code relates to teeworlds core
00:55 < Kubi_> hm yes, more or less its right
00:55 < Kubi_> *true
00:56 < Kubi_> can u maybe help me tomorrow with teamviewer?
00:57 < Learath2> i dont think that would help you
00:57 < Kubi_> so you mean, you wouldnt bring it to work?
00:57 < Learath2> ill be around tomorrow hilite me and will see what i can do :)
00:58 < Kubi_> hmm oke ! thanx for all
01:31 < Kubi_> someone even wants to help me ? hja
01:31 < fisted> Kubi_: teeworlds is not as small and simple as it looks like.
01:32 < fisted> you won't manage to do anything meaningful before you've got a reasonable understanding of C++
01:32 < Kubi_> thats right yes. i want to learn c++ from tw
01:32 < fisted> that won't work.
01:33 < Kubi_> for example, i could make a stat-system which is saved in an account :)
01:33 < Kubi_> i know very basic things^^
01:34 < fisted> so you could /not/ make such a stat system saved into an account.  you could do it once you've arrived at a reasonable level of C++ competency :)
01:35 < fisted> you'd do better reading/working through a good book on C++, or even on C
01:35 < Kubi_> sorry for my english. i mean that i already made it.
01:35 < Kubi_> visit me in tw if you want.
01:35 < fisted> can i see it?
01:35 < fisted> no, i mean the code
01:36 < Kubi_> where to post that
01:36 < fisted> teeworlds lives on github.com
01:36 < fisted> if you don't have an account there, create one
01:36 < fisted> everyone modding tw has one
01:36 < Kubi_> somewhen someone told me a page where to copy the code and give the link
01:37 < Kubi_> but oke 1 mom.
01:37 < fisted> you mean kind of a pastebin?
01:37 < Kubi_> pls dont blame on me :D its made with .ini files
01:37 < fisted> teeworlds consists of more than one file, it'd be inconvenient to pastebin it
01:37 < Kubi_> hm i dont want to post my whole code there
01:38 < fisted> why would you not want this?
01:38 < fisted> this is FOSS
01:38 < Kubi_> its a closed mod :P
01:38 < heinrich5991> I might steal the well designed codez
01:38 < Kubi_> called build :D (botox hates it haha)
01:39 < Kubi_> no i dont want to be bullied for the bad code haha thats why xD
01:39 < fisted> Kubi_: so you're trying to mod garbage, okay.  won't make things easier for sure
01:39 < fisted> well post whatever /you/ wrote then
01:39 < fisted> paste*
01:39 < Kubi_> 1 mom
01:43 < Kubi_> http://collabedit.com/2jbny
01:43 < Kubi_> (didnt want to install that github thing)
01:44 < fisted> you will need to become familiar with a version control system, there's no way around it
01:44 < fisted> in TW's case, that is git.
01:44 < heinrich5991> there is a way around it
01:44 < heinrich5991> I avoided it for a long time :)
01:44 < fisted> there's no practical way around it
01:45 < heinrich5991> see linus
01:45 < fisted> linus /wrote/ git
01:45 < fisted> he saw there's no practical way around it
01:45 < heinrich5991> linux managed the kernel without git before git
01:45 < heinrich5991> before bitkeeper that is
01:45 < fisted> and was it a good way to do it?  if so, why did they opt for version control?
01:46 < Kubi_> soo what do you think of my code
01:46 < Kubi_> very noobish :D
01:47 < heinrich5991> checking the return vallue of sscanf
01:47 < heinrich5991> +1
01:47 < fisted> Kubi_: it's pretty gross, yes
01:47 < fisted> Kubi_: const pString;
01:47 < fisted> what is the type of pString?
01:47 < fisted> (i wasn't even aware that is legal in C++, actually)
01:47 < heinrich5991> fixed buffer sizes not advertised to sscanf
01:48 < heinrich5991> -1
01:48 < Kubi_> ehm the pstring thing was a test.
01:48 < Kubi_> never mind it please.
01:49 < Kubi_> heinrich & fisted you can edit it if you want. everyone can see it in real life i think
01:51 < fisted> Kubi_: honestly i can barely read that code
01:51 < fisted> it's gross
01:52 < Kubi_> can u give me general tips?
01:52 < fisted> please try smaller projects before you're somewhat familiar with the language
01:52 < fisted> yes.  you could start with proper indentation
01:52 < fisted> then you could avoid anything non-english in your code (or else you won't be taken for serious by most people)
01:53 < fisted> then you could try to identify code duplication and extract it into separate functions
01:53 < fisted> and so on
01:53 < Kubi_> that was because i dont plan this to publish
01:53 < fisted> tl;dr: you could try and learn C++
01:53 < fisted> even code you won't publish would benefit from most those advices
01:54 < Kubi_> this is true
01:55 < fisted> plus it looks exploitable to me
01:55 < Kubi_> does this mean it can be better ?
01:56 < Kubi_> (sorry ...my english skills..)
01:56 < Kubi_> heinrich what do you meant to my code
01:57 < fisted> Kubi_: it means it would be hard to make it worse
01:57 < Kubi_> shit
01:58 < fisted> that is the usual result of approaching too big a problem
01:58 < Kubi_> but it works fine haha :D
01:58 < fisted> stop assuming that programming doesn't require learning
01:58 < fisted> literally every skill requires some learning, programming is not an exception
01:58 < fisted> Kubi_: no it does not work fine
01:58 < fisted> Kubi_: i could pwn the shit out of that code
01:58 < Kubi_> haha ffor example
01:59 < Kubi_> would be interesting for me
01:59 < fisted> Kubi_: is there a server running that code?
02:00 < Kubi_> yes hahha :D 
02:00 < fisted> where?
02:01 < Kubi_> personal comptuer
02:01 < fisted> IP?
02:01 < Kubi_> no flooding :D
02:01 < Kubi_> :PP
02:02 < fisted> stop being retarded
02:02 < fisted> i want to see your account system in action
02:02 < Kubi_> write in teeworlds kubi
02:02 < Kubi_> you will find me
02:03 < fisted> there you go
02:03 < Kubi_> what did you do :D
02:03 < Kubi_> buffer overflow?
02:03 < BotoX> >32 char username or pw I guess
02:04 < Kubi_> and u typed 33?
02:04 < Kubi_> or so
02:04 < fisted> yeah, if you only fix that, your "code" will magically become great and well-conceived
02:04 < fisted> no more need to learn c++
02:04 < Kubi_> this was ironic?
02:05 < Kubi_> ._.
02:05 < botnik> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=._.
02:07 < Kubi_> but its working^^ no one have 32+ chars
02:08 < fisted> you don't even seem to realize the impact of what you wrote there
02:08 < Kubi_> ehm more or less. if this would be a commercial thing or so, it wouldnt be that good yes
02:08 < fisted> it's trivial to crash, and with slightly more effort (still easy) it's a textbook remote-code-execution vulnerability
02:09 < fisted> with a /lot/ of room for shellcode
02:10 < fisted> so what your code does is opening the gate for someone to go take over your machine.
02:10 < Kubi_> taking over? dont overdo it :D
02:10 < fisted> i am not overdoing anything
02:11 < fisted> how long a message does tw allow? 500-ish characters?
02:11 < Kubi_> which opportunity does my code allow? ehm i dont knwo srry
02:12 < fisted> your code allows me to go and take control of the computer on which it runs, with little effort
02:12 < Kubi_> be concrete pls. sounds very interesting
02:13 < Kubi_> taking over my pc because of my chat lol
02:13 < fisted> that's what typically happens when people are writing code when they rather ought to be learning how to program
02:14 < fisted> Kubi_: if you're interested in the matter, read up on common techniques to exploit buffer overflows
02:14 < fisted> sometimes called stack smashing
02:15 < BotoX> >with little effort
02:15 < BotoX> well, I wouldn't say that
02:15 < Kubi_> ahh. looks conversant to me
02:16 < Kubi_> in League of Legends, a friends friend did that technique there
02:17 < fisted> BotoX: what needs substantial effort?
02:17 < BotoX> dropping a shell I guess?
02:17 < Kubi_> The field where u could write your Phone number (for banking), you had to wirte more digits than normal phone numbers have. then u got added premium points
02:18 < BotoX> actually take control of it
02:18 < fisted> and why is that?  Windows NT 6.1 /64bit shellcode doesn't sound like hard to dig up
02:19 < fisted> there's enough space to put 10 payloads, which even allows for a bit uncertainity about the address to jump to (see NOP sled)
02:19 < BotoX> can you recover the teeworlds process and drop a shell which connects to you, with "little effort"
02:21 < fisted> one could probably fit a botnet bootstrap into 460 bytes ;)
02:21 < fisted> as for how difficult getting a "shell" on windows is, i'm not too sure
02:22 < Kubi_> (remembering how this discussion started with...my "creepy" tw mod :( )
02:24 < Kubi_> anyone know how to code with XNA?
02:25 < BotoX> I guess you don't even need to recover the process
02:25 < BotoX> open shell and make connection to some server
02:27 < Kubi_>  my IT-teacher told me to use XNA for my school project. because i dont wanted to work (again) with draw picture method hahahha :D
02:27 < fisted> > teachers recommending proprietary stuff
02:27 < fisted> > armes deutschland
02:27 < BotoX> haha
02:29 < Kubi_> xna is allowed for private stuff i think :D
02:29 < fisted> whether or not it is allowed wasn't my point
02:30 < Kubi_> ="geheim" / "geschützt"
02:30 < BotoX> fisted, you don't happen to know a local root exploit for freebsd 8.0 which is not http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/Nov/371
02:31 < fisted> no, i don't know one
02:31 < fisted> if i knew one i'd dump it on their mailing list ;)
02:32 < fisted> why ask?
02:32 < BotoX> would be very helpfull right now, to have root access on this thing, need to copy a bunch of servers where the ssh key is on this one
02:32 < Kubi_> he said i could use xna because it can make real "animated" games. how ever. 
02:34 < fisted> BotoX: and it is legitimately yours?
02:34 < BotoX> no, obviously not.
02:34 < BotoX> it's a project which is getting shut off soon
02:34 < BotoX> and a bunch of people tries to get all the data before they close
02:34 < BotoX> mangatraders
02:34  * fisted facpalms
02:35 < fisted> i hope all the mangas get lost
02:35 < BotoX> hehe
02:37 < Kubi_> fisted what did u mean with proprietary stuff
02:38 < fisted> Kubi_: software which isn't http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS
02:38 < Kubi_> why it has to be FOSS to be good?
02:38 < fisted> and usually attempts some sort of vendor lock-in
02:39 < Kubi_> ah explains every thing
02:39 < fisted> FOSS doesn't necessarily imply 'good', however proprietary software exists mainly to make money with
02:39 < fisted> see how you are supposed to buy a new version of windows every other year
02:40 < fisted> while there is technically little reason to do so;  the fundamentals of our computing having changed significantly in the last decades
02:40 < Kubi_> didnt know that. he only said i should use it
02:40 < Kubi_> fisted how old are you. your english is very well
02:41 < Kubi_> or you use some special rare word generator which people normally never know
02:42 < fisted> lol
02:42 < fisted> for instance? :)
02:42 < Kubi_> yeah really
02:42 < Kubi_> ehm
02:42 < fisted> what words didn't you understand?
02:43 < Kubi_> mom i was looking. ehm proprietary for example. i had to transate it
02:43 < Kubi_> *translate
02:43 < fisted> it translates to Proprietaer... ;)
02:43 < fisted> but yeah it's not the most commonly known word
02:43 < BotoX> Arbeit macht frei
02:43 < Kubi_> hahaha
02:43 < Kubi_> :D
02:43 < Kubi_> in german i never heard of it too
02:44 < Kubi_> do we have some kind of  einstein. only in linguistic talent and IT ? xd
02:45 < Kubi_> *only with ling...
02:45 < fisted> you really only notice proprietary software once you're outside proprietary IT world
02:45 < fisted> it's kind of as if you'd been unplugged from the matrix ;)
02:48 < Kubi_> first i have to be plugged into a duden to understand these words. then maybe i could exit your matrix
02:48 < Kubi_> tell me how old -(Messlatte)- :D
02:48 < fisted> proprietary = belonging to someone, to put it very bluntly
02:49 < Kubi_> yes i know. how i told i googled it before
02:49 < Kubi_> :P
02:49 < fisted> but the remaining words of my two messages were easy :)
02:50 < Kubi_> ^^
02:50 < Kubi_> how ever#
02:50 < Kubi_> answer my question pls :D wont harm you - i think - :D
02:51 < fisted> sigh
02:51 < fisted> i'm 28
02:51 < fisted> probably twice your age
02:51 < fisted> :P
02:52 < BotoX> hopefully
02:53 < Kubi_> im not 14 :P
02:53 < Kubi_> but it was near to that age yes
02:54 < fisted> well you must at least be 10 seeing that you have mastered division of numbers :)
02:54 < Kubi_> agree :D
02:54 < BotoX> If he was brave enough to give away his age after you asked him, you might aswell do so too.
02:54 < Kubi_> i have to be the same age like botox ^^
02:54 < BotoX> pls no
02:55 < fisted> :D
02:55 < Kubi_> sry botox but i dont have "instant think - type - (correct) and answer skills" :D
02:55 < BotoX> aha.
02:55 < Kubi_> i am 17 :D
02:56 < BotoX> Oh dear. I am too.
02:56 < Kubi_> how i told :D
02:56 < Kubi_> i know you hehe ^^
02:57 < Kubi_> pedo action :D
02:57  * BotoX hides
02:57 < Kubi_> free rape :D
02:57  * fisted stares 
02:57 < Kubi_> i will rape your codes :D
02:57 < Kubi_> hahahah
02:58 < fisted> since you're refusing to learn C++, i'm confident that won't happen :)
02:58 < BotoX> le master trolle :^)
02:58 < Kubi_> i've never refused it
02:59 < BotoX> http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~pmg/tutorials/tmp/cppkursunimarburg/
02:59 < fisted> you're implicitly refusing it by trying to mod tw instead of learning C++
02:59 < BotoX> That's how I began, pretty much.
02:59 < Kubi_> you sent me that (thanks again)
03:00 < Kubi_> fisted: i was starting modding tw to get a  picture again
03:00 < Kubi_> ups.
03:01 < Kubi_> erase that again xd
03:01  * BotoX ♫ nervous_testpilot ♫ Frozen Synapse Red #02 ♫ nervous_testpilot ♫ My Beautiful Escape [1:30/5:55]
03:02 < BotoX> this song is really nice
03:02 < Kubi_> *to get a "picture" of c++. 
03:02 < fisted> Kubi_: c++ is such complicated a language that that approach is doomed to fail, is what i'm trying to convey the whole time :)
03:03 < fisted> i think the problem is that TW looks so simple :)
03:04 < fisted> it's not.  it's a chunk of >50.000 lines of code
03:04 < Kubi_> i know, you told me that too, even before i posted my code
03:04 < Kubi_> no lol. tw killed me nearly as i saw it the first time.
03:04 < Kubi_> 1. because i was only scripting with AutoIT at that time
03:05 < Kubi_> 2. because i never coded such complicated things.
03:05 < Kubi_> but we are learning c# at school. it is helping me a lot
03:05 < fisted> but throwing yourself unprepared at such complicated things is not going to make you learn coding such complicated things
03:06 < fisted> C# is a toy compared with C++
03:06 < Kubi_> c# and c++ have numerous similarities.
03:06 < BotoX> in the syntax maybe
03:06 < fisted> not even that, really
03:07 < fisted> c# and java are the "similar" languages
03:07 < fisted> the similarity in C# and C++ is that both have a C in the name
03:07 < fisted> which is obviously a marketing trick
03:07 < BotoX> yeah, true
03:07 < BotoX> the real name is MS Java
03:07 < fisted> heh indeed
03:07 < fisted> MS Java.NET
03:08 < fisted> such fancy proprietary technologies
03:08 < fisted> it's good we have 'em
03:08 < BotoX> lol
03:08 < Kubi_> lol ms java
03:08 < Kubi_> i mean the really basic things like creating methods or so
03:09 < Kubi_> dont know in what "level" you thought about
03:09 < BotoX> their server is so slow that analyzing data on it is slower than packing it, downloading it to mine, unpack it and load it into MariaDB is faster
03:10 < fisted> well in C++ you have methods, virtual methods, static methods, polymorphic methods, protected methods, private methods, public methods, friend methods, uhm..
03:10 < fisted> anything i missed?
03:10 < fisted> --> not basic in C++
03:11 < BotoX> overloaded methods, templates?
03:11 < BotoX> templates really are a nice thing though
03:11 < Kubi_> i was raped
03:11 < Kubi_> * i got raped
03:12 < fisted> BotoX: haha yeah especially when you're profiling :D
03:12 < Kubi_> in c# you have virtual, private methods too
03:12 < fisted> lemme dig up an image i mage yesterday
03:12 < fisted> http://penenen.de/fagbnc.png
03:13 < Kubi_> the fck is taht
03:13 < BotoX> all this std:
03:13 < BotoX> holy fuck
03:14 < BotoX> I see you're making an IRC bouncer?
03:14 < Kubi_> "sexuell transmitted disease" xD
03:14 < fisted> BotoX: "jein"
03:14 < Kubi_> :P
03:14 < BotoX> teeworlds bouncer? :O
03:15 < fisted> it's reminiscent of a BNC but it has a different purpose (and i've "finished" it years ago, anyway)
03:15 < fisted> the problem is my ISP dropping my connection every 12h
03:16 < fisted> fagbnc is between client and server, and handles the disconnect kind-of gracefully, while pretending to the client nothing ever happened, sort of
03:16 < BotoX> Ah, I see, nice.
03:16 < Kubi_> fisted you work in an IT company. i bet 10000€
03:16 < BotoX> inb4 he is a neet
03:17 < fisted> Kubi_: i'm a heavily underpaid sysadmin (of a sweet unix/linux-only network though :P)
03:17 < fisted> it's not a company, but a university
03:17 < fisted> so you owe me 10000 EUR
03:17 < fisted> i accept bit- and dogecoin
03:17 < BotoX> >dogecoin
03:18 < BotoX> though, shit the diff is high on that 
03:18 < Kubi_> "underpaid" is relative. but you have to know :) with that amount of skill you have good chances to be overtaken by a big one?
03:18 < BotoX> I remember when I was mining litecoin with captured servers, stopped after the difficulty hit 400
03:19 < fisted> BotoX: how much did it turn up?
03:19 < BotoX> like 1 LTC
03:19 < BotoX> sold it for $20
03:19 < fisted> oh, mh.  well better than nothing i suppose
03:19 < BotoX> to pay my actual server :P
03:19 < BotoX> which is pretty sweet since I know a guy running a big cluster.
03:19 < Kubi_> does this things have future
03:20  * fisted got sixty-five 6-core machines at work recently
03:20 < fisted> should start a mining operation, too ;D
03:20 < fisted> enabled by dsh(1) ;D
03:20 < Kubi_> i think they were "overspeculated" at the beginning
03:20 < BotoX> well, cpu mining isn't really great
03:20 < fisted> yeah, i know
03:20 < BotoX> I was mining with a few E5s
03:20 < Kubi_> GPCPU ftw
03:21 < fisted> Kubi_: all CPUs are general purpose
03:21 < fisted> well, that  might be a bit of an overstatement
03:21 < fisted> but you mean GPGPU, anyway
03:21 < Kubi_> yes
03:22 < Kubi_> am i right?
03:22 < fisted> that GPGPU ftw?  no
03:22 < BotoX> Not really
03:22 < Kubi_> paralized work
03:22 < fisted> nowadays the kewl kids mine on ASIC, where possible
03:22 < BotoX> You said, "for the win", so you want ASICs
03:22 < BotoX> GPUs will not let you win, not anymore
03:23 < Kubi_> please dont overstrain my english lol
03:23 < fisted> if you know GPGPU you might as well know ASIC ;)
03:23 < fisted> it's one less letter, even
03:24 < BotoX> Application specific integrated circuit
03:24 < Kubi_> for example cuda i think
03:24 < BotoX> made for exactly one thing.
03:24 < BotoX> a lot more efficient than other circuits
03:24 < BotoX> which are general purpose
03:25 < Kubi_> specialized for 1 thing but cant do other things well?
03:25 < BotoX> they can only do that one thing
03:25 < BotoX> well, most of the time they do multiple small things
03:25 < Kubi_> and why is it bad for mining
03:25 < BotoX> huh?
03:26 < Kubi_> you said gpgpu + ftw = no :D
03:26 < BotoX> because you won't really be winning
03:26 < BotoX> since it's not efficient enough
03:26 < BotoX> to make proffit
03:26 < BotoX> when you pay for the GPU and power
03:27 < BotoX> since there are people mining with ASICs and increasing the difficulty
03:27 < Kubi_> so what will perform well?
03:27 < fisted> A S I C s
03:29 < Kubi_> hm ok. now i am a bit smarter
03:29 < Kubi_> interesting topic
03:29 < BotoX> The problem is though, that general purpose processors are mass produced
03:30 < BotoX> and therefor cheap
03:30 < BotoX> but ASICs, have to be engineered for one task and that's expensive when the market isn't big
03:30 < BotoX> it also takes a while
03:30 < BotoX> and obviously the people who produce them will rape the coin first
03:30 < BotoX> and then sell it
03:31 < fisted> but...couldn't you simply get into ASIC programming by modding a couple affordable ASICs?
03:31 < fisted> :)
03:31 < BotoX> ASIC != FPGA
03:31 < fisted> an ASIC might well be implemented as an FPGA
03:31 < BotoX> And I don't think they release the code for their ASICs
03:32 < BotoX> FPGAs aren't really that efficient
03:32 < BotoX> not for mining
03:32 < Kubi_> but isnt that true that these coin things have been to overspeculated at the beginning
03:32 < BotoX> eh, rather under
03:32 < Kubi_> (="spekulationsblase")
03:32 < BotoX> the chinese were buying them like crazy
03:32 < BotoX> and building datacenters to mine them
03:32 < BotoX> then the government banned it
03:32 < Kubi_> but they dont have any real values
03:33 < fisted> Kubi_: does your pape rmoney have any real/intrinsic value?
03:33 < BotoX> printed paper doesn't too
03:33 < BotoX> ^
03:33 < Kubi_> yes it has
03:33 < BotoX> lol
03:34 < Kubi_> the printed money does "represent" how much gold actually the country has
03:34 < fisted> gold?
03:34 < Kubi_> yep
03:34 < BotoX> what
03:34 < BotoX> the fuck
03:35 < fisted> so whenever money is printed, additional gold reserves were aquired?
03:36 < Kubi_> the more money is printed. the more value did gold loose. 
03:36 < fisted> that is called inflation and is not gold-specific
03:36 < Kubi_> if i remember true
03:36 < Kubi_> *right
03:37 < fisted> and it totally does not imply the paper in your wallet had any intrinsic value (other than the cost of paper and ink on it)
03:38 < fisted> (which is why it does not matter if you have it as cash or as a number in a bank computer)
03:38 < fisted> likewise for bitcoin.  it's even wrong to say that a bitcoin has no intrinsic value, because there is no bitcoin in the first place
03:38 < Kubi_> then in your oppinion the value is the global accept 
03:39 < BotoX> food has value
03:39 < BotoX> paper does not
03:39 < BotoX> at least not to humans
03:39 < BotoX> land has value
03:39 < fisted> paper can be used to make fire which can be used to make food :P
03:39 < BotoX> pfffffffffffffffft
03:40 < Kubi_> then money is only a (zwischending)
03:40 < Kubi_> :D
03:41 < Kubi_> i think the money "says" that you had changed something with real value (work, food...)
03:41 < BotoX> money gets printed
03:41 < Kubi_> and the money "saves" your work in paper
03:41 < BotoX> by the central bank
03:41 < BotoX> and everything is regulated by the world bank
03:41 < Kubi_> money is there because if you want to go shopping, you dont have to repair there something or so.
03:41 < BotoX> thus, one could say that the world bank owns everything
03:42 < BotoX> since they can just create unlimited money and buy everything
03:42 < fisted> Kubi_: usually you get your income transfered onto your bank account, with no paper being involved
03:42 < BotoX> and everyone
03:42 < Kubi_> Paper / digits. you know what i mean :D
03:42 < Kubi_> let us name it "money"..
03:43 < Kubi_> do you agree to my these?
03:43 < Kubi_> theory ^^
03:43 < fisted> which one
03:44 < Kubi_> lol i had only 1 xd
03:44 < Kubi_> i think the money "says" that you had changed something with real value (work, food...)
03:44 < Kubi_> and the money "saves" your work in paper
03:44 < Kubi_>  money is there because if you want to go shopping, you dont have to repair there something or so.
03:44 < fisted> i don't agree with the first one (although i might not fully understand what you mean)
03:45 < BotoX> I just murder someone and steal it instead, how about that?
03:45 < BotoX> Only need some weapons
03:45 < BotoX> and I can get pretty much everything
03:45 < fisted> it's even easier
03:45 < Kubi_> 1.
03:45 < fisted> say my parents are rich
03:45 < fisted> i'd get everything w/o doing anything
03:45 < Kubi_> 1. get a credit
03:45 < Kubi_> 2. buy panzer
03:46 < Kubi_> this will work
03:46 < BotoX> 3. destroy bank
03:46 < BotoX> 4. don't have to pay back credit
03:46 < Kubi_> no need for this
03:46 < BotoX> 5. ?????
03:46 < BotoX> 6. profit
03:46 < Kubi_> :P
03:47 < fisted> profit plus a nice tank to drive around, heh
03:47 < BotoX> need some fuel too
03:47 < BotoX> to drive around :p
03:47 < fisted> well.. you have a tank:)
03:47 < fisted> just "visit" the gas station
03:47 < BotoX> hehe
03:48 < Kubi_> fisted: i mean, the money you own is the evidence that u changed the money with something with a real value like work or a thing 
03:48 < Kubi_> i think i can explain it physically haha 
03:48 < BotoX> you can also cheat
03:49 < BotoX> and let other people work for you
03:49 < BotoX> how did bill gates get so rich?
03:49 < BotoX> did he really work that much?
03:49 < Kubi_> because he worked for microschrott^^ and not appel
03:49 < fisted> dude, copypasting QDOS was quite a big thing
03:49 < fisted> :)
03:49 < Kubi_> *apple
03:50 < Kubi_> because you cant save energy as it is, you have to convert it. and converted form is mone
03:50 < BotoX> physics 101
03:50 < BotoX> energy -> money conversion
03:50 < Kubi_> because you cant use money as it is (eat or drive with money ^°) you have to convert it to a real thing
03:51 < fisted> so you kind of agree it has no intrinsic value:)
03:51 < fisted> it's just there because it's universally accepted (well, within limits) as a means of trade
03:51 < Kubi_> yes it has not 
03:51 < fisted> the same could be true for bitcoin
03:51 < Kubi_> am i right?
03:51 < fisted> which would have the nice side effect of getting rid of banks
03:52 < BotoX> and having to wait half an hour for your transaction
03:52 < Kubi_> decentralization
03:52 < BotoX> also everyone knows about every transaction
03:52 < BotoX> that shit is gonna slow down sooooooo fast
03:52 < BotoX> if it were to ever reach an actual userbase
03:53 < Kubi_> decentralization. like democracy in germany
03:53 < BotoX> and the wallet would grow into the terabytes
03:53 < Kubi_> hahahah
03:53 < Kubi_> :D
03:53 < fisted> uhm, i don't see why it would get slow
03:53 < fisted> s/wallet/block chain/?
03:53 < Kubi_> if you ever have that time (/performance)
03:53 < BotoX> yeah, the block chain
03:54 < fisted> i think there are proposals how to prune the block chain if it grows too large
03:54 < BotoX> I know there are online wallets and block chain APIs
03:54 < fisted> plus the end user doesn't /really/ need the whole thing anyway
03:54 < BotoX> yeah, just freeze it, would be an option
03:54 < BotoX> every month or so
03:55 < Kubi_> the coin story will end in a few yearrs
03:55 < BotoX> probably not
03:55 < BotoX> people have started adopting it
03:55 < Kubi_> because nobody has a use of it
03:55 < BotoX> it won't just suddenly die
03:56 < BotoX> there actually is a big market for it
03:56 < Kubi_> "calculating some shitty codes"
03:56 < Kubi_> i mean they dont make something like folding@home or so
03:57 < Kubi_> they make useless things
03:57 < BotoX> yeah, true
03:57 < BotoX> so much wasted power :(
03:57 < Kubi_> there is no transfere to a real value
03:57 < fisted> the question is whether the "wasted" power is more than the power banks and their datacenters consume
03:57 < BotoX> probably a NSA botnet to crack password hashes
03:57 < Kubi_> a german did install a coin farm inn his basement
03:57 < Kubi_> pro: bitcoins and heat
03:57 < Kubi_> :)
03:58 < Kubi_> he didnt have heizung hahah
03:58 < BotoX> A friend of mine has 600 bitcoins
03:58 < Kubi_> sell sell sell
03:58 < Kubi_> buy panzer
03:58 < fisted> baww, still has?
03:58 < fisted> sucks to be him
03:58 < BotoX> finanzamt is watching him
03:59 < Kubi_> als ob xD
03:59 < BotoX> I'm sure he sold a bunch of it
03:59 < Kubi_> that finanzamt action
04:00 < Kubi_> hurnshne. they are everywhere were they are money
04:00 < fisted> they are the /finanz/amt, duh
04:00 < Kubi_> *where money is
04:00 < fisted> ;)
04:01 < fisted> brb
04:01 < Kubi_> bb sanx
04:01 < Kubi_> finanzamt lobby xD
04:02 < Kubi_> politicsa are made by the lobbiests
04:05 < Kubi_> bb botox
15:39 < BotoX> wellp https://boards.4chan.org/a/thread/108577266/mangatraders-hacked
15:42 < EastByte> guess who's the badboy
15:43 < EastByte> oh they have your nick
15:44 < BotoX> it's not only me btw
15:44 < BotoX> not that it actually matters, an admin joined the archival channel and is willing to co-operate with the archivers
15:44 < EastByte> eh
15:45 < BotoX> the site was going down in a few days
15:45 < BotoX> then somebody donated 2.7 bitcoins
15:45 < BotoX> and kept it alive for another month or two
16:09 < fisted> wow wtf
16:09 < fisted> so you just ... happened to find a freebsd local root exploit?
16:10 < masoudd> Is there such a thing? 
16:10 < EastByte> He didn't
16:10 < fisted> well he asked for one yesterday
16:11 < EastByte> ah
16:11 < masoudd> just change the init to bash. bam you have root
16:11 < fisted> >implying there's bash on freebsd
16:11 < fisted> you'd cause a panic() bro ;)
16:11 < masoudd> What ever. there's all sorts of thing you can do locally. 
16:12 < masoudd> before booting I meant
16:12 < fisted> oh eh
16:12 < fisted> i presume by local he meant having a user account on the box
16:12 < fisted> not physical access
16:12 < fisted> but not sure
16:16 < masoudd> Now that would be impressive
17:23 < BotoX> had a reverse shell through a broken PHP script
17:25 < masoudd> Ahh good ol' PHP
17:25 < masoudd> And I suppose the PHP was running as root
18:04 < fisted> oh well
18:07 < fisted> i should get a freebsd box going again
18:07 < fisted> kinda been sucked into netbsd lately
18:38 < Edible> netbsd is useless
18:38 < Edible> trolololo
18:38 < Edible> fisted, why would you use netbsd, do you have some weird arquitecture?
18:44 < fisted> Edible: no, i just like the clean design
18:44 < fisted> (and i'm admin of a handful netbsd servers, which was what made me appreciate it)
18:45 < Edible> compared to freebsd whats the clean design?
18:45 < Edible> where does it differ?
18:45 < Edible> i do like the idea of pkgsrc instead of ports
18:46 < Edible> ports is just a bad idea, especially when you try to add patches
18:46 < fisted> freebsd is very well-designed, too, i don't think the difference is that large (though there's more emphasis on performance there)
18:46 < fisted> hm, yeah pkgsrc is great :)
18:46 < fisted> freebsd ports didn't cause me any major trouble either, though
18:47 < Edible> you can build from source, but can you add patches to anything without them getting destroyed on the ⏩ version?
18:47 < fisted> what do you mean 'destroyed on the version'?
18:53 < Edible> mm dont remember clearly but i think when an update to a port came it destroyed personal modifications (patches) and so on
19:06 < Edible> ⏩ that means ne xt
19:10 < fisted> i seem to lack the glyph, looks like whitespace
19:13 < Inedible> its basically the ne xt icon on media players
19:17 < fisted> and your client auto transforms literal 'n e x t' to that symbol?
19:19 < Inedible> yep
19:19 < Inedible> i think ill add more symbols
19:21 < Inedible> i kind of like it, easier reading i think. the ⌨ cant have everything
19:21 < fisted> whatever that char was, meh
19:21 < Inedible> copy paste it in browser
19:21 < fisted> i haven't heard of such a dumb irc client feature in a while, frankly
19:23 < Inedible> oh question mark you like text question mark How do you like this sentence then question mark
19:24 < fisted> question marks aren't preceeded by whitespace
19:24 < fisted> also, are you like 14?
19:25 < Inedible> they indeed arent, but it is still a word
19:25 < fisted> so what?
19:25 < Inedible> alright then
19:25 < Inedible> ohquestionmark you like textquestionmark How do you like this sentence thenquestionmark
19:25 < Inedible> is that better?
19:25 < Inedible> more readable?
19:25 < fisted> it's not a syntactically correct sentence
19:26 < Inedible> nope
19:28 < fisted> you're ignorant in assuming everyone would a) consider symbols easier to read then word, on a text medium (must be the result of user interfaces getting dumbed down a lot nowadays)
19:28 < fisted> and b) that everyone would even have the glyphs you fancy
19:28 < fisted> last but not least it gives away your general age.
19:31 < Inedible> Here fisted, take your ☂
19:32  * fisted takes his missing-glyph-char
19:32  * fisted mutters something about retards
19:32 < Inedible> be careful with the ☢ waste though, wouldnt want you to catch anything
19:41 < Inedible> these arent just symbols, they have meaning, you look at an object and you immediately know what it is, difficult to read is going with <3 instead of ♥. its much easier to read the symbol than going "hmm i wonder what those 2 characters mean?" it is particularly terse this day and age to go X O and stuff when a symbol could deliver the same meaning
19:42 < fisted> i see how this seems preferrable to someone who has difficulties at reading
19:42 < fisted> most people don't, though
19:43 < fisted> furthermore you're assuming that your symbols would be even displayed correctly everywhere, as i pointed out a couple times now
19:44 < fisted> you're either too young or too stupid to realize that symbols do /not/ have universal meanings
19:44 < fisted> it's highly context and reader dependent
19:44 < Inedible> That doesnt matter, utf8 exist, it is a standard, fonts that dont support all of it should be tossed away or updated, 
19:46 < Inedible> You're going with the "well my ASCII terminal cant display these symbols. This is a terrible idea that will never get picked up"
19:46 < fisted> it's infeasible to have "all" glyphs, especially in the light of new glyphs being added, and limited resources being available.
19:46 < fisted> furthermore a "complete" set of glyphs is quite large
19:49 < Inedible> they do, even more so because it isnt tied to one language, symbols dont need to be translated. they exist, everyone knows how a gun looks like, and so on for the majority of them.
19:50 < fisted> aha
19:50 < fisted> clearly you have a lot of experience there
19:51 < fisted> what's the meaning of the swastika?
19:51 < fisted> (there's a unicode glyph for it)
19:52 < Inedible> the meaning depends on context
19:52 < fisted> 19:44:12 <    fisted > it's highly context and reader dependent
19:53 < fisted> so how are symbols universally understood again?
19:56 < Inedible> everything requires context, what are you trying to say here?
19:57 < fisted> symbols provide an additional layer of indirection
19:57 < fisted> it's sad that you don't even see the implications of your own claims.
19:58 < Inedible> what is indirection?
19:59 < fisted> in this case, when the meaning is conveyed by proxy rather than explicitly stated in the normal format of the medium (text)
20:04 < Inedible> i guess i give up, i really dont understand what you mean there
20:04 < fisted> whatever
20:04 < fisted> you'll grow up eventually, and quakenet is dying anyway, fortunately :)
20:05 < Inedible> why do you want quakenet to die? dont you like irc?
20:05 < fisted> i like IRC a lot
20:06 < fisted> quakenet is largely uninteresting and full of kids, though
20:07 < Inedible> ah alright. sounds like the place for me then :)
20:07 < fisted> enjoy it while it's still here :)
20:10 < Inedible> pedophilia ftw!
20:11 < Inedible> anyway, you did give me an idea about the whole thing. the glyphs should only be used for nouns, no adjectives
20:13 < fisted> it's against the spirit of IRC
20:13 < fisted> you can spam the AOL chat with those unicode symbols
20:13 < fisted> on IRC people tend to be more sensible and avoid nonstandard encoding where possible
20:14 < Learath2> I had to change 4 fonts to find one that actually includes all your symbols and looks decent
20:14 < fisted> (note that ascii(-ish) is the standard encoding for IRC)
20:14 < Inedible> Learath2, welcome to my world :)
20:14 < Inedible> its utf8, should be supported everywhere by now. i mean, its only 20 years old
20:15 < Learath2> totally i mean its common sense
20:15 < Learath2> A font that is supposed to include characters whould also include every possible glyph
20:15 < koomi> doesn't mean every font has all the glyphs
20:15 < fisted> what does it matter that it "should" be supported and implemented everywhere?
20:15 < Learath2> we should make utfp16 which adds drawing support 
20:23 < Inedible> thats just... how would that even work?
20:23 < fisted> thats what people asked about unicode, too
20:23 < fisted> in 20 years there will be an equivalent-you idiot in some other IRC network using it
20:24 < fisted> and defending it how it should be supported everywhere by then
20:24 < fisted> despite it being a completely ridiculous feature :)
20:24 < Inedible> no need for name calling
20:26 < Kubi_> hello
20:26  * Kubi_ slaps Learath2 around a bit with a large fishbot
20:27 < fisted> no need for symbol usage either
20:27 < fisted> i feel insulted by it
20:29 < Inedible> you shouldnt be... wtf? how is that? wh...? the hell?
20:30 < Inedible> Learath2, support ascii and everything else gets drawn with libcaca. thats the way it should be
20:32 < fisted> you keep talking about how things "should" be
20:32 < fisted> it's entirely irrelevant how things "should" be when reality differs
20:33  * Kubi_ slaps Kubi_ around a bit with a large fishbot
20:33 < Kubi_> dafuq's that
20:37 < Inedible> fisted, as long as i keep using these symbols and nobody knows wtf i just typed and they start using a sane font, reality will change. thats how it works
20:38 < fisted> like you'd cause anyone to change their font
20:38 < Inedible> fisted, that is a terrible way of looking at things you know... "oh let's not talk about anything! the world is static, it never changes! lets not do anything about anything" sounds like a recipe for depression
20:38 < Inedible> fisted, yeah, agree on that one
20:38 < fisted> Inedible: look up on the concept of 'standards' when you find some time
20:38 < fisted> not only unicode is one, IRC is one too
20:39 < Learath2> Sane font ?
20:39 < Learath2> you say a sane font should include every single glyph known to human kind ?
20:40 < Inedible> fisted, do you know the history of json?
20:40 < Inedible> thats also a standard
20:40 < Inedible> look it up
20:40 < Learath2> You should try a online whiteboard
20:40 < Learath2> that is where you can draw stuff
20:41 < fisted> how the hell is json related now?
20:41 < Inedible> Learath2, i dont want to draw anything, i suck at drawing. i'm not an artist.
20:41 < Inedible> fisted, see the history
20:41 < fisted> can't be bothered
20:41 < fisted> as it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion
20:41 < Inedible> fisted, json is a standard, who made it a standard? nobody. the guy who made it just declared it a standard and people started using it
20:42 < fisted> then json is a de-facto standard
20:42 < fisted> what's your point?
20:43 < fisted> how is this in any way related to the concept of producing messages which are likely to be understood?
20:43 < Inedible> the word "standard" is hooplah, it means nothing. some people use stuff others dont. thats how things get adopted
20:44 < fisted> the gibbering of a child means nothing
20:44 < fisted> unlike standard, which does mean something
20:45 < fisted> (namely the result of a standardization process)
20:48 < fisted> wow in unrelated news, it just kind of became night
20:53 < Inedible> welp, i gotta do shit, it was nice. goodnight
20:55 < fisted> no symbol for shit?
20:58 < heinrich5991> there is
20:58 < heinrich5991> 'PILE OF POO'
20:59 < heinrich5991> U+1F4A9
20:59 < heinrich5991> fisted: :)
20:59 < fisted> can you produce one?  i wonder if i have that glyph ;)
21:00 < heinrich5991> it's not even in the first plane
21:00 < heinrich5991> beyond the first plane, not much symbols are supported
21:00 < heinrich5991> no idea whether that's the symbol
21:01 < heinrich5991> because it displays as 'REPLACEMENT CHARACTER' for me
21:02 < heinrich5991> uh
21:02 < heinrich5991> did you know ASCII has a 'SUBSTITUTE' character?
21:02 < fisted> eh, no, does it?
21:04 < heinrich5991> yea
21:04 < heinrich5991> U+001A
21:04 < heinrich5991> apparantly
21:04 < fisted> wait.
21:05 < heinrich5991> (newline is U+000A IIRC)
21:05 < heinrich5991> (just if you wonder)
21:06 < fisted> i thought you were talking about an ascii character
21:08 < fisted> oh well, i see
21:08 < fisted> confusing to use unicode notation for describing an ascii char
21:09 < heinrich5991> yes
21:09 < heinrich5991> but well
21:27 < Inedible> theres also a record breaker, making csv irrelevant
21:27 < Inedible> i dont even know why csv exists in the first place
21:28 < heinrich5991> because you can't input a record breaker in a normal text editor?
21:28 < heinrich5991> (in an easy way, that is)
21:31 < Inedible> exactly, just add some macros and you're set, instead of making another format
21:32 < Inedible> ini's as well, those should be irrelevant
21:45 < fisted> someone does not understand the advantage of human readable data formats here
22:50 < Inedible> fisted, its still readable, the editor can know how to deal with the chars...
22:50 < Inedible> even more so
22:51 < Inedible> that is
22:51 < Inedible> are you trolling?
22:52 < fisted> if control characters are intermixed, it is not human readable, and throwing more complexity at a text editor is not a desirable solution to the issue
22:53 < fisted> since that will have to be replicated in every text editor which should handle such files
22:53 < fisted> note that this is then equivalent to a binary format in that it defeats the universality of human-readable plaintext formants
22:55 < Inedible> yes, we wouldnt want to complicate text editors, why dont we make everything xml and not use any other formats, human readability ftw
22:56 < fisted> binary formats have some use, but wherever possible they should be avoided, yes.  pulling up XML is but a straw-man
22:57 < fisted> seeing that you talk about .ini files, i infer you're from the windows world, where concepts as clean design and modularity are not particularly widely known
22:57 < fisted> you'd do well to widen your horizon a bit
