17:57 < d-t> hello. im from yesterday, again. the server crashes after exact 2 minutes, because all bots disconnects with the reason error sending data.. the server crash because the player class is NULL and will be used although the player and character doesnt exists anymore - what to do? :|
18:01 <@minus> take your monitor and throw it out of the window
18:01 <@minus> that's the most helpful comment i can offer
18:02 < d-t> gimme a seriously answer
18:02 <@minus> but i can't
18:03 <@minus> you're pretty much on your own. but like i said yesterday, maybe looking at one of the 64-player mods helps
18:03 < d-t> its maybe because im programming 0.7, in 0.6 it works @minus:
18:08 <@minus> have you tried throwing teeworlds at a debugger?
18:10 < heinrich5991> d-t: a debugger might really help
18:11 < d-t> heinrich5991: i know
18:12 < d-t> i debugged it an it throws an error at the HandleWeapons function and tells me, that m_pPlayer is empty -> null
