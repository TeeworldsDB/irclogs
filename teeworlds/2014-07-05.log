00:22 < PsychoGod> what do you think about bullets physics ? to make that grenade could be destroyed by bullet and shotgun, bullet fire in bullet -> changes traectory, or destroyed ?
00:23 <@matricks> chaos
00:23 < PsychoGod> why not ? :D
00:24 <@matricks> it's not teeworlds, teeworlds is ordered, predictable, simple
00:24 <@matricks> minimalistic
00:26  * matricks packs his bag
00:28 < PsychoGod> sleep again ? D:
00:29 <@matricks> soon enough, have to prepare some for tomorrow
00:41 < PsychoGod> good night <3
01:05 <@matricks> PsychoGod: soon :)
11:00 < nanashi> hi why DDRace named DDRace?
11:02 < heinrich5991> it originally stood for dummy drag race
11:02 < nanashi> oh
11:03 < nanashi> I thought there was an arcade game called DDR or something.. 
11:06 < nanashi> how about teeworlds? What gives inspiration to such a game?
11:07 < nanashi> is it all matricks' idea?
11:16 < heinrich5991> no, at least teetow also worked on in initially
11:16 < heinrich5991> but I think there were even more people working on it
11:23 < teetow> didn't we go through this? =)
11:24 < teetow> me, matricks and red_com had the original idea
11:24 < teetow> and made the original game for a games studio
11:24 < teetow> which was canned
11:25 < teetow> then we played around with it for a few years, until we decided to go public, and the teeworlds you guys know was born
11:25 < nanashi> nice
11:26 < nanashi> how do you know that the hookings can be so quick and fluid?
11:26 < teetow> a lot of experimentation
11:26 < nanashi> it is like a game which represents a new genre
11:36 < nanashi> btw, it seems that the routing of the internet isn't arranged evenly.
11:37 < nanashi> I get 200 ping from both China and EU, but I am in Hong Kong the southest point in China.
11:38 <@minus> didn't know you made it with the intention of getting it published
11:38 < teetow> the first time around? well, we didn't, really
11:39 < teetow> it was just a summer hack, something to do while everyone was at E3
11:39 < teetow> but the sales dude liked it, so he wanted to try and get it published
11:39 < teetow> that was our first mistake =P
11:40 <@minus> doing it because a sales guy liked it?
11:40 < teetow> getting it published
11:40 < teetow> publishers have a very narrow appreciation of "fun"
16:39 < nameless_tee46> g
16:44 <@matricks> teetow: are we talking about that now? :)
20:05 < teetow> matricks: didn't we already do that a while back?
20:05 < teetow> pretty sure I wrote some forum post or whatever when we both left the company
20:05 <@minus> i don't think so
20:05 <@matricks> no
20:17 < teetow> well, I see no point in not talking about it now
