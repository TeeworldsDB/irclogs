10:36 <@matricks> lol: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1094040691/game-ref-the-worlds-first-hardware-anti-cheat-devi
10:48 <@matricks> minus: ^^ check that
11:46 < chsk> it was fun to watch this guy's story develop on /r/csgo
11:47 <@matricks> chsk: what happend?
12:17 < chsk> o
12:18 < chsk> he was just like 'oh i got an arduino i wonder what i can do with it'
12:20 <@matricks> heh
12:20 <@matricks> anyway, I don't think that shit will work out
12:20 < chsk> but sure he'll totally get backed
12:20 <@matricks> the movie industry have been trying to solve this for decades
12:29  * eeeee kickstarts a hardware cheating arduino board
12:29 <@matricks> bad move
12:30 < eeeee> why
12:30 <@matricks> it's not going to work
12:30 < eeeee> doesn't have to work to kickstart it, duh
12:30 <@matricks> spend it on booze instead
12:31 < eeeee> was my plan exactly
12:31 <@matricks> oh.. I read your line wrong :D
12:31 <@matricks> I thought you backed the anti-cheating board :D
12:31 <@matricks> the cheating board will work wonders
12:32 < eeeee> hmm might actually make sense to invest in the anti-cheat board first, to create a market for a hardware cheat board
12:34 <@matricks> I mean, the cheating hardware is basiclly an USB-cable so :)
12:34 < eeeee> shh
12:34 < eeeee> i hear it has to be gold-plated and incrusted with diamonds to reduce latency
15:20 < minus> matricks: nice idea
15:20 <@matricks> not really
15:21 < minus> it certainly does make auto-input cheating more difficult
15:21 <@matricks> defeated by a usb cable
15:21 < minus> you mean if you already input cheated data over usb?
15:22 < minus> also it does not at all prevent ESP style hacks
15:23 <@matricks> you just feed it the modified usb data..
15:23 < minus> yep, see my first point
15:24 < minus> can't use soley software based cheats then
15:25 <@matricks> well, if they only use one cryptokey, only software is neede so
15:25 < minus> that device is by no means the perfect solution, mind you, but it makes cheating a little bit harder
15:25 <@matricks> a little bit, but circumventing it is cheaper then the actual product
15:25 < minus> that is a point, yes
15:26 < minus> well, except the time to develop means to circumvent is not gonna be cheap
15:26 < minus> if you decide to emulate the device
15:27 <@matricks> cheaper then developing the actual anti-cheat
15:28 < minus> that's the same for every anticheat though
15:28 <@matricks> yap, which is why I think it's mostly useless
15:28 < minus> if it helps keep a good percentage of cheaters out, why nor
15:28 < minus> not*
15:29 < minus> i mean, buying this thing is certainly ridiculous
15:30 < minus> the key to making it work for a decent amount of time is, like with other anti cheats, to keep as much as possible about it secret so it'll take more time to RE
15:33 < heinrich5991> that's entirely useless
15:33 < heinrich5991> -entirely
15:33 < EastByte> indeed
15:33 < heinrich5991> most cheats don't modify the input, but rather show more information
15:34 < heinrich5991> consider cs:go, just wallhacking suffices put you to a big advantage
15:34 < minus> hook graphics library, win
15:58 < chsk> minus: apparently that guy wants to opensource it
15:58 < chsk> at least it's what he's been claiming before
16:02 < EastByte> well looks like it's not going to reach its goal anyway
16:03 < chsk> of course it's not
