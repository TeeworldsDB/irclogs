01:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I see a square blue/red quad instead of the race flag :/
01:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> ok I just remembered about the "content" target, its fine now
12:18 < Dune> heyo
12:18 < Dune> it would be nice to make the 
12:18 < Dune> winter theme the new default, to give the new version a new feel
12:18 < Dune> we can even change it back to heavens or jungle if we do a spring/summer release? :)
12:19 < Dune> this would imply we need a "default" option to not annoy people who change it
12:26 < Oy> hey
12:26 < Oy> yeah, sounds good
12:58 < Dune> as sonix pointed out, we could load a secondary font for icons... we'd get all the icons and stability we want
12:58 < Dune> not sure how to trim it from unnecessary stuff
13:13 < Oy> not sure if we can handle multiple fonts right now
13:14 < Dune> probably not :/
15:31 < Oy> what's the status on the eye problem?
15:43 < Dune> good question
15:43 < Dune> different people with different opinions :D
15:44 < Dune> mine is that people should not be able to customize eyes that are not made to look good with any color (e.g. outline, only a small part is colored, etc.)
15:44 < Dune> by default, those eyes (rabbit eye etc) should have custom colors false 
15:45 < Dune> alternative solution as evoked by @Sonix and @LordSk is to do something smart by comparing the body color
16:03 < Oy> hm, ok. dunno if doing it code wise is the way to go here
16:04 < Oy> what about https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2314 ? use that toggle?
16:40 < Dune> Oy, this is a hard one too
16:40 < Dune> I personally use +toggle
16:40 < Dune> but I think that is a slightly more advanced option
16:41 < Dune> I'm ok with the Pr
16:41 < Dune> @ChillerDragon gotta fix the locale tho https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2314 
16:42 < Oy> ok, then i'll merge and do the locale string
16:42 < Dune> :+1:
16:43 < Dune> I'll pull and export strings then
16:43 < Oy> ok, any more possible strings?
16:43 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2305 does Frags -> K
16:44 < Dune> I removed the locale from K
16:44 < Dune> not sure if that is wise, gotta check how it is in scoreboard
16:44 < Dune> yeah right it was disabled there - every language uses K and D
16:44 < Dune> so it doesn't matter
16:45 < Oy> ok
16:45 < Dune> i see nothing else
16:45 < Oy> good
16:46 < Oy> will you do a news post, calling people to words? :)
16:46 < Dune> yes, this evening
16:46 < Dune> should do some dev blogs too
16:47 < Oy> would be good yeah :)
16:47 < Dune> ideally we'd target the next weekend, so people can download a bit early and get hats :)
16:48 < Oy> yeah :D
16:54 < Dune> be home on friday and then I can do things
16:55 < Dune> when do we release 0.7.4.1 :D
16:57 < Dune> Transifex updated
16:58 < Oy> hopefully everything goes correct this time :)
16:58 < Oy> good :)
16:58 < Dune> 83 strings untranslated
17:00 < Dune> nvm, 27 strings, 83 words
17:15 < Oy> how about this one https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2298 ?
17:16 < Dune> it should use the existing string right?
17:17 < Oy> yeah, just checked, there's one
17:17 < Oy> where to put it? below the timer?
17:21 < Dune> Shouldn't it be next to the score hud?
17:21 < Dune> above the score, maybe?
17:31 < Dune> redix Today at 4:30 PM 
17:31 < Dune> Oy: what about server-side stats? netmsg just for initialization or snap items?
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> test
17:38 <@heinrich5991> bridge fixed
17:39 < Dune> somewhere in the void, the IRC bot still wanders :D
17:40 <@heinrich5991> I don't get it ^^
17:41 < Dune> there was an IRC bot running on your server, but I could not get the source before it was shut down
17:42 <@heinrich5991> hummmm
17:43 < Dune> as I recall, you had added an exception for it in the bridge bot too
17:45 < Oy> netmsg would be good
17:45 < Oy> like that https://ibb.co/dkP11vj ?
17:45 < Dune> yeah, not sure how relevant the score hud is here
17:46 < Dune> > redixToday at 4:33 PM 
17:46 < Dune> i think it won't need that much bandwidth but for 64 players with the info needed for the statboard it uses ~7kb of memory per snapshot
17:46 < Dune> so more then 10% of the max snapshot size =\
17:47 < Oy> just noticed the win condition in lms is different than i thought it is
17:47 < Oy> every kill is a point
17:47 < Oy> so scorehud is useful like in dm
17:48 < Dune> isn't the win condition "kill everyone"?
17:48 < Oy> thought it was like the team survival, staying alive in a round gives u a point
17:48 < Oy> it's not
17:49 < Oy> just like dm, when u die u have to wait
17:49 < Dune> you don't get points?
17:50 < Oy> for every kill yeah
17:50 < Oy> not for staying alive?
17:50 < Dune> oh, okay
17:50 < Oy> yeah, init netmsg probably better option
17:53 < Oy> btw where does that bridge lead?
17:54 < Dune> freenode IRC and http://discord.gg/teeworlds
17:55 < Oy> ah alright
17:56 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2305 dunno how u can improve the weapon stats
17:56 < Oy> except maybe colours (green, red) but probably looks bad
18:01 < Dune> I was thinking about this a lot
18:02 < Dune> weapon stats are cryptic
18:02 < Oy> yeah
18:02 < Dune> I wanted some colored bar brown/white/brown/red/blue that shows the favorite weapons instead of those exhaustive stats
18:03 < Dune> but not sure how I would represent deaths
18:03 < Dune> ratio could have green->white->red shades
18:04 < Oy> dunno if some hardcore players need the numbers
18:04 < Dune> merge K and D columns for K/D
18:04 < Dune> meh edge cases belong to custom clients
18:04 < Oy> they probably came up with the stats in the first place :)
18:05 < Dune> yeah well that statboard is copy pasted :P
18:06 < Dune> Easiest way would be to drop deaths by weapons
18:06 < Oy> @Sonix what do u think? :)
18:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> More stats! Damage per weapon, accuracy per weapon üòÖ
18:08 < Oy> if u merge k and d, you could increase the height of the header and have the weapon and below it k/d
18:08 < Oy> ahhhh:P
18:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Just kidding üòÅ
18:09 < Dune> I mean, how would the death be displayed in this bar
18:09 < Dune> you'd need two bars?
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=ar&text=a%20axis üòõ
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but I had to look for a bit, it even seems to be x in japanese/chinese
18:13 < Dune> we don't support arabic anyway
18:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (and given that we don't support rtl languages anyway)
18:14 < Dune> yeah
18:22 < Oy> like it's now "k/d" ?
18:23 < Dune> huuh
18:24 < Dune> so =====/===== ?
18:24 < Oy> yeah
18:24 < Oy> but with the header to could understand it more easily
18:26 < Dune> not sure what the header should look like
18:33 < Oy> the weapon and below it k/d
18:36 < Dune> so it should print k/d 5 times?
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> `(and given that we don't support rtl languages anyway)` hahaha
18:37 < Dune> hmm?
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you can't understand the german asi-TV reference in it
18:42 < Oy> Dune: yeah, should test how it looks
18:43 < Dune> hammer and shotgun have the same color too :c
18:44 < Oy> rtl is a german tv channel, like the tv series little britain in real life
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> You know ger tv Oy? xd
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Dune: interested in race ghosts for gamer client?
18:47 < Dune> oh sure :) but got plenty of plans for xmas already
18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> as soon as you have migrated to 0.7.4 i'll just do a pr üòÑ
18:48 < Dune> hooo :)
18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> most stuff already works. but i'd rather contribute to some existing client than releasing my own one üôÇ
18:49 < Dune> makes sense, but other clients like chiller's will want to merge that too probably
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> shouldn't be too hard do merge üôÇ
18:50 < Dune> I guess it would be nice to merge servers too
18:50 < Dune> if you want to maintain the ddr stuff (it's not a big diff)
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> most of the code lives in it's own files üòÑ
18:50 < Dune> that's nice :D I try to do that too
18:50 < Dune> didn't manage to with gamer 
18:51 < Oy> @ChillerDragon sure, some :)
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lol
18:51 < Oy> what about that autorecord for race?
18:52 < Dune> autorecord already works globally, not sure if you want a specific settings in the vanilla client...
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> i have some code from 0.6. but it includes a lot strange text parsing and it's a game component
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> it works but it's rather ugly ^^
18:52 < Dune> sounds like that'd fit right in
18:53 < Oy> :P
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> doing the logic in the onrender method without even rendering anything is kinda odd =\
18:55 < Dune> did I mention triple arrays of callbacks? :D
18:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> and it reads the time from the filename. when you do a new record the old file is deleted
18:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> ^^
18:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> proper way would be some local db to store your best times... but that's just too much
18:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> the ghost (debug 1) is not transparent anymore üòÆ
