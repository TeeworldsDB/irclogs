00:34 < Edible> would this 's@\[@ [-\ ]\ ?@' work?
00:35 < Edible> my sed is well nonexistant
00:35 < Edible> s/well/well.../
00:50 < guest__> replace @ by / if you prefer, just more readable IMO because of \
00:51 < guest__> i dont like /\// 
10:11 < floreo> guest__: thanks for you answer, I'll try that right now :)
10:12 < floreo> guest__: you're right about the loop, totally useless
10:15 < floreo> guest__: and +1 for the separator for sed, I'm not fond of the \/ either
10:18 < floreo> guest__: though your solution doesn't work for me :(
10:18 < floreo> GNU Awk 4.0.1
10:23 < floreo> ls -l /etc/alternatives/awk
10:23 < floreo> mine is linked to mawk
10:32 <@minus> teeworlds  | awk 'match($0, /\[([0-9a-f]+)\](.*)/, a) { $1="[" strftime("%F %T", strtonum("0x" a[1])) "]" a[2]; print }'
10:38 < floreo> minus: gg and thanks, though in my case, it only works with gawk, strftime is not recognized else
10:38 <@minus> teeworlds_srv | python -uc 'for l in __import__("sys").stdin: print("["+__import__("datetime").datetime.fromtimestamp(int(l[1:9], 16)).strftime("%F %T")+l[9:].strip())'
10:39 < floreo> yes I remember your solution on the forum with python
10:40 < floreo> though I find it "less readable" but I like it :)
10:42 < floreo> minus: guest__ : may I update the gist and put your nicks to credit both of you?
10:43 <@minus> if you want to
10:45 < floreo> that's just normal :) I'll just change a few things but you gave me the good things
10:52 <@minus> i wouldn't use that python one for anything serious, because if it fails to match the timestamp it will crash
10:58 < floreo> that's right
11:00 < floreo> I think with a split in awk it would be "faster" to process than with match
11:00 < floreo> but less readable, so nvm
11:02 < floreo> to make it a "good wrapper", i'll just gonna put a check if the datetime is already in the good format (case of ddr mode not displaying the hexa timestamp)
11:07 < floreo> that's not much like that
11:07 < floreo> teeworlds-server "sv_port 8310"  | gawk '{match($0, /\[([0-9a-f]+)\](.*)/, a); if(a[1]!="")$1="[" strftime("%F %T", strtonum("0x" a[1])) "]"; $1=$1a[2]; print }'
15:32 < Dunedune> heinrich5991, minus: what's your opinion on this? http://ninslash.com/dl/tat-client.png
15:32 < Dunedune> cheat or not?
15:37 <@minus> idek what that is
15:37 < Dunedune> aim lines
15:40 <@minus> if you don't know where your cursor is you suck anyway
15:40 < heinrich5991> doesn't sound too bad for me
15:41 < Dunedune> yeah looks sort of okay
16:31 < heinrich5991> matricks: are you open for some rust questions?
16:32 <@minus> "depends, do you have beer?"
16:36 < heinrich5991> :)
20:10 <@matricks> minus: https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3SVc4QG_AzU/VAtcq5tMzYI/AAAAAAAABP8/f71l90x50FE/w1083-h610-no/DSC00491.JPG
20:10 <@matricks> :)
20:16 <@minus> \o/
20:25 < Learath2> matricks: you look like you are having fun :)
22:00 < guest__> floreo: Bibi (the french one, there are some).
22:01 < guest__> floreo: Maybe a prb with stdin. Is Ur repository update? 
22:09 <@matricks> Learath2: oh yes :D loads of funs to be had today
22:45 < floreo> guest__: ahah i'm frenchie too :p
22:45 < floreo> guest__: mm I updated the working parts, wich means output directly in the terminal
22:46 < floreo> guest__: you can pipe the output to a file, you'll see it will fail
22:47 < floreo> guest__: for ex: gawk '{match($0, /\[([0-9a-f]+)\](.*)/, a); if(a[1]!="")$1="[" strftime("%F %T", strtonum("0x" a[1])) "]"; $1=$1a[2]; print }' &>>/var/log/teeworlds/test.log < <(teeworlds-server -f test.conf) &
