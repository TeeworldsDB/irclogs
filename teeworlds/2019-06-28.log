00:12 < Dune> @jxsl13 that is very spammy on IRC, please avoid pasting large code
10:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 yea i also had lots of trouble with that. I used verbose build to see what compiler cmake picked. It is usually not the same as the one you ususally use from terminal. It is mostly some compiler located in some appl xcode directory. And there is also a own include directory which is not linked to the one from homebrew. So i just copied openssl over there. Its dirty but it works.
10:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> uff that explanation was terrible feel free to pm me and i can explain it in greater detail.
10:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But we could probably tell cmake to also search in the homebrew include dir
18:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> super weird, it somehow found it, kinda fixed some brew warnings, deleted  all headers and stuff that was not known to brew, updated all brew packages.. donno, somehow it works now.
18:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dunno*
20:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> Can anyone tell me how the doodads mapper works? It doesn't seem to work when i use it in the editor
20:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> nvmd, works, not well but works
21:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> not sure if I uploaded my half-way fixed version in the automapper PR
21:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> what are the bugs like?
21:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> at first i couldn't make the automapper run at all
21:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> fixed that by restarting, can't reproduce
21:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> now all mistakes are minor
21:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> sometimes doodads like trees cancel each other out
21:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> with a big amount its easy reproducable
21:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah, I tried to make it look a bit better but didn't go into details
21:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's quite fixeable without touching the code I think
21:32 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/tree/master/datasrc/editor/automap
21:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> if this is mearched i already use it
21:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> grass is always floating on grass map corners
21:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> mearched?
21:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> merged* ðŸ˜„
21:36 < Oy> it can probably be fixed within the rules i linked
21:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I agree
21:37 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ï¼ƒ6909> Is magnus auvinen still alive?
21:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes, he's growing a white beard on IRC
21:46 < Oy> how about adding some basic race support for the client. like showing times(instead of points), seperate race timer, localized race finish msg?
21:47 < Dune> that sounds pretty good imo
21:48 < Dune> some protocol support for race events such as start/finish/checkpoint would be neat
21:48 < Dune> and much lighter than writing a vanilla race gametype
21:49 < Oy> yeah
21:49 < Dune> heinrich5991, can you think of any race feature that could be enabled only thanks to client support?
21:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @redix ^
21:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix anything for speedracing, saved for ghosts?
22:00 < redix> The things you already mentioned are the most important stuff
22:01 < redix> Prediction for teleporters, speedups, ... would be cool but that's probably too much
22:02 < Dune> that would define a canonical way to map teleports and speedups
22:03 < redix> Instead of finish messages in chat I'd prefer to replace the killmessages with some finish display
22:04 < redix> Like in the old client pack
22:04 < redix> Especially on short maps finish messages in the chat can be very annoying 
22:10 < Oy> yeah, good idea about the reuse of killmessages

22:51 < Oy> added an issue https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2172
