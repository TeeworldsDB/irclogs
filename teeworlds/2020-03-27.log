01:19 < Learath2> How would you go about copyable text?
03:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yo Learath2 thanks a lot for looking into all these macOS issues ❤️
03:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh and could you please replace those "Fix #ISSUE" commit messages with at least 1 word describing the issue like "Fix foo (closed #ISSUE)"
09:56 < Learath2> @ChillerDragon oh yeah definitely, I was in a weird kind of headspace yesterday, wasn't really thinking while commiting :P
11:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Nice
12:10 < Dune> Learath2: I'm happy with your server-side fix. Independently of that, I would be happy with a client side fix (so I don't have to be very careful every time I press enter, lots of servers are 074 and < and will stay that way)
12:56 < Learath2> Oh maybe I can share the exact same code
12:57 < Learath2> That would be pretty
13:37 < Dune> I'm skeptical
13:59 < Learath2> Dune: well what you want on the client is to limit connections per second to a NETADDR, no? exactly the same thing on the server
13:59 < Dune> Yeah, but it should be a stronger limit
13:59 < Dune> (use prepatch settings)
14:00 < Dune> I mean, it should expect the 074- behaviour
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Dune: the fix is simple yet stupid
15:09 < Dune> that is?
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you can simply not send disconnect messages to servers you recently connected to
15:10 < Dune> that's dirty
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, you can add a queue for disconnect packets to send
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if you want it to be clean
15:21 < Learath2> I did put a fix into #2518 but I'm not sure I like it
15:24 < Dune> This should be separate
17:44 < Dune> right, it's separate commits anyway
17:53 < Dune> Learath2: I get timeouts after trying your client-side fix
18:01 < Dune> do you?
19:58 < Learath2> Dune: timeouts? like in the game?
19:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Learath2: try spam connecting to a server
20:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it says "Unable to connect to the the server" after 10s of timing out
20:00 < Learath2> It gives me "Too fast" every time for me
20:00 < Learath2> s/me//
20:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes, sure
20:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but then try to wait and connect
20:01 < Learath2> let me try
20:03 < Learath2> Hmm, you seem to get banned
20:03 < Learath2> I don't get how though, the second connect isn't even going through
20:08 < Learath2> If you spam it just right it is possible that the window on the server contains more then 1 connect but the window on the client doesnt
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't know either
20:10 < Learath2> send the first disconnect towards the start of a second on the server but towards the end of a second on the client, you try again and you get "Too fast", you try again but now you are in a new second however the server isn't yet, the server gets another disconnect, you get banned
20:10 < Learath2> idk how to fix it though, not smart enough
20:12 < Learath2> double the window on the client to be safe?
20:43 < Learath2> heinrich5991: It'd be really nice if we could get make_release.py into cmake too, it's an absolute PITA to build with bam and debug, I keep having to skip cd around half the time forgetting what I'm doing
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I have a small script that looks for bam in upper folders, makes it really fast :)
20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think you can build a release with cmake though
22:29 < Learath2> Ah, after hours of searching I figured it out
22:29 < Learath2> burried deep in SDL sources there is a `[NSNumber numberWithBool:NO], @"ApplePressAndHoldEnabled"` that's disabling the accent menu
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what is this magic? `heavy screatching`
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Learath2: you can build a release with cmake as well
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> like in ddnet
23:04 < Learath2> @heinrich5991 did you ever work with objective C? It's surprisingly fun to work with such a dynamic language
23:11 < Learath2> It's like magic, I can hook into the app delegate sdl includes, change it's class methods etc.
