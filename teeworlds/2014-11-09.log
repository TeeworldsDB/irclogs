00:44 < Neox> Dune ? Minus ?
00:44 < Neox> there ?
02:22  * Neox slaps minus around a bit with a large fishbot
02:22 < Neox> heinrich5991 ?

02:23 < Neox> hmm... slapping myself
09:17 <@minus> o\
10:55 < Safa_[A_boy]> Too many issues and pull requests in the github repository :!
10:59 < Teectac> how so ?
11:03 < Safa_[A_boy]> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
11:03 < Safa_[A_boy]> 142 issues
11:06 < Teectac> and ?
11:07 < Safa_[A_boy]> Nothing
18:42 < Neox> hello
18:42 < Neox> does anybody know how to link a library in teeworlds ?
18:43 < Learath2> Neox: depends what kind of library
18:44 < Learath2> well Neox https://github.com/Learath2/teeworlds/commit/656eb00ec723218ecd705874c6fe4c3f315e6d53 this is what i stole from fstd for libcurl
18:44 < Neox> it's a BigInt library (so that I can handle 128 bits numbers...)
18:45 < Neox> oh, thank you =) libcurl... needed to use this once too :P
18:45 < Learath2> BigInt libraries are generally small stuff so you can prolly mimic how its done for json-parser
18:47 < Learath2> Neox: check bam.lua L97 where jsonparser is compiled and L327 where its linked if you are working on 0.7
18:51 < Neox> No, I'm working on 0.6.2, but thanks
19:07 < fstd> fuken stealer
19:07 < fstd> all my codes r patent pending
19:16 <@minus> there there
21:03 < heinrich5991> Neox: if you need 128bit integers, you could consider putting two 64bit integers together
21:05 <@minus> if you need 128 bit integers in a game you're likely doing something wrong
21:05 < Neox> heinrich5991: there is a library for it already
21:05 < Neox> minus: no, you will see, it's a mod I'm coding =) And I bet that it will be always full
21:05 <@minus> it's probably slow as fuck and creates an external dependency
21:05 < heinrich5991> for 128bit integers or for dynamically sized?
21:06 < Neox> heinrich5991: dynamically sized
21:06 < heinrich5991> Neox: so you need a set of X bits, and not an integer?
21:07 < Neox> heinrich5991: uhh... well.. idk how I need to explain this, I just needed something to store a number higher than what unsigned long long int can hold
21:07 < Neox> and I found it (just need to code the mod now ^^), I'll post a topic in the forum once it's done
21:07 < heinrich5991> Neox: (to me it seems you're using the wrong tool for the job, although I don't know the job exactly)
21:08 < Neox> well, lemme pm you
21:17 < Learath2> yaeh you really shouldnt need bigint
21:17 < Teectac> why not ?
21:17 < heinrich5991> Teectac: depending on your use case.
21:18 < Learath2> 3slow to do anything for a game as far as i can imagine
21:23 < Teectac> what do you guys think abt this idea ? https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=112431#p112431
21:26 < Teectac> i think this is the kind of application where you need to keep track of huge quantities
23:49 < heinrich5991> teeworlds uses gettimeofday for time_get() under linux
23:50 < heinrich5991> the man page says that it can jump backward :/
23:50 <@matricks> :/
23:50 <@matricks> time is a complex issue
23:51 <@matricks> favorite youtube about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY

23:51 < heinrich5991> this one doesn't need the complex time stuff (DST, leap seconds, etc.)
23:51 < heinrich5991> the time_get
