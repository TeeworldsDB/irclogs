09:33 < day> when playing ctf without a nick or with a space only name " ", you can glitch out the flag info in the bottom right corner. it looks like noones having the flag
09:53 < day> when the person using the empty name is carrying the flag that is*
09:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Empty usernames was a mistake
11:30 < day> "empty usernames" were patched in knowingly as a feature?
11:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well it wasn't allowed in previous versions
11:36 < day> yeah i know. But it could have been an unintended side effect of another commit
11:37 < rand> do you mean that the hud displays the flag without name (since it's invisible) ?
11:37 < day> yes
11:38 < day> as a carrier you think, "nice i can return to base" only to find out your flag isnt there :Pa
11:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> gotta report it as an issue
11:38 < day> so you are left with listening to the flag drop sound or spamming tab to see who holds the flag
11:39 < day> i can open one later today
11:40 < rand> erf, there is no difference between invisible carrier and flag on standâ€¦
11:40 < rand> that's a game design issue
11:40 < day> o0
11:40 < rand>  UI design
11:40 < day> thats what we are talking about isnt it?
11:41 < rand> yes, nothing new
11:41 < day> um yes it is new
11:41 < day> because in previous versions you couldn have an empty name
11:41 < rand> I mean, I'm just repeating what you are saying with my words :)
11:41 < day> :P
11:42 < rand> empty name or full space name will be a problem
11:42 < rand> iirc, name supports unicode
11:42 < day> oh boi
11:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> spaces are trimmed though
11:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can't leave empty spaces at the end or beginning of name/clan afaik
11:44 < day> btw. what does this mail icon in the chat window mean? ive seen some post that had a small mail icon infront of them + where rendered in cyan 
11:44 < rand> whisper ?
11:45 < day> could be. ive never knowingly seen whisper :p
11:45 < rand> i don't use it, but I got messages sometimes
11:45 < day> same. and i was a little confused
11:46 < rand> can't say if those were intentional or not 
11:46 < day> ^ :D
11:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes, whisper. it's x by default
21:48 < day> when does a server count as modified?
21:49 < day> 194.48.155.221:8307 looks like it found a way around the no name issue. Im guessing the server simply renames players that have no name
21:59 < day> nvm. something reseted my name, might have been 'watching a demo'
22:49 < day> restarting at least resets the nick
