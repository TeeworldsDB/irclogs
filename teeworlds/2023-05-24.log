19:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> @ChillerDragon in regard to the 0.7 protocol. If the server does not have a password, does one simply send an empty string? and what happens if the password is incorrect?[CLIENT->SERVER] Version and password.
19:14 < bridge> <jxsl13> Good read until now (Y)
19:28 < ChillerDragon> thanks :)
19:28 < ChillerDragon> the client sends its password regarldess wether the server wants one or not thats also how you leak your password to all servers you connect to
19:28 < ChillerDragon> if you never set a password it just sends a empty string which is just a single nullbyte
19:29 < ChillerDragon> idk what happens then if you want to investigate that i highly recommend using heinrichs dissector but i assume the server just sends a ctrl close with wrong password
19:30 < bridge> <jxsl13> hmhm
19:31 < bridge> <jxsl13> Gonna attempt implementing a Go client if I find the time.
19:55 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: the password leak stuff was mitigated in ddnet
20:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> it's written there as well.
20:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> in the docs
20:08 < bridge> <jxsl13> that ddnet asks users for confirmation
20:17 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Good docs
