11:43 < heinrich5991> compiling on windows is ridiculously complicated
11:44 < heinrich5991> it just took me an hour to get it barely running for my brother :/
11:44 < heinrich5991> we need to do something there
11:47 <@minus> 0.6 or 0.7?
11:47 < heinrich5991> both aren't really working
11:47 < heinrich5991> the one because the `round` fix wasn't ported to 0.6
11:48 < heinrich5991> the other one because we lack scripts to automatically download sdl, freetype
11:48 <@minus> ideally those have to be built
11:49 <@matricks> heinrich5991: thats usually how it is compiling stuff under windows >.<
11:49 <@matricks> it's insane
11:49 <@matricks> minus: saw the thread that I posted to on the forum? :)
11:50 <@minus> yes
11:50 <@minus> the long reply you posted, right?
11:50 <@matricks> yeah
11:50 <@matricks> about lost of stuff
11:50 <@minus> ^^
11:50 <@matricks> *lots
11:51 <@minus> well, lost isn't wrong either
11:51 < heinrich5991> I liked that post
11:51  * minus np: Purple Motion - 2nd Reality OST (Byproduct remix)
11:51 <@matricks> :D
11:52 <@matricks> I've found out some stuff to speed up bam as well
11:52 <@matricks> and found some bugs as well :)
11:54 <@minus> cmake could probably make the SDL and freetype issue easier

11:57 <@matricks> malmen and teetow :D
11:57 < heinrich5991> minus: we could just use some hacky python script to download the correct version of freetype/SDL
11:58 <@minus> i thought there was problems finding a precompiled version of freetype
12:02 < heinrich5991> freetype from here, if it's working: http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php
12:04 <@minus> bin & dev. should work, since it's a C library and does not depend on a specific compiler version
13:55 < Learath2> heinrich5991: huh it wasnt that hard to get it compiling on windows
13:55 < Learath2> i just had to download python and bam
13:55 < Learath2> atleast with mingw it was quite simple
14:11 < heinrich5991> Learath2: currently you also need to manually download sdl and freetype (and their headers IIRC)
14:32 < Learath2> heinrich5991: not for 0.6 
14:55 < heinrich5991> not for 0.6, indeed
14:56 < heinrich5991> 0.6 build is broken anyway due to the function `round` which is now (?) part of the C++ standard and may be and *is* placed into the global namespace by MSVC++
19:37 < teetow> minus: oh, nice catch =)
