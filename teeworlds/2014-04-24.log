07:20 < DAFT> hello :D
12:49 < Sirgue> Hello!
12:49 <@matricks> HAI
12:49 < Sirgue> Hum.. I've an error when I launch teeworlds client
12:49 < Sirgue> "[5358ea54][gfx]: unable to set video mode: Couldn't find matching GLX visual
12:49 < Sirgue> Can someone help me ?
12:50 <@minus> change gfx_screen_width/height in settings.cfg
12:50 < DAFT> >.<
12:50 <@matricks> or missing gl drivers
12:51 <@matricks> and clean the guck out of the mouse
12:51 < ghost91> oi
12:51 <@matricks> turn it on and off again!
12:51 <@matricks> :P
12:51 < DAFT> there are more ppl here than on twilight
12:51 < DAFT> :D
12:51 <@matricks> no, but removing the settings files usually helps
12:51 < Sirgue> I've already done it
12:52 <@matricks> Sirgue: check what glxinfo says
12:52 < DAFT> light a piece of blits ond put it in ur PC case, that worked for me
12:52 < Sirgue> Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
12:52 < Sirgue> Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual or fbconfig
12:52 < Sirgue> :/
12:52 <@matricks> you are missing opengl :)
12:52 <@minus> sup ghost91
12:52 <@matricks> what computer are you on?
12:53 < Sirgue> Debian ;)
12:53 <@matricks> _computer_, not os
12:53 < ghost91> minus: the ceiling, i guess?
12:53 <@minus> xf86-video-ati comes with opengl :3
12:53 <@minus> ghost91: i guess
12:53 < Sirgue> Ok, what do you mean by "computer" ? video card, etc..?
12:53 <@matricks> ya
12:53 < ghost91> well, I’m currently in a seminar were a guy tells us stuf I already know
12:53 <@matricks> you need to install a proper gfx driver
12:54 < ghost91> stuff*
12:54 < Sirgue> nvidia gt 635m
12:54 <@minus> Sirgue: are you hobby- or professional sysadmin?
12:54 <@matricks> okey, you need to install the driver for that card
12:54 < Sirgue> minus, hobby, not a pro x)
12:54 <@matricks> and how you do that on debian, dunno, I run xubuntu to get away from fiddling :)
12:55 < ghost91> nvidia provides an install shellscript
12:55 < Sirgue> Huh
12:55 <@minus> ghost91: no!
12:55 < ghost91> ?
12:55 < ghost91> they
12:55 < ghost91> do
12:55 <@minus> packages.
12:55 <@minus> no make install shit
12:55 < ghost91> are there any for debian?
12:55 <@matricks> does debian have packages for binary nvidia driver?
12:55 <@minus> there better be
12:55 < ghost91> well, you could always try installing those from ubuntu...
12:55 <@minus> debian itself not
12:56 <@minus> so he is probably running nouveau?
12:56 < ghost91> on my old pc, i used the script from nvidia and it worked fine :D
12:56 < Sirgue> Hum.. Should i install nouveau or the non-free nvidia drivers ?
12:56 < ghost91> non-free
12:56 <@minus> you probably already are running nouveau
12:56 <@minus> AMD > Nvidia!
12:56 < DAFT> no
12:56 < Sirgue> no
12:57 <@matricks> no
12:57 <@minus> radeon works mighty fine, ask BotoX
12:57 <@matricks> well, soonish amd > nvidia :)
12:57 < BotoX> pls no
12:57 < DAFT> intell > AMD
12:57 < BotoX> AMD overlords will please you with free software matricks :s
12:57 < DAFT> NVIDIA > radion
12:57 < BotoX> .kb DAFT 
12:57 < ghost91> well, anyways, install those non-free drivers and it should probably be fine ;)
12:57 <@minus> intel is okish
12:58 < BotoX> ;)
12:58 < DAFT> .kb Botox
12:58 <@matricks> DAFT: we are talkin gfx here, not cpu
12:58 < BotoX> .kb DAFT 
12:58 < BotoX> Intel does make graphics too
12:58 < Sirgue> Ok ghost91 :) But i don't know which version i've to install x)
12:58 < BotoX> lul, I am using intel graphics right now
12:58 <@minus> me too
12:58 < DAFT> :/
12:58 < Sirgue> so many nvidia packets ><
12:59 < DAFT> GTX 760 2 gig 256bit
12:59 < DAFT> :D
12:59 < ghost91> which debian are you on?
12:59 < ghost91> wheezy?
12:59 < DAFT> .kb botox
12:59 < Sirgue> ghost91, yep
13:00 <@minus> you should try archlinux :3
13:00 < ghost91> you got non-free and contrib in your sources?
13:01 < Sirgue> ghost91, yep
13:01 < DAFT> overclock?
13:01 < ghost91> I think the packages you need then are: nvidia-glx, nvidia-kernel-dkms, nvidia-xconfig, nvidia-settings
13:01 < Sirgue> minus, and gentoo ? :P
13:01 < Sirgue> ghost91, ok, I'll try with that
13:02 < ghost91> after installing them, you probably need to run „nvidia-xconfig“ as root
13:02 <@minus> Sirgue: no, gentoo requires too much compiling
13:02 < BotoX> matricks, why'd you want to switch over to nvidia?
13:02 <@matricks> BotoX: huh?
13:03 < Sirgue> ghost91, maybe nvidia-kernel-3.2.0-4-amd64 instead of nvidia-kernel-dkms ?
13:03 < BotoX> <matricks> well, soonish amd > nvidia :)
13:03 <@matricks> BotoX: I've been running nvidia for ages
13:03 < BotoX> ohhhh
13:03 <@matricks> because their drivers has been much better then ati/amd
13:03 < BotoX> I thought you meant that you'll go from amd to nvidia
13:03 < BotoX> with that arrow
13:04 <@minus> why will amd be better than nv?
13:04 <@matricks> no
13:04 <@minus> mantle?
13:04 <@matricks> minus: they are releasing specifications
13:04 <@minus> mh?
13:04 <@matricks> and pushing an open-source driver
13:04 <@minus> there already is one...
13:04 < BotoX> They've been doing it already and are actively developing the open source driver
13:04 <@matricks> minus: well, there is two
13:04 <@minus> which is heaps better than their own
13:05 <@minus> AMD is developing on radeon?
13:05 < BotoX> there's a lot of amd workers in #radeon on freenode
13:05 <@matricks> minus: yeah
13:05 <@minus> oh.
13:05 <@minus> nice.
13:05 < BotoX> they have been for a year now
13:05 <@minus> #radeon is a nice place
13:05 <@matricks> minus: they released the specifications + a baseline driver
13:05 < BotoX> hired a bunch of people who have been commiting code to the repo
13:05 < Sirgue> ghost91 ?
13:06 < BotoX> minus: http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/I_did_it_for_you_all
13:06 < ghost91> ye?
13:06 < ghost91> Sirgue: 
13:06 < BotoX> Is dis real?
13:06 < Sirgue> ghost91, maybe nvidia-kernel-3.2.0-4-amd64 instead of nvidia-kernel-dkms ?
13:06 <@matricks> BotoX: old old joke
13:06 < BotoX> Though, when I look at C++11 it sounds true :p

13:07 <@matricks> DAFT: stop it
13:07 < DAFT> :<
13:07 <@minus> firefox and eclipse not rendering anymore, probably IO problems again, ffs
13:08 < BotoX> >quote
13:08 < DAFT> but what we just chilling
13:08 < DAFT> having fun
13:08 < ghost91> this is waht is says on debian wiki: aptitude -r install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,') nvidia-kernel-dkms
13:08 < DAFT> no harm caused
13:08 < ghost91> do you have the kernel headers already installed?
13:08  * matricks hits DAFT on the nose with a rolled up news paper
13:08 < ghost91> Sirgue: 
13:08 < Sirgue> yep
13:08 < ghost91> hm
13:08 <@minus> BotoX: where'd you get that link from?
13:08  * DAFT chases Matricks around the room with a cattle prod
13:08 < BotoX> from you, wasn't it?
13:09 <@minus> probably
13:09 < BotoX> <minus> http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/I_did_it_for_you_all
13:09 <@matricks> DAFT: chase? I would stand still, some electroplay!
13:09 <@minus> i was wondering why you post it to me
13:09 <@minus> no, it's fake
13:09 < DAFT> :D
13:09 <@minus> inspiring nonetheless
13:09  * DAFT burns his name into Matricks forehead with a branding iron :D
13:09 < ghost91> Sirgue: you can try installing that, too, but I am confused...
13:09 <@matricks> minus: that driver is the reason why I might change my gfx card in the future
13:10 < Sirgue> ghost91, i'll try
13:10 < ghost91> does it not work right now/what happens/have you run the nvidia-…. command
13:10 < ghost91> and restarted?
13:10 < ghost91> maybe that’s needed
13:10 <@minus> matricks: using that driver for well over a year i can tell you it works nicely, most of the time
13:10 < ghost91> so nouveau is blacklisted
13:10 < DAFT> is botox a badass?
13:10 <@matricks> minus: games as well?
13:10 < BotoX> what is this
13:11 <@matricks> and performance compared to the binary driver?
13:11 < DAFT> this is cat
13:11 < Sirgue> ghost91, ok, thank you, i'll try right now :)
13:11 < BotoX> DAFT, may I ask how old you are?
13:11 < DAFT> 25
13:11 < BotoX> seems rather unlikely, you act kinda childish, don't you D:
13:11 < DAFT> thats hard to tell
13:11 < DAFT> over a chat
13:12 < DAFT> on mirc

14:15 < DAFT> [12:58] * You were kicked from #teeworlds by matricks (BotoX )
14:15 < BRAUTLES1> How do i remove [G] from username in TW game ?
14:15 < DAFT> did it tell u to kick me
14:15 <@matricks> [g]?
14:15 < DAFT> yes i also have it
14:15 < DAFT> D:
14:15 < DAFT> if we put in or nickname
14:16 < DAFT> and when we jam on a agame
14:16 < DAFT> it shows [G]DAFT
14:16 < DAFT> even tho we just make the name DAFT
14:16 <@matricks> dunno, is it a clan name or something?
14:17 < DAFT> im leaving clan name blank
14:17 < DAFT> only use nickname
14:17 <@matricks> custom server?
14:17 < DAFT> tried making the clan name same as nickname
14:17 < DAFT> and it didnt change
14:17 < DAFT> braut
14:17 < DAFT> was it a custon server?
14:18 < DAFT> matricks: i dont think so
14:18 <@matricks> is the gametype something else then DM,TDM or CTF?
14:18 < DAFT> to be honest
14:18 < DAFT> i could not connect to it with Quick find
14:18 < DAFT> i had to type in the IP
14:18 < DAFT> with the :
14:18 < DAFT> and onother 4 numbers
14:18 <@matricks> probably some strange modded server
14:19 < DAFT> also, it was just me and this noob brautles1
14:19 < DAFT> the others in the game negver had it
14:19 < DAFT> when im home il take a screenshot
14:19 <@matricks> [G] for Guest perhaps...
14:19 <@matricks> dunno
14:19 < DAFT> ye maybe :)
14:20 <@matricks> if it's a modded server... well.. dunno what it is then, they can do anything basiclly
14:20 < BRAUTLES1> That's what i thought
14:20 < BRAUTLES1> Guest
14:20 < BRAUTLES1> So i've registered
14:20 < DAFT> i have a phat dump on board
14:20 < BRAUTLES1> And loggs in
14:20 < BRAUTLES1> But still the [G]
14:20 < BRAUTLES1> Some other users also have it
14:21 < BRAUTLES1> I checked username under settings
14:21 <@matricks> custom server
14:21 < BRAUTLES1> But it's without the [G]
14:21 <@matricks> teeworlds doesn't have accounts etc
14:21 < BRAUTLES1> When in game it's [G] brautles
14:21 < BRAUTLES1> Someone told me i must register
14:21 < BRAUTLES1> : <
14:21 <@matricks> that server isn't teeworlds
14:21 <@matricks> it's something else
14:21 < DAFT> u registered a virus to ur machince
14:21 < DAFT> WP!
14:22 <@matricks> thats why you can't find it with the quick find without removing some filtering options
14:22 < BRAUTLES1> Shh DAFT
14:22 <@matricks> the default setup only shows teeworlds servers
14:22 < BRAUTLES1> I see...
14:23 < DAFT> the tee's little hooks are almost like clockworks :D
14:27 < BRAUTLES1> lolz yeah
14:27 < BRAUTLES1> I managed to fix my issue
14:27 < BRAUTLES1> zzZ
14:28 < BRAUTLES1> Whata newb
14:28 < BRAUTLES1> I've registered on teeworlds.com
14:28 < BRAUTLES1> And not .co.za
14:28 < BRAUTLES1> Local etc

15:59 < Siile> I'm testing some new features in Tee Defence (tower defence -style server mod for teeworlds)
15:59 < Siile> anyone wanna join?
16:09 < Siile> ;_____;
16:10 < Learath2> Siile: i have some spare time
16:10 < Siile> cool
16:10 < Siile> Server up (Tee Defence)
16:10 < Siile> Password: siile
16:10 < Learath2> cant see thy server
16:11 < Siile> refresh
16:11 < Learath2> is it 0.7 ?
16:11 < Siile> 0.62
16:11 < Learath2> nvm
16:11 < Learath2> found it now
16:11 < ghost91> buh
16:12 < ghost91> sirgue: have you been able to solve your problem?
16:14 < sirgue> ghost91, nope :(
16:15 < ghost91> hm, I don’t know what to do then, sorry
16:15 < ghost91> what does glxinfo say?
16:16 < sirgue> In fact, when i tried to reboot, X didn't start, so i tried to install nvidia-kernel-3.2.* instead, and reboot my PC
16:17 < sirgue> And X started, but same error with teeworld ::
16:17 < ghost91> hmm
16:17 < ghost91> did you run that nvidia-settings thing?
16:18 < ghost91> I think this will modify your xorg.conf, and this is neccersary
16:19 < ghost91> https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers#configure
16:20 < ghost91> well, if all this does not work, you still have the option to install the driver directly from nvidia by using the script
16:20 < ghost91> you can simply download that from the nvidia drivers website
16:21 < sirgue> "download that from the nvidia drivers website" I'll try that
16:22 < ghost91> but well, I’d really only se that if nothing else works
16:23 < ghost91> because this will install the kernel modules and stuff bypassing the package system
16:23 < ghost91> that is not really what you want
16:23 < ghost91> you could also try this: http://www.tecmint.com/install-nvidia-drivers-in-linux/
16:24 < ghost91> it’s more or less, what I told you, but they install some more pckages
16:24 < ghost91> and they manually blacklist nouveau
16:26 < ghost91> anyways, some years ago, i used the script from nvidia (there was no package back then) and it simply worked
16:26 < ghost91> maybe that’s the easier solution for you
17:45 < sirgue> Heya
17:45 < sirgue> minus, finally, it worked !
17:46 < sirgue> I installed bumblebee x)
17:47 <@minus> laptop?
17:47 < sirgue> Yep
17:48 < sirgue> Optimus x)
17:52 <@minus> that shit sucks
17:53 <@minus> turned the dedicated GPU in my laptop off
17:54 < sirgue> My EFI sucks
17:54 < sirgue> i can't enable Legacy boot
17:54 < sirgue> So i think i can't disable the intel GPU
18:33 < FATTYBOOMBOOM> hello
