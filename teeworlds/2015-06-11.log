13:27 < Dune> Hey
13:27 < Dune> On installing Ubuntu on a virtual machine I saw Teeworlds in the preview screens in "top rated games", never noticed that!
13:28 <@matricks> :P
13:46 < EastByte> Dune: afaik it's there since years :P
13:47 < Dune> arr
16:49 < Edible> would tw be playable in win10?
16:50 <@matricks> dunno
16:50 < Edible> its not playable in 8, so...
16:50 <@matricks> I prefer to use an OS
16:50 <@matricks> Edible: it's not?
16:50 < Edible> well, i couldnt get it to run
16:50 < Edible> maybe someone did
16:51 <@matricks> what happens?
16:51 < Edible> idr
16:51 < Edible> it was too long ago
16:52 < Edible> so i guess, it works now? no reported problems in win8 ?
16:53 <@matricks> dunno, I don't keep track
16:53 <@matricks> loads of other things to fiddle with
17:05 < EastByte> Edible: there definitely are players playing on win8
17:06 < Edible> alright then
17:06 < EastByte> and you shouldn't worry about teeworlds anyway
17:06 < Edible> its the only game I play,
17:06 < EastByte> it's an opensource game and it will run on any platform anyway
19:35 < moonlorn> hi
19:35 <@minus> greetings
19:44 < moonlorn> i was thinking about setting up a teeworlds server on an amazon ec2 instance to play with a friend, does anyone have any experience doing that?
19:44 < moonlorn> i was wondering if t2.micro is good enough
19:47 <@minus> easily
19:47 <@minus> teeworlds takes like a couple of MB RAM
19:47 < moonlorn> i wasn't sure about network performance on the t2.micro instances
19:48 < moonlorn> i guess teeworlds isn't very bandwidth intensive so it's just about latency to the server
19:48 <@minus> network performance should be no different on any type of ec2 instance
19:48 < moonlorn> ah ok
19:48 <@minus> people usually get vpses to host teeworlds on, no idea if going with amazon is cheaper, probably not
19:51 < moonlorn> i should look into that
19:52 <@minus> you could just use one of the thousand public servers though
19:52 <@minus> you should've made teeworlds_srv more resource intesive, matricks
19:58 < BotoX> heh
19:58 < BotoX> https://github.com/upTee/upTee
19:59 < BotoX> I guess this is finished, isn't it?
19:59 < BotoX> or finished as in dead :p
20:00 <@minus> >#teeworlds-dev at irc.quakenet.org
20:00 <@minus> i'd go with dead
20:00 < BotoX> it's really sexy though
20:00 < moonlorn> i want a server with approx same lag for each of us
20:00 < BotoX> haha
20:00 < BotoX> you mean latency?
20:00 < moonlorn> i'm in western australia, he's in virgina USA
20:00 < moonlorn> yeah
20:00 < BotoX> new jersey I guess
20:01 < BotoX> or florida
20:01 <@minus> tough luck
20:01 < moonlorn> tokyo servers seem to give similar lag fro both fo us
20:01 <@minus> australia is a great place for online gaming
20:01 < BotoX> haha
20:01 < moonlorn> :P
20:02 <@minus> drop the "al" and you're good to go :3
20:02 < BotoX> hehe
20:02 < BotoX> routing on my current ISP is garbage though
20:03 < BotoX> +25ms to NJ/NY as compared to other ISPs
20:04 < BotoX> Top is my server roughly 10km away from me, bottom is my home connection: https://i.botox.bz/1434045876.png
20:05 < BotoX> a whopping +40ms
20:05 < BotoX> insane
20:05 <@minus> route through your server then?
20:06 < BotoX> huehuehue
20:06 < BotoX> my traffic is backhauled through vienna
20:06 < BotoX> which adds 20ms!!!!!
20:06 < BotoX> but yeah it'd probably make it better
20:06 < BotoX> +23ms to my server
20:07 < BotoX> first hop is 10ms
20:07 < BotoX> which is 2km away
20:07 < BotoX> I don't know what they are doing
20:07 <@minus> cable?
20:07 < BotoX> yes
20:07 < BotoX> my cable stats are perfect
20:07 < BotoX> DOCSIS3.0
20:07 < BotoX> that doesn't have interleaving, does it?
20:09 < BotoX> interoute really does have nice routing though
20:10 < BotoX> my other server in graz has ntt routing and an avg. ping of 110ms to NJ, interoute has avg. 95ms
20:10 < BotoX> and UPC avg. 138ms kek
20:13 < BotoX> sadface.png https://i.botox.bz/1434046403.png
20:14 <@minus> raspi at edis?
20:14 < BotoX> I should just put some fiber to my server
20:14 < BotoX> yeah
20:14 <@minus> do they still accept raspis?
20:14 < BotoX> hmm
20:14 <@minus> mine's just lying around
20:15 < BotoX> could ask someone I know there
20:15 < BotoX> but a friend of mine also does free raspi colo
20:15 < BotoX> the one where my server sakura is colo'd
20:15 < BotoX> the one with the best routing
20:16 < BotoX> You could build an ADS-B antenna, get an RTL-SDR dongle and catch some airplanes! https://i.botox.bz/IMG_20150602_215321.jpg
20:16 < BotoX> and let the raspi report the airplanes to flightradar24
20:17 < BotoX> I'll put that antenna up with a raspi and an OpenWRT Wi-Fi router with a "better" antenna on my house in croatia
20:17 < BotoX> direct line of sight to an airport
20:18 < BotoX> don't have an internet connection there, that's what the wi-fi router is for ^^
