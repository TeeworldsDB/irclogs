11:02 <@heinrich5991> minus: posting in the forum results in Could not connect to smtp host "mail.mnus.de:465" (110) (Connection timed out).
11:05 <@minus> checking
11:50 <@minus> heinrich5991: should work again
11:51 <@heinrich5991> can confirm
11:51 <@minus> mail server VM was dead
11:52 <@heinrich5991> why does that stop forum posts? :)
11:52 <@heinrich5991> do you get an email for every post?
11:52 <@minus> i think you can sign up to get email notifications about new posts
11:52 <@minus> and the design of punbb doesn't account for SMTP failure
11:53 <@heinrich5991> ah
15:03 < koomi> can anyone subscribe for those emails?
15:06 <@minus> i think so
15:16 < koomi> then that poses the question if a single unresponsive mail server can DoS the entire forum
15:18 <@heinrich5991> koomi: I think it was the mail server that was supposed to *send* the mails, not the ones which receive it
15:19 < koomi> ah
22:46 < necropotame> I no more receive notification by mail :(
