10:19 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr opened pull request #1990: Fix automapper randomization (master...fix-automap-random) https://git.io/fhE1j
10:41 < Oy> Dune: u know what "value" supposed to be? smaller number leads to more doodads or is it supposed to be the opposite?
11:29 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fhEyN
11:29 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master f469fb4 oy: added a 5 second cooldown for responding to a banned user that wants to connect (econ, server). otherwise silently ignore the attempt
11:39 <@Dune> Oy: random=50 => chance 1/50th
11:39 <@Dune> @LordSk
11:41 < Oy> ah ok
11:42 <@Dune> hmm, getting trouble with the download script
11:42 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed pull request #1990: Fix automapper randomization (master...fix-automap-random) https://git.io/fhE1j
11:42 <@Dune> bam: error: 'other/freetype/windows/lib64/freetype.dll' does not exist and no way to generate it
11:43 < Oy> hm
11:43 <@Dune> and sometimes 'unable to create already existing file' for sdl/include
11:43 <@Dune> haven't investigated yet
11:43 < Oy> does the download fail?
11:44 <@Dune> it does not seem to start
11:45 < Oy> oh
11:45 < Oy> always?
11:45 <@Dune> i fixed it manually by moving other\freetype\win64
11:45 < Oy> which python version do u have?
11:45 < Oy> 2 or 3
11:45 <@Dune> 3
11:46 <@Dune> also https://pastebin.com/jsYXDX1t
12:19 <@heinrich5991> reviewed the sorting pr. I think it would be best if we didn't roll our own sorting
12:20 < Oy> what else do you wanna use?
12:21 <@heinrich5991> std::sort
12:21 <@heinrich5991> as is used in the server browser
12:21 <@heinrich5991> or std::stable_sort for stable sort
12:24 < Oy> using stable_sort there yeah
12:25 < Oy> could do that
12:39 < Oy> my concern is that we introcude some bug with our implementation, which might occur very rare and/or does not seem as it's linked to the sorting
12:40 <@heinrich5991> yep, mine too... that's why I'd prefer to use the sort from the standard library
12:42 <@Dune> is sorting critical anywhere anyway?
12:43 <@Dune> I'm concerned the standard library is awful in terms of performance
12:45 < Oy> heinrich left a comment where we use sorting in tw
12:48 < Oy> dunno if the standard library one provides the same result on every platform, but it seems it's not needed
13:24 <@heinrich5991> std::stable_sort must produce the same result on all platforms by specification, std::sort might result in different orderings of elements with the same key
13:24 <@heinrich5991> generally, I'd assume that standard library functions are reasonably optimized
13:41 < Oy> vote for std:stable_sort then
13:43 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fhEQV
13:43 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 6ec984b oy: let the download script remove the extraction folder in case it exists
13:43 < Oy> Dune: ^ that should fix that FileExistsError you get
13:43 <@Dune> ah, I'll check later, I'm taking a train
13:45 < Oy> ok
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Haha ` <Dune> bam: error: 'other/freetype/windows/lib64/freetype.dll' does not exist and no way to generate it`
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think that is because I compiled the wrong target. Will check when home
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think that is because I compiled the wrong target. Will check when home
15:00 < Oy> try a forced recompile with -f
22:12 <@Dune> @heinrich5991, what's UB?
22:12 < minus> undefined behavior?
22:13 <@Dune> thanks 
22:39 <@heinrich5991> Dune: in particular, creating null references and pointers more than one past the end of the array is not permitted in C++
22:39 <@Dune> I wrongly assumed what last() did
