17:35 < aroz> i did it. now i have my favorite game teeworlds.
17:35 < aroz> Hi.
17:38 < nev> whatcha do?
17:49 < aroz> i had linux only memory stick one month. today i got new hard drive and installed linux ubuntu budgie and steam. i have new headset too :> 
17:53 < nev> wow, you can play teeworlds on linux?
17:53 < nev> that's amazing
17:55 <@heinrich5991> yep, it's been available for linux since forever
17:57 < nev> mind you, I can't imagine running anything with buntu. considering gnome uses 50% CPU for me
18:00 < aroz> i didin't have computer between 2010 and 2020 and i dreamed of linux and capture flag game, because Team Fortress Classic was my favorite game. I hadn't heard of teeworld :> everything is not always self-evident.. Capture the flag is funny.
18:06 < bridge_> <jxsl13> happiness before reality hits hard. *cough ctf nearly dead, cough end*
18:06 < bridge_> <jxsl13> hope you find mates to play with
18:08 < bridge_> <d_une> in fact, when you open the ubuntu store, teeworlds was on the front of it for a good while. there aren't so many games straight up developed with that platform in mind
18:10 < bridge_> <stiopa> what is in the front store right now then? teeworlds should reclaim its spot in the limelight :)
18:11 < bridge_> <d_une> havent opened ubuntu store for a while :)
18:11 < bridge_> <d_une> factorio works well on linux, unsure what else
18:12 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> factorio is probably not in the ubuntu store though
18:13 < bridge_> <d_une> good point
19:39 < bridge_> <reitw> good choice
19:57 < aroz> <jxsl13> hope you find mates to play with <---------- can i get chillersdragon ctf 5 server ip??? And everybody think the IRC is dead but here is better, bigger and wiser chats than 2000...
