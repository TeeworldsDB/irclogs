09:10 < guest__> Hi, is there a tool to administrate server from shell? (script)
09:11 <@matricks> dunno, think you can telnet into the server now adays
09:14 < guest__> ok, I will try. Nobody asked for this kind of tool?
09:15 <@matricks> someone probably have :) and I dunno if there is away to control it now a days
09:15 <@matricks> a bit out of the loop
09:25 < guest__> hum, first test is not convincing. I'll look at the source if I have time.
17:53 < floreo> hello
17:54 <@matricks> herro
17:54 < floreo> guest__: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10700
17:54 < floreo> I was thinking about making specific jails for fail2ban for tw
17:54 < floreo> would it make sense?
17:55 < floreo> for example blocking flood like connected many times in a short period
18:00 < floreo> guest__: sry I misread, I thought it was to manage servers but not from rcon, that would be a wrapper to add to the tool though :)
18:00 <@matricks> floreo: FEEED MEEE!!
18:05 < floreo> matricks: I give u the oreo, I keep the fl, deal? :p
18:06 <@matricks> deal
18:06 < floreo> :)
18:06 < floreo> actually I keep the oreo too :p
18:06 <@matricksoreo> u lied to me :((
18:07 < floreo> I would look even more stupid with only fl, understand me !
18:08  * matricks gives floreo the silent treatment
18:09 < floreo> uhh strict mode
18:09 <@matricks> humf, I should do some codin' tonight
18:10 < floreo> depends on when is tonight :D
18:10 <@matricks> it's 18:10 here
18:10 <@minus> what coding, matricks?
18:10 < floreo> I'd like too, but I'd like to know if I can get info from the log for fail2ban :p
18:10 < floreo> same here
18:11 <@matricks> minus: either some rust, or I should improve my flightlog to include passenger data now as well when I'm doing tandem
18:11 <@minus> whatcha rusting?
18:11 <@minus> i should do some opengling
18:11 <@matricks> minus: recreating a party hack demo as a testbed
18:12 <@matricks> slow progress nowever
18:12 <@matricks> *however
18:12 <@minus> i first have to start out with making it draw a triangle
18:12 <@matricks> hehe
18:12 <@minus> not simple :<
18:13 <@minus> i was up to a torus, as you might know
18:13 <@matricks> I like rust more and more, kinda forces you to write better code :)
18:13 <@matricks> minus: yeah :D
18:13 <@minus> i thought about doing it in rust or go too
18:13 <@minus> but that'd be a large extra hurdle
18:13 <@matricks> yah
18:14 <@matricks> rust isn't that nice to get into at the moment :)
18:14 <@matricks> it's getting better however
18:14 <@matricks> especially since cargo came out (package system)
18:14 <@minus> packaging systems are fuckin great
18:14 <@minus> if they do their job properly *glares at vertx*
18:15 <@matricks> yeah, before cargo, dependencies were horrible to manage
18:15 <@minus> centra index is cool
18:15 <@minus> +l
18:15 <@matricks> this is non-central
18:15 <@matricks> you point it towards other git servers etc
18:16 <@minus> that's gay
18:16 <@matricks> decentralized <3
18:16 <@minus> well, as long as it autobuilds
18:16 <@matricks> it does
18:16 <@minus> some search to find shit is super useful
18:16 <@matricks> [dependencies.gl]
18:16 <@matricks> git = "https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs.git"
18:16 <@matricks> thats a dependency, all I need to write
18:16 <@minus> yeah, i've seen that
18:16 <@matricks> and it will download and autobuild it for me
18:17 <@minus> no versioning?
18:17 <@minus> i guess you can give it some tag too
18:17 <@matricks> yeah
18:17 <@matricks> not that applicable at the moment
18:17 <@matricks> everything is in flux more or less
18:17 <@matricks> I check the travis-ci before I do an update to make sure that my dependencies builds
18:18 <@minus> also gotta make sure it's compatible
18:18 <@minus> where does it install those deps to, does it autobuild them and cache the libraries/objects?
18:18 <@matricks> cached
18:18 <@matricks> in ~/.cargo or something like that
18:19 <@minus> nice.
18:19 <@minus> (though it better be ~/.cache/cargo)
18:19 <@matricks> dunno if it counts as cache
18:19 <@matricks> adunno
18:19 <@minus> maybe i'll try building that example again
18:19 <@minus> it's not application data, it can be rebuilt any time
18:20 <@matricks> sure, ln -s yadda yadda :D
18:20 <@minus> 33 aur/rust-git 2:0.10.1962.ge55f64f-1 [installed: 2:0.10.1545.g3bec8d7-1] (26)
18:21 <@minus> recent enough? :D
18:21 <@matricks> I use rustup
18:21 <@matricks> curl https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo bash
18:25 <@minus> don't need that on arch, thankfully
18:25 <@minus> does that install cargo too?
18:25 <@matricks> yah
18:25 <@matricks> it's from the cargo homepage
18:26 <@minus> cargo fails to build :/
18:43 <@minus> src/gl/lib.rs:88:1: 88:94 error: Did not find version 4.5 in the registry
18:43 <@minus> ._.
18:43 < botnik> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=._.
19:13 < floreo> would it be "smart" to use this log "client dropped. cid=0 addr=x.x.x.x:xxxxx reason=''" to set a jail for fail2ban? if it detects it x times in x s, it would ban the ip
19:24 <@minus> to counter rapid reconnecting? sure
19:32 < floreo> yes I wanna make a few fail2ban rules, looking for some log to find useful ones
19:32 < floreo> minus: thanks
19:32 < floreo> when does the stressing log happen?
19:33 <@matricks> NAOW CODE
19:33 <@minus> matricks: YOU CAN DO IT!
19:34 <@matricks> damn uit
19:34 <@matricks> my right mouse button has started to be worn out
19:34 <@minus> matricks: stream your desktop so we can keep an eye out on if you're really coding
19:34 <@matricks> minus: dunno how to do that :)
19:34 <@minus> me neither :D
19:34 <@minus> using some proprietary software i guess
19:35 <@minus> twitch n stuff
19:35 <@matricks> holy shit this is annoying, I have to get a new mouse
19:35 <@minus> how old?
19:36 <@matricks> not that old :/
19:36  * matricks fetches a new mouse
19:36 <@minus> "Castawesome is a Gtk3 frontend for ffmpeg streaming with builtin Twitch.tv support."
19:36 <@minus> you have one in store? ._.
19:36 <@matricks> ahh, much better
19:36 <@matricks> minus: ofcause :)
19:36 <@minus> that was quick
19:36 <@matricks> I have a closet full of gear :)
19:36 <@minus> hm, actually i have a MX 518 too that i could use as fallback
19:37 <@minus> but i prefer my performance mx
19:37 <@matricks> I have an old mx300 :)
19:37 <@matricks> gotta buy new mouses
19:37 <@matricks> moices
19:37 <@matricks> mices
19:37 <@matricks> damn it
19:37 <@minus> mice
19:37 <@matricks> I always keep an extra mouse and keyboard handy :)
19:38 <@matricks> and fans..
19:38 <@matricks> and graphics cards...
19:38 <@matricks> and network cards...
19:38 <@matricks> and ssds...
19:38 <@matricks> and cpu fans...
19:38 <@minus> wow
19:38 <@matricks> okey.. I have a spare of most of the parts :)
19:38 <@minus> i just keep an extra computer around
19:38 <@minus> i.e. my laptop :D
19:38 <@matricks> I have a laptop... and a spare laptop
19:39 <@minus> how old is your current desktop?
19:39 <@matricks> 4 years I think
19:39 <@matricks> I have no need to upgrade it at the moment
19:39 <@minus> that is rather old indeed
19:39 <@minus> mine's 5
19:39 <@matricks> i7 860, 8gb of ram
19:39 <@minus> i should finally replace my cpu fan
19:39 <@minus> it's too loud
19:39 <@matricks> I've replaced the ssd, and psu (broken)
19:40 <@minus> Phenom II X4 965 BE, 6GB of RAM (1 DIMM failed)
19:40 <@matricks> doh :)
19:40 <@minus> i also have replaced a failed PSU )years ago)
19:40 <@minus> and added an SSD
19:40 <@matricks> damn PSUs, they all seem to fail now adays
19:40 <@minus> and a HD 5870, 3 years ago
19:41 <@minus> you have a 4k monitor, right?
19:41 <@matricks> no
19:41 <@minus> 2560x1440?
19:41 <@matricks> x1600
19:41 <@minus> nice
19:41 <@matricks> 30"
19:41 <@matricks> good colors :)
19:41 <@minus> i have 2560x1440, 27"
19:41 <@matricks> cost 10k swedish
19:42 <@matricks> ~ 1k euro
19:42 <@minus> so ~1000€, mine was ~500€
19:42 <@matricks> dell ultrasharp
19:42 <@minus> same
19:42 <@minus> U2713HM
19:43 <@minus> dell has a 32" 4k monitor for 1500€, something like that might be next, but i'm fine for now :D
19:43 <@matricks> :D
19:43 <@matricks> yeah, I just bought loads of stuff so
19:43 <@matricks> for like 4k euro so
19:44 <@minus> heh
19:44 <@matricks> the tandem gear :)
19:57 < floreo> uh just wanted to make a test for fail2ban, installed from package teeworlds-server on a debian vps, and binary is in /usr/games which is not by default in the PATH
20:19 < SNAK3> hi !
20:19 < SNAK3> Can someone help me with a very simple question? 
20:20 < SNAK3> can i remove the folder data/mapres when i'm only using the server ?
20:20 <@minus> yes
20:20 <@minus> also, why not just try
20:20 <@minus> also, assuming you're just using standard maps
20:21 < SNAK3> and countryflags and languages to ?
20:21 < SNAK3> when i'm using non-standart maps i need the pics ?
20:21 <@minus> hm, nope
20:22 < SNAK3> so for server purpose i only need to preserve the data/maps folder ? o.o
20:24 <@minus> just try, it'll complain if something's wrong
20:25 < SNAK3> allright 
20:26 < SNAK3> seems to be working :P 
20:33 <@matricks> SNAK3: why the diet?
20:37 <@minus> how's the coding progressing, matricks?
20:38 <@matricks> bad :)
20:38 <@matricks> cleaning appartment
20:38 <@matricks> prepped a bit for tomorrow
20:38 <@minus> procrastinating, i see
20:39 <@matricks> hehe
