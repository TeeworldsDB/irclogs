10:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Oh alright
10:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune who do you blame to call buddies to upvote on github?
10:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune>

10:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the checkboxes feel so huge to me
10:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> they're the size of a tee
10:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> checkboxes cant be hughe enough it is nice UX if they are easy to hit
10:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well yeah they were always that size it seems
10:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> just seems strange relative to the size of the text
10:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh and @Dune could you please explain the PS statement on github?
10:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's self-explanatory
10:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I am not sure but i assume you blamed me to do it and you critizie me for that. Thats not cool :c
10:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> just saw a sudden wave of people registering github accounts for that, that's all.
10:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I agree I also was very supprized that these random dudes popper out of nowhere but I didnt talk to anyone about the wallhammer i only mentioned it here on this discord
10:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> aight well someone called 'em in
10:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but meh whatever
10:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I am not sure. Who should have done it. Fokkonaut is probably too lazy and nobody else is interested. But it is a good idea anyways i should motivate some actual players to join the conversation on github.
10:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> whatever
10:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> idc
10:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh by the way is it intentional that the tw dir is lowercase on linux and uppercase on macOS ?
10:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
10:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I know there are no actual cases in files in macOS but the autocompletion still fails if you type "teew". Is it some sort of convention to use lowercase on linux and uppercase on macOS? It is a bit annoying to switch it in my brain all the time.

10:39 < rand> (master)
10:40 < Dune> the checkboxes are quite pixelated too
10:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Wait are these checkboxes new?
10:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> My checkboxes arent pixelated
10:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
10:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/517999377336500244/Screenshot_from_2018-11-30_10-43-26.png
10:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Or is it my small screen?
10:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rebuild with current master and have the same result. For me on debian is see no pixels c:
11:04 < rand> dunno why pixelated, it's in window mode, with a lower res than my screen
11:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I used fullscreen mode with the resolution of my screen.
11:06 < rand> https://ptpb.pw/D1tt.png with my resolution (window mode also)
11:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> What resolution do you have?
11:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> It doesn't look perfect but pretty okay i guess. Depends on the resolution your screen has i think.
11:07 < rand> FullHD dual screen
11:07 < rand> the screenshot I took was with 720p
11:08 < rand> this might be another issue : https://ptpb.pw/imOA.png
11:08 < rand> fullscreen + dual screen
11:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what do you mean?
11:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> You have two screens?
11:08 < rand> https://ptpb.pw/MQUP.png
11:09 < rand> I have
11:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> And if you turn fullscreen on it spans over both of them? Ah ye i know that bug. Its funny.
11:10 < rand> no, it only use one screen, but it seems that teeworlds try to use both and scale the content that way
11:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm
11:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I know that one aswell. But i also had it with one screen only. That it is zoomed in. I had all the cases xd zoomed in at the top bottom center and corners.
11:11 < rand> btw, I add the ai flag to my server, giving a use case for people who want to test client features (serverbrowser, ingame menu...)
11:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> oh thanks rand
11:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I realized that on windows sometimes tabbing out fixed the zoom bug.
