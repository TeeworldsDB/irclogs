00:55 < heinrich5991> I wonder whether teeworlds would be suitable for asm.js compilation

00:55 < heinrich5991> pretty cool IMO
02:48 < eeeee> asm.js is just for optimization
02:49 < eeeee> it does not actually add anything new to javascript
02:50 < eeeee> and last time i checked performance benefits were actually negligible
19:48 < heinrich5991> eeeee: I heard in firefox it essentially boils down to being a bytecode
19:49 < heinrich5991> it can even be compiled to assembly IIRC
20:01 < eeeee> yeah but the regular js is also pretty heavily optimized and jitted. like a year ago i was working on a C to js compiled project and actually benchmarked the asm.js target, it was like 10% faster but a bunch of shit broke
20:04 < eeeee> maybe they added some new optimizations for asm.js the past year tho, but probably only in firefox since asm.js is sort of a mozilla thing
