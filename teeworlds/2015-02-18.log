09:14 < JulianAssange> anybody ever used clang's static analyzer?
09:15 <@matricks> no actually
09:18 < JulianAssange> it should include checks to see if a function may return NULL, and if it can, is it ever used without checking it against null
09:19 < JulianAssange> e.g. char *whatever = malloc(1); whatever[0] = 0;
