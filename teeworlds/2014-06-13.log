02:49 < Commie> anyone know how to edit teeworlds-data sounds?
02:49 < Commie> the .wv files are... funny
02:50 < Commie> or, properly, opening them with audacity, editing them, and exporting them seems to make them unusable
07:00 <@minus> ok, there we go, files are being placed automatically. now i just need to get that hook going
07:01 <@minus> Commie: .wv is wavpack
07:05 <@minus> time for breakfast & work o/
07:22 <@matricks> :P
07:22 <@matricks> Commie: .wv is compressed, wavpack, you neeed to edit the source data and then repack them to wavpack
