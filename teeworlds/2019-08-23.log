15:32  * bridge [teeworlds] <Assa> some
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I prefee the ones with the thicker contours. chera, pikminwhite, ears of pikminyellow greensward the two below are kinda super spikey, clefairy is teeish, but well, it's a pokemon(people would want all pokemon). mouse is cool, whis as well, bunny. Cannot decide for giraffe. bunny is perfect. speedpunk and wolftee have too many too small details. the other ones are also fitting.
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I prefer the ones with the thicker contours. chera, pikminwhite, ears of pikminyellow greensward the two below are kinda super spikey, clefairy is teeish, but well, it's a pokemon(people would want all pokemon). mouse is cool, whis as well, bunny.

15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> bunny is the most ugly one imo :/
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe give him a bigger body in order to get the proportions right.
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I kinda like greensward and kintaro they are cool but a bit too detailed with the spikes
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> @jxsl13 problem with that is that the ears would clip the bounderies
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> bigger body without changing the ear positions :D?
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ÔºÉ6909> I think whis, greyfox, nanami and kintaro_2 are the most teeish there
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> been trying to redraw that fox skin and ended up with a bunny hybrid
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> https://gyazo.com/fe7596f0f3a9a10c4c07217f7eec4c93
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> looks good, I don't identify a bunny there
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ÔºÉ6909> Btw someone knows why kintaro is "_2" ?
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <WsY[FU]?> kintaro_2 doesn't look teeish at all
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> looks more bunny than fox imo when looked at the marking and hairs on the bottem belly the ears need work for it to be full bunny
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> https://gyazo.com/272599684d6e0f52afbff2d92a311180
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> bunny but it's cliping üò¢
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> make the ears fold over üòâ
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> mh
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that is more of a bunny
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I need a naked tee skin for a guy whose nick is "naked tee" >:O
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> pls gib üò¢
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i have a naked skin
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but it is NSFW
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so I can send it in private message only

17:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *send nudes*
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> something like this
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/614480328995766278/NakedTee.svg
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> make no eyes for this xd
20:43 <@Dune> o/
20:43 <@Dune> no irc bot :<
20:43 <@Dune> would be nice to rename cl_threadsoundloading to have it override previous settings.cfg 
20:43 <@Dune> that's a bit hackish though, not sure how one could get around it
20:44 < Oy> \o
20:44 < Oy> yeah seems like the only way
20:44 <@Dune> I guess the proper way to go about it would have been to not store settings that are default
20:45 <@Dune> so what, do we change it to cl_nothreadsoundloading [0]/1 ?
20:45 < Oy> good idea, should change that for the next version, then we're ready for the next time a default value changes :)
20:46 <@Dune> yeah :)
20:46 <@Dune> binds already work that way for some reason
20:46 < Oy> cl_nothreadsoundloading sounds kinda odd :D
20:46 <@Dune> yeah it does :D
20:46 < Oy> isn'T there another thread config?
20:47 <@Dune> jordy@aphrodite:~/tw/tw$ grepr thread src/game/src/game/variables.h:22:MACRO_CONFIG_INT(ClThreadsoundloading, cl_threadsoundloading, 0, 0, 1, CFGFLAG_CLIENT|CFGFLAG_SAVE, "Load sound files threaded")
20:47 <@Dune> I guess not?
20:50 < Oy> yeah, just GfxAsyncRender
20:50 <@Dune> ah
20:51 < Oy> SndSyncLoading?
20:51 <@Dune> So do we just leave the config name as it is and let older users waste a second?
20:51 <@Dune> ah
20:51 <@Dune> sounds good, but maybe Async?
20:51 <@Dune> since we have GfxAsyncRender
20:52 < Oy> but then 0 wouldn'T work
20:52 < Oy> async means thradded
20:52 <@Dune> yeah
20:52 <@Dune> so default it to 1
20:52 <@Dune> Probably prefix it with Snd, since we already use that prefix :)
20:52 < Oy> then people need to change it theirself
20:53 < Oy> if we chnge the default
20:53 <@Dune> Not if we change the name to SndAsyncLoading
20:53 < Oy> right
20:53 <@Dune> On a side note, I understand why snd_enable used to also not init sounds :D that is heavier stuff than I thought
20:54 < Oy> yeah, lots of resources
20:54 <@Dune> you'd think gfx would be heavier
20:55 <@Dune> the music is only 0.7/3.2MB of audio actually
20:58 < Oy> 0.6 had the music too
20:59 <@Dune> oh right
21:00 < Oy> 0.6.2 or so
21:31 < Oy> Dune: do u use steam much?
21:31 <@Dune> almost never Oy
21:41 < Oy> oh ok
21:41 < Oy> the chat keeps messages when someone isn't online
21:41 < Oy> could add u, if you want to drop a msg 
21:43 <@Dune> right
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you could save the version in the settings.cfg
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and if the next teeworlds version comes out, you could "convert it"
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the problem is that you need a converter for each version jump
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> https://gyazo.com/6553b1937ddee87b4ae1e803e123fd2b
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> bunny with hanging ears
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> they don't look hanging
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> my thouths a swell
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> my thouths as well
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> :/
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you could make the hanging parts mor edgy and move them from the tee away
22:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e6/b9/eb/e6b9eb92b75f73b9139234256f64966c.jpg
22:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> like this
22:13 < Oy> Assa just skipping default values when writing the config seems easier that using a converter
22:13 < Oy> converter seem like too much overhead
22:14 < Oy> Zatline: looks like a jackal :)
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> https://gyazo.com/6aa2d0f0d16f1bbf530559da989f2c99
22:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> seems better now üôÇ
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> hmm intresting pov Oy hm
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> its really better üëç
22:35 < Oy> looks better than the previous one
22:49 < Oy> could do a billy bumbler tee with it \o/
22:59 <@Dune> looks good yeah
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> why does Oy pop up when I search billy bumbler ?? haha üòÑ
23:04 < Oy> what a coincidence :D
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> well Oy I had planed in drawing a raccoon skin the next days I think that would suit that very very well
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> well Oy I had planed in drawing a raccoon skin the next days I think that would suit you very very well
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> naked tee Oo
23:07 < Oy> yeah racoon would fit well
23:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> is it a lifegoal to start a review of your own code on your own PR?
23:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> teeworlds deployment for latest build clean source: https://github.com/AssassinTee/teeworlds
23:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the builds are under `releases` -  so you can see that my PR is at least working for me
