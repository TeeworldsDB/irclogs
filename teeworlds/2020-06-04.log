02:01 < FrozenFox> heinrich5991, lus3r: When you "run an ELF" you're invoking an interpreter - the libc - with your ELF binary. The syntax error with the (, sounds like some linker/interpreter issue.
02:01 < FrozenFox> This thread; https://forum.nasm.us/index.php?topic=1504.0
02:02 < FrozenFox> was resolved by specifying an openbsd specific option in the linker. ld -m elf_i386_obsd ..
02:05 < FrozenFox> Er, the interpreter isn't libc, but is usually specialized per libc. IIUC.
10:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The kernel is the one interpreting the ELF in most cases, the kernel sets up the memory as requested by the file, it loads the sections in and jumps to the entry point of the elf binary (on most *nixes _libc_start_main). That's where the libc starts to set the environment up for C. For this to be a libc issue BSDs would have to be doing something very different while loading this as it's the kernel that seems to give up on loading 
19:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Hey, I did some testing about the problem where my server/ddrace servers with ddnet7 mod doesnt find the master server.
19:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> The problem is, that after a rcon login OR on the ddrace servers after a mapchange/vote to another difficulty, the server doenst find the master servers anymore. These actions cause high traffic I believe, because many rcon commands/ many votes are sent to the clients. At this point the server doesnt find, and wont anymore find any masters.
19:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> For 0.6 masters it works, my server that supports 0.7 and 0.6 it works for 0.6 master.
19:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> So I guess the 0.7 master is "broken"?
19:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Also, DDNet servers on 0.6 have the same amount of votes and rcon commands, even more, and there it always worked
20:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> someone running ddnet7 servers actually sent a packet dump to me
20:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it seemed that the tokens for the master server are no longer being generated correctly, they were all just 1 byte large (should be 4 bytes)
20:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> with this, you could try looking into the debugger, or look into your own packet dumps to see if you are affected by the same problem
20:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dezarion#5959 did some research too, I told him to join this channel. Could you give him the two way role, so he can give some information here?
20:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Dezarion should be able to send messages to this channel
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Perfect, thanks
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dezarion, read the last few messages, beginning with mine
20:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dezarion> @fokkonaut  Let me know if you've got the same results in your packet dumps
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I cant check it, I thibk
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but you should be able to work with what you have/heinrich provided
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991, it should be a 0.7 master problem, right?
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it looked like the server sends one-byte tokens
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but the tokens the server sends should be four bytes
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so it looked like a server problem
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> And why does it start sending 1 byte tokens?
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> How can that happen?
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but I haven't seen the server in normal operation
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> try to debug the server. why does it spew out 1 byte tokens
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't know why it does that
20:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> does it the same before the issuse happens?
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't know, dezarion could send me a packet capture so I can check
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Dezarion could you send me a packet dump of the server in normal operation, preferably when you know it's currently registering (e.g. right at the start)
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dezarion> Sure thing, give me a few mins

21:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dezarion> masterproblem added for reference
22:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Where are the files?
22:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Why are they gone
