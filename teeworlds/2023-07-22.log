02:53 < arok^> very nice games but i think the chat like: "wtf" "whistle" "<3" hows this can use easier, my hammer hits when i chat this radio and i think its not normal. please.
09:05 < ChillerDragon> ?
13:52 < Flower> May I ask what situations can cause the server to be able to register with the master server, but the client cannot display it (IP connection can be used, and the server information is displayed normally)
14:29 < bridge_> <jxsl13> the server returns an ip list
14:29 < bridge_> <jxsl13> master server
14:30 < bridge_> <jxsl13> and your client tries to connect to all of those ips in order to fetch the server info
14:31 < bridge_> <jxsl13> your client failed to fetch the list because you may be too far away from that server or your connection to that server is bad.
14:32 < bridge_> <jxsl13> the server or some firewall might block udp traffic from specific regions as well
14:36 < bridge_> <jxsl13> iirc server info is tcp but connecting to a server is udp
14:36 < bridge_> <jxsl13> traffic
14:46 < ChillerDragon> he already left before you answered lol
14:46 < bridge_> <jxsl13> (Y)
14:46 < ChillerDragon> also pretty sure masterserver stuff is udp
14:46 < ChillerDragon> ddnet http masters are tcp
14:46 < bridge_> <jxsl13> ok
14:53 < Flower> After testing several times, I found that the server can be displayed in the server list of Teeworlds, but not in the HTTP server list of DDNet, I think the server should have been intercepted by DDNet's firewall (the server is in China)
14:54 < bridge_> <jxsl13> wasn't ddnet more of being http?
17:01 < arok^> ChillerDragon: i meant emoticon, now i see i dont need click the bubble. ty. 
19:23 < ChillerDragon> ye just hover over it
21:02 < arok^> yep. is there some way get more sensitivity? i have max settings.
21:03 < bridge_> <jxsl13> f1
21:03 < bridge_> <jxsl13> inp_mousesens
21:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> remember the value that's returned
21:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> and then increase it by setting a new value
21:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> inp_mousesens value
21:06 < ChillerDragon> yea in the console your can set higher values than in the menu
21:11 < arok^> ofc. ty
