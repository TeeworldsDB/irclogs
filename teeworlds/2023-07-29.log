12:02 < ChillerDragon> Is the master super slow? Or has it always been like that? It took 20 seconds to load 100%. My connection is not blazingly fast but still that seems slow
12:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> insert a coin for **blazingly fast master servers**
12:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> the master is not involved with the actual server info
12:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: it's probably just that the client pings each server individually
12:36 < ChillerDragon> Im not sure but wasnt that instant at some point? Its not like there are soo many servers now
12:36 < ChillerDragon> maybe im just spoiled by ddnet http master
12:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it was never instant, no
12:37 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> yes, you seem to be spoiled
12:37 < ChillerDragon> hmk
12:43 < ChillerDragon> i remember it going to 90% quite fast but maybe thats just my current connection
12:43 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1690624973.png
12:43 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I think it's mostly influenced by ping to the individual servers
12:44 < ChillerDragon> a slow server should not block fast ones tho right?
12:44 < ChillerDragon> so only the slow ones appear last
12:45 < bridge_> <jxsl13> si
12:45 < ChillerDragon> omg so pinging my own netcup vps takes 20 seconds?
12:45 < ChillerDragon> doubt
12:45 < ChillerDragon> because connecting to it is instant
12:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> a couple of slow servers will block fast ones
12:46 < ChillerDragon> a
12:46 < bridge_> <jxsl13> :0
12:46 < ChillerDragon> epic denial of service
12:46 < ChillerDragon> register slow servers
12:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> because there can be a maximum of some config variables outstanding
12:46 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> register servers that don't answer
12:46 < ChillerDragon> or that
12:47 < ChillerDragon> could probably do some smart sorting based on reply times
12:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> by remembering reply times?
12:47 < ChillerDragon> yes
12:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> just do the https masterserver at that point ^^
12:47 < ChillerDragon> sure
