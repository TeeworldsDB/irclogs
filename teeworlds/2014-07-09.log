14:09 < PsychoGod> hey guys, have some questions...
14:10 <@matricks> hehehe
14:10 < PsychoGod> xD
14:10 < PsychoGod> i made joystick's support
14:10 <@matricks> you have reached your question quota for this year, come back next year
14:11 < PsychoGod> PsychoGod.TimeTravelYear(+1);

14:12 < PsychoGod> like this
14:12 <@matricks> welcome to pc hardware
14:13 < PsychoGod> thx, i play with joystick's and it's funny xD today question isn't about code :)
14:14 < PsychoGod> i have joystick with 2 analog sticks, and it's n1ce to move and fire with that, but some of joysticks, don't have sticks
14:14 < PsychoGod> so what do you think about some sort of easy lvl aim for fire with button ?
14:15 <@matricks> huh? autoaim?
14:15 <@matricks> I would just call joysticks without analogsticks unsupported
14:15 <@matricks> the game isn't built for it
14:15 <@matricks> I tried a dpad implementation on GBA wayback, doesn't really feel that nice
14:16 <@matricks> analogsticks works quite good however
14:17 < PsychoGod> i have this one

14:17 <@matricks> looks horrible
14:18 < PsychoGod> it's unusual but funny and by playing you can skill up your moves and fire :)

14:20 <@matricks> but no, I wouldn't impelemnt something specific for non-analog joysticks/gamepads
14:21 < PsychoGod> yeah, i know, i made it for TDTW, but would it be official trusted with low skill aim with joystick ? (ofcource without sources in public)
14:21 <@matricks> rephrase
14:23 < PsychoGod> if i would include low skill aim for joystick, and then release it for public in TDTW Client Mod, would it be off trusted ? or client would be in "black list"?
14:23 <@matricks> black list, it's an aimbot
14:24 < PsychoGod> ok, that's what i think about it too, so wouldn't do that :)
14:24 <@matricks> just ignore digital only gamepads
14:25 < PsychoGod> ok, thx for answer
18:46 < nameless_tee50> How do you change logo names?
18:47  * nameless_tee50 slaps hanyuu around a bit with a large fishbot
