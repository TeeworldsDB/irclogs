16:04 < Obani> gctf, race, boomfng
16:05 < Obani> My top is : infclass, openfng/boomfng, cstt, zcatch and cstt
16:06 < Obani> Winnie, funniest might be infclass
16:19 < Winnie> how can i get these? :)
16:19 < Winnie> Thanks for answering :)
16:21 <@heinrich5991> you can probably find information for most of the mods in the official forums, e.g. https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=7868 for openfng
16:40 < fatcat> hi
16:41 <@heinrich5991> hi
16:41 < fatcat> I'm trying to setup upTee right now. as soon as I'm supposed to use the manage.py "script" I started running into errors... as far as I can tell django chaned some intern variable names.django.core.exceptions."ImproperlyConfigured: You must add the "admin_tools.template_loaders.Loader" template loader to your TEMPLATE_LOADERS settings variable"
16:41 < fatcat> I also tested this with the examole config in the docs
16:44 <@heinrich5991> do you have a link for that uptee stuff?
16:44 < fatcat> https://github.com/upTee/upTee
16:44 < fatcat> https://github.com/upTee/upTee/blob/master/docs/production_server.md
16:46 < Obani> Winnie, this is a cool client https://github.com/Siile/Goreworlds
16:46 < Obani> It contains dm++ and tdm++
16:47 < Obani> Also https://github.com/Siile : there you can find kf and cstt
16:47 < Obani> Winnie, https://github.com/necropotame/teeworlds-infclass/ here you can find infection class
16:47 < Obani> But you can also have them on the forum ^^
16:48 <@heinrich5991> fatcat: have you tried setting up the development setup first? that might be easier
16:48 < fatcat> nope
16:48 < fatcat> but I've got no idea why it should be easier... but ok
16:49 <@heinrich5991> I don't know, I'm just guessing
16:49 <@heinrich5991> trying the development version right now
16:50 < Winnie> Thanks, have you the normal ddrace mod?
16:50 < fatcat> it isn't any easier... the development setup guide is just not as long...
16:50 < fatcat> it's only minimal diffrences
16:50 < fatcat> *"minimal"
16:51 <@heinrich5991> ok
16:51 <@heinrich5991> then stay with the prod. setup I guess, I can reproduce your error with the dev setup
16:51 < fatcat> ok
16:52 <@heinrich5991> Winnie: https://ddnet.tw/ is the "normal" ddrace mod of today
16:53 < Winnie> oh okay, now i will try hosting a server with these mod
17:01 <@heinrich5991> http://django-admin-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html#configuration
17:01 <@heinrich5991> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/upgrading/
17:02 < fatcat> heinrich5991: you know a bit about django?
17:02 <@heinrich5991> only a tiny little bit
17:02 < fatcat> ohh...
17:02 <@heinrich5991> (that's the only stuff I found with some quick googling)
17:03 < fatcat> :)
17:10 < fatcat> heinrich5991: could you please be so kind and look into it? I've got no idea what exaclt is causing the issue
17:11 <@heinrich5991> it looks like the upgrade to django 1.8 caused this issue
17:11 <@heinrich5991> I tried installing django 1.7 instead, but that didn't seem resolve the issue
17:11 < fatcat> can I downgrade django? and jsut open a issue and let the dev deal with it? :)
17:11 <@heinrich5991> can't debug this issue furtherly right now, need to leave soon
17:11 < fatcat> ok
17:11 < fatcat> thanks
17:12 <@heinrich5991> opening an issue is certainly a good idea
17:12 <@heinrich5991> (on the upTee bug tracker, that is)
17:13 < fatcat> yep
17:18 < Winnie> was ist vanilla antispoof?
17:19 < fatcat> issue opened
17:20 <@matricks> minus: o/
17:21 <@minus> que pasa
17:21 <@matricks> una cervera por favor
17:21 <@matricks> or how you know spell it
17:21 <@minus> si se√±or
17:21 <@matricks> gracias
17:21 <@matricks> thats about all the spanish I know
17:21 <@minus> cerveca iirc
17:22 <@matricks> and I'm going colombia in a couple of weeks :D
17:22 <@matricks> minus: btw, been flying again
17:26 < Obani> teeworlds trailer is better on Steam
17:26 < Obani> why ?
18:39 < Edible> i wonder that now that tw is on steam if theres a bigger chance that nintendo/hal will sue matricks over likeness
18:39 < Edible> cerveza
18:40 <@matricks> why?
18:40 < Edible> Obani, all the steam makes your glasses look blurry and thus better
18:40 <@minus> ah, z, that's what it was
18:40 < Edible> tees look a bit like kirby
18:40 <@matricks> pfft, kirby came out after the tee was designed
18:41 < Edible> dont pronounce the z like the spanish do in colombia though
18:41 < Edible> 1992?
18:41 <@minus> sue nintendo!
18:41 <@matricks> Edible: yeah
18:42 < Edible> what? when was tw designed?
18:42 <@matricks> tw was done some time around ... like.. 2003?
18:42 < Edible> dang you're old mat
18:42 < Edible> :P
18:42 <@matricks> but the tee comes from an old band logo that teetow did
18:43 < Edible> wow so it took you 10 years to make it?
18:43 <@matricks> teewars/teeworlds has existed in many different incarnations
18:43 < Edible> and here i am thinking i suck as a prog because it takes me a day minimum to do anything
18:43 < Edible> oh alright
18:44 <@matricks> http://matricks.se/tw/teewars.png
18:44 <@matricks> thats one
18:44 <@matricks> http://matricks.se/tw/teewars_uber_hooking.avi
18:44 <@matricks> thats another one
18:44 < Edible> hopefully they wont, and if they do, who can they sue... plus you cant have such a simplistic design "round ball with eyes" and say nobody gets to draw something like that
18:45 <@matricks> just change it to a yellow smily face.. done
18:46 < Edible> alright :)
