19:21 <@minus> i would /love/ to know why firefox freezes when loading github
20:03 < heinrich5991> minus: your bam.lua landed \o/
20:04  * minus buckles up
20:04 <@minus> someone should finish that forum post then
20:10 < heinrich5991> which forum post? :)
20:16 <@minus> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10187 this one
20:18 <@minus> will do that later, now: sword stories
20:18 < heinrich5991> hehe
20:25 < BeaR_> Io, someone knows how to build the trunk on windows as the libs had been removed?
20:27 < Oy> put in the stuff yourself
20:28 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: what's missing?
20:30 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: freetype/dl shared libs and the include files had been removed
20:34 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: after some googling it seems to be that there are no up-to-date windows binaries available
20:34 < heinrich5991> you could however get the ones from the gnome project:
20:34 < heinrich5991> http://win32builder.gnome.org/packages/3.6/freetype_2.4.11-1_win32.zip
20:35 < heinrich5991> minus: could we host our own freetype windows binaries?
20:35 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: from the page http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php
20:35 < BeaR_> thx (:
20:37 <@minus> heinrich5991: sure thing
20:39 < Oy> take the stuff from here https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/tree/2c4775cf5a328448ff3e81ebf781bc9fedc4f45c/other ;)
