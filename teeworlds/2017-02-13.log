21:07 < Henningstone> does anyone have a clue what this void *pFontSetV argument in TextRender()->Text is/was for? As far as I can see it's not even being used at all
21:29 < Learath2> Henningstone: git blame says it belongs to matricks maybe he still remembers... but you are correct its not used
21:40 < Henningstone> git blame was a good idea, looking at the commit where the text.cpp was introduced told me that it wasn't even used back then :o
