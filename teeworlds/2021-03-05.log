09:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> one may design maps where you cannot avoid water, which imo is cool, but from my SuperMario64 water levels trauma, I'd avoid such maps.
09:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but a nice feature to be used everywhere else.
09:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> like mods
12:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> I've had only one map in mind that is predominantly based around water and where flag cannot be captured without going underwater, but only one. For the rest (in my opinion at least), it should play a rather minor role
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 0.5 Pirates ictf!
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> with doors
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> where are our doors
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> perhaps one day we will get beloved doors
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm
22:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lookimg at Zatline's video, I'm kinda wondering. A Tee's movement gets sluggish underwater, pistol projectiles are as smoothly fast as everywhere?
22:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> looking*
22:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> huh? do you mean whether pistol projectiles get slowed down in water?
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yes
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> all projectiles are slowed down in water
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> laser as well?
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if not, good
22:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> laser is a whole another case, it's got less range and gets refracted when entering/leaving water
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> oof, nice
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I love the snorkel or however it's written
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> super cute :D
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> ninja is rendered basically useless atm. and hammer remains mostly unchanged (my attempts at slowing it down were... not quite successful)
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> slower ninja maybe?
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> shorter ninja jumps?
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> yeah, that's why it is useless
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> underwater slasbing waves
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> you travel less due to the friction with it, so it's more of a liability (which it already kinda is, if you are against people who know how to act against ninjas)
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> slashing
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> woukd be funny if they could create when attacking at the end of their attack a wave that travels some distance and damages anything it hits with having half the damage with every continuous hit. just an idea.
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> making ninja worth using underwater
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> sounds like an unique take on the matter
