10:28 < Kottizen> ChillerDragon: I'm a little late here, but verifying the domain on Github doesn't sound like a bad idea!
11:02 < ChillerDragon> yay yea I think it looks kinda professional and if we already pay for the domain we can also use it
11:02 < ChillerDragon> So are you able to do so Kottizen ? I have no clue who has which access
12:20 < Dune> I don't know if it is useful in any way. We can do it at any point anyway, as long as we control the mail 
14:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @Robyt3 join discord: discord.gg/teeworlds
14:16 < Dune> he's not here...
14:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> gotta send this every 10 seconds
14:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might reach him one day
14:24 < Dune> Yeah, don't 
14:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ðŸ˜„
14:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> that black flash when starting never occured on my end
14:25 < Dune> Interesting 
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> check my comment i've posted videos there
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://streamable.com/orqmqy
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://streamable.com/asvokk
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> could be related with how they are built
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix did you build the 0.7.5 one or did you download it?
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> 0.7.5 is downloaded, the other is the one built on github
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> is the PR
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> built on github
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Can you compare with a previous github build?
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> no need for a video, just check that it has the same behaviour as 0.7.5
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> gonna dl master
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/actions/runs/92928281
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah same behaviour as 0.7.5
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> also shadow corners in the menu got changed just noticed
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> since 0.7.5 probably
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> "shadow" corners?
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> corner radius mismatch ðŸ˜®

18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 87 players :)
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> wow
18:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ^^
18:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 88 right now, its the new record :D
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 91 record xd
19:34 < ChillerDragon> fokkonaut btw when I delete all the accounts the master registration works fine
19:34 < ChillerDragon> see test server
19:35 < ChillerDragon> Can I draw a image and change alpha ? https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/5q
19:38 < ChillerDragon> Graphics()->SetColor(1,1,1,0.5); // did the job
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon i will take a look
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon you need to pre calculate the alpha for r g b too
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon but removing accounts doesnt make sense? There is nothing to update for accounts when logging in to rcon
21:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Mr_Anderson @MrCosmo status.tw shows wrong time for "last seen" for a server. Currently for example for my server it says 7:12 pm. It shows the current time minus 2 hours for some reason
21:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Probably also for first seen, but I cant check that
21:15 < minus> maybe it's just the wrong time zone?
21:16 < Dune> sounds likely
21:16 < minus> it's rendered on the server and in UTC
21:16 < minus> probably should add tz info there
21:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Well I live in Germany and it should be a german website
22:20 < minus> that's not how the internet works
22:20 < minus> though it's possible to render the time with js, in which case it'll use the browser's timezone
