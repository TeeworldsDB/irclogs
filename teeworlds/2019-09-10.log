01:38 <@Dune> the --debug-nodes option is still in bam \o/
11:14 <@Dune> koomi, much love for --debug-nodes-html <3
11:38 < koomi> glad you like it, although I'm not sure what I have to do with it :D
11:50 <@Dune> nvm then :)
18:05 <@Dune> hmm
18:05 <@Dune> how big of a deal is it to know where the flagger is in competitive ctf (not ctf5)?
18:05 <@Dune> all maps are narrow enough that you just meet the flagger by going left, right? except ctf2 where you have to spin around a bit
18:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Hey oy, i checked which packages are incoming for the client, and there are only the normal ones, and not too many, if raiinbow is on ofc it spams the skinchange msg then, but still, why is it overloading the server buffer with around 7 people?
18:29 <@Dune> oy is not here, you should check on irc before
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oh
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Do you have an idea why the buffer is filling?
21:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> "how big of a deal is it to know where the flagger is " -> Not at all, vanilla players will get used to it and new players will explore the map
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the flag, not the flagger
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I mean the flagger, not the flag spot
21:16 < Oy> some indicator would kill the fun
21:18 < Oy> Dune: there're probably more dead issues buried in there :)
21:19 <@Dune> there are yeah
21:19 <@Dune> just about everything that isn't labelled
21:20 <@Dune> what in https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1851 should be done?
21:20 <@Dune> I guess the three last bullet points are okay, not too important though
21:24 < Oy> copy is still missing right?
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
21:25 < Oy> yeah these 3 bullet points can be done, but not a must have :)
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oy, could you help with the rainbow? I still couldnt get it. Looked what the client receives and yea its all normal over there
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> why is the buffer overloading?
21:28 <@Dune> Oy: yes but it's https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/12
21:38 < Oy> Dune: yeah
21:38 < Oy> fokkonaut, some other time, when i have more time
21:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Okay :)
