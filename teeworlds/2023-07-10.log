17:03 < bridge_> <slayer5003> But from my personal experience, most people would just run Steam and install games over there. Thanks to Proton/Wine you can run many, many games, even those that weren't developed for Linux. (Wine, Lutrix etc. would do equally good, but I think Steam is meta)

17:10 < bridge_> <slayer5003> Many people are amazed, how many games run on Linux just fine. Mostly AAA games won't run due to stupid DRM, custom launcher or crazy graphics code. It would be rather odd if Teeworlds wouldn't work.

17:10 < bridge_> <jxsl13> random thought: slay
17:11 < bridge_> <d_une> it often comes with a degraded performance in my experience, because it is not native
17:12 < bridge_> <d_une> teeworlds is native, naturally
17:15 < bridge_> <slayer5003> True. Though mostly an issue when playing on potato-computer, or 144 hz, or 4k+. (Since modern AAA games won't run anyway, and older games or indie games usually have lower requirements.)
17:15 < bridge_> <d_une> so you need oversized architecture for what you're trying to run, or to undershoot your fps
17:15 < bridge_> <d_une> many non-AAA games have terrible optimization and still require a lot of performance
17:17 < bridge_> <slayer5003> Most gaming pc are oversized, that doesn't really matter nowadays. Minecraft is one of the most popular games. You can play it on a Raspberry Pi, no need for 8 core/16 threads CPU and RTX gpu.
17:17 < bridge_> <slayer5003> Still, many people own them. Just to play Among Us.
22:17 < bridge_> <Алексей Песорин> > in fact, when you open the ubuntu store, teeworlds was on the front of it for a good while. there aren't so many games straight up developed with that platform in mind
22:17 < bridge_> <Алексей Песорин> 
22:17 < bridge_> <Алексей Песорин> Ubuntu Snap Store is bloat that slows down your system and applications running inside it's "jail" significantly. Consider completely disabling it using preferences.d and moving to APT 🤓 
22:17 < bridge_> <Алексей Песорин> But yeah, the only *good* games I know developed for Linux in particular are Teeworlds and SuperTuxKart. But as the community is growing, there might be some other titles being developed. Who knows?
22:18 < bridge_> <d_une> Hedgewars is pretty good and is easier to build on Linux than Windows
22:19 < bridge_> <Алексей Песорин> Ohhhh
22:19 < bridge_> <Алексей Песорин> Hedgewars the Worms clone
22:19 < bridge_> <Алексей Песорин> Almost forgot about that
22:19 < bridge_> <Алексей Песорин> But yeah
22:21 < bridge_> <d_une> they've done a very good job with consistent development and released 1.0 a few years ago :)
22:21 < bridge_> <Алексей Песорин> nice
