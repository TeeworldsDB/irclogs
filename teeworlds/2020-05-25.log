20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> Is there smth like a Sleeper?
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ?
21:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> I mean like Sleep(5) that the server wait actually 5 sec until he send the msg
21:08 < Oy> you have to modify the src for that
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> (and it's not very trivial as the server is single threaded there is no clear place to accomodate for this)
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You can usually use just a saved time and a if stmt in Tick to check whether it's time to send yet
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Trafalgar Law there's crapnet which might do something related to what you want
23:03 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> wtf's up with teeworlds just now?  the global list, it loads slow, then wont show.  just me?
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> server list works fine for me
