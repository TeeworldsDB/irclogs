11:13 < BotoX> I love russians
11:14 <@matricks> blank gif?
11:14 < BotoX> huh
11:14 < BotoX> It's not blank for me
11:14 < BotoX> maybe on white background
11:14 <@matricks> lol
11:14 < BotoX> my firefox background is dark, that's probably why I can see it, heh.
11:15 < BotoX> time to brick my BIOS
11:15 <@matricks> I hacked in a background :)
11:15 <@matricks> ...
11:15 <@matricks> so.. whats up with that picture?
11:15 < BotoX> It's cool, and I want to use it as my BIOS splashscreen
11:15 <@matricks> normal shitty auto picture -> ascii
11:15 < BotoX> like this guy: http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQbWdTLHfGHn49kcOEkIItkea-5SjwPfAYoqXI8ucidVykrr6Wv
11:16 < BotoX> thing is that I can't find the original picture
11:16 < BotoX> So I can't make an ASCII out of it
11:16 <@matricks> whats so special about htat picture?
11:17 < BotoX> probably nothing at all
11:17 < BotoX> it's just that I really like it
11:17 < BotoX> for some reason...

11:33 <@matricks> why change splash.. you never see it anyway :)
11:34 < BotoX> I see it for nearly a second when I turn it on! :3
11:34 < BotoX> And imagine if someone steals it
11:51 <@minus> matricks: don't say that, BIOS takes 17 seconds here
11:52 < BotoX> how do you like it, minus :>

15:47 <@matricks> [13:47:33] minus: keep working it :)
15:47 <@minus> [13:47:53] is it luck?
15:47 <@minus> [13:48:10] or can you prove that there always is a solution
15:47 <@matricks> [13:48:29] dunno if there is always a solution
15:47 <@matricks> [13:48:52] you can develop a system that works really well
15:47 <@matricks> [13:48:58] I can easily get to 1024
15:47 <@matricks> [13:49:34] I could probably refine the algorithm a little bit to get to 2048, 100% of the time
15:47 <@minus> [13:51:19] i dun know of no algorithm
15:47 <@matricks> [13:52:06] well, you kinda have to develop one :)

15:47 <@matricks> [13:55:58] hehe
15:47 <@matricks> [13:56:15] took me about 5 tries to get to 2048
15:47 <@matricks> [13:56:34] you can get about 3200 points bu pressing, up,left,down,right and repeat
