15:51 < Socialdarwinist> heinrich5991: Is it possible to add a server to the master server list with an IPv6 address? I donâ€™t see any IPv6 servers in the list currently.
17:11 <@minus> Socialdarwinist: masters are not reachable via IPv6, so no
17:17 < Socialdarwinist> minus I thought that maybe one could send the IPv6 over IPv4 additionally to the IPv4.
17:18 <@minus> it uses your connecting address, so that won't work
17:19 <@minus> we had IPv6 enabled for a short while a few years ago and like half the servers disappeared
17:22 < Socialdarwinist> minus You mean it has been discarded for lack of usage by servers?
17:23 <@minus> no, servers (and/or clients?) tried to use ipv6 although having no connectivity
17:23 < Socialdarwinist> Hm, how is this possible? Sounds contradictory.
17:27 < koomi> server not listening on ipv6 but connection to master server is via v6?
17:27 < Socialdarwinist> Yep, exactly. Sounds gainsaying.
17:29 < koomi> if listening on v6 has to be explicitly enabled in the config it's not very surprising if noone does
20:48 < Stitch626> i've tested IPv6 with teeworlds just a few monts ago, result was you cannot even connect
20:49 < Stitch626> both had a public and pingable ip v6 adress but connection was impossible. we've also tested a http server which worked like a charm
20:49 < Stitch626> also tested to manually bind client and server to ipv6 which didnt helped at all
20:49 < Stitch626> so i would say current support state of ipv6 is useless
21:02 <@minus> pretty much
21:02 <@minus> pay me for a couple of days and i'll come up with a fix
21:05 <@minus> in fact, we could do that. there's still a bunch of donations left that could be used for bounties on bugs/issues. someone would just have to manage that
21:07 < EastByte> the PR accept will cost extra, though
