08:16 < ChillerDragon> idk how much you guys see twice now i use irc as source of truth. But half of my matrix messages do not arrive here .-.
14:32 < minus> matrix is a dumpster fire after all
14:36 < ChillerDragon> yes!
14:37 < ChillerDragon> heinrich once asked me to use matrix instead of irc. I responded with it bugs. And he asked wat bugs. So i am sending him all the bugs now :D
14:37 < bridge> <lukure> Just a tip, use discord
14:37 < minus> discord is also a dumpster fire but for different reasons
