14:08 < Learath2> I'm thinking of getting autocompletion in console commands, however the console is agnostic to the server and client
14:09 < Learath2> Can anyone think of a good way to let the console autocomplete client names without tying the console to the client and the server?
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Learath2: lots of components are tied to the client in Teeworlds, the console is one of the few...
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't see a good way tbh
15:14 < Learath2> Dune: are you perchance familiar with the text rendering?
15:21 < Learath2> or anyone else ^^
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Learath2: add a new parameter type, let the engine feed possible completions
15:30 < Learath2> heinrich5991: are you perchance familiar with the text rendering code? :P
15:31 <@heinrich5991> not at all
15:53 < Learath2> Help me truncate text for gods sake
16:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @LordSk touched text rendering a bit
16:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune bester mann
16:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ?
16:59 < Learath2> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2479/commits/60fbcf94e5
17:00 < Learath2> This is the best I could come up with, could be merged I guess
19:20 < Dune> Learath2, almost certain that's the way it's done in Teeworlds in other places
20:23 < Learath2> It'd be nice if we could ... it
21:10 < Dune> sorry?
