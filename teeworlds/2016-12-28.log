11:08 < namelesstee> Hey is there any coder people here?
11:08 < namelesstee> i would like to know if i can stop my servers trying to use master3 because its dead 
11:09 < namelesstee> i tried deleting it from masters.cfg but it writes it back again
11:12 <@minus> echo 0.0.0.0 master3.teeworlds.com >> /etc/hosts
11:12 <@minus> though if it's dead the server won't use it anyway
11:14 < namelesstee> my server says this
11:14 < namelesstee> [16-12-28 11:12:40][register]: chose 'master3.teeworlds.com' as master, sending heartbeats [16-12-28 11:13:40][register]: WARNING: Master server is not responding, switching master [16-12-28 11:13:41][engine/mastersrv]: refreshing master server addresses
11:14 < namelesstee> it keeps doing it
11:18 <+necropotame> It's a normal behavior. Why do you want to change this? It's something that should be fixed on the master server, not each server
11:25 < namelesstee> i just want players to be able to find the servers master 3 been down for 2 days
