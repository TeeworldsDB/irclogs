02:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> this bug can happen when spawn tiles are blocked/dont exist, or when the tee isnt snapped to u correctly, or in .7 when health/ammo are zero
02:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> there are probably other causes but those are the three ive seen
08:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The ddnet servers are a bit of an experiment for now, if you get any of these issues ping me
