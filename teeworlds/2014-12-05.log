00:23 < TeaTowel> SOOO dead here.
07:07 < guest_> Hi, DDoS attacks are becoming really boring.
07:07 < guest_> Does someone have good iptables rules to protect against attacks on teeworlds UDP ports?
07:30 <@minus> well, that ain't gonna help with DDoS
07:33 < guest_> do you have other solution?
07:38 <@minus> don't get DDoSed :D
07:45 < guest_> I'm stupid, I should have thought of that earlier! XD
08:45 < laxa> afaik, the only thing you can do is get a ddos protected host :(
