09:07 < day> Dune: woa theres controller support in tw now?
09:53 < minus> oh?
09:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2047 day
10:15 < day> single joystick support? why
10:15 < day> i guess i can now play teeworlds with a steering wheel :|
10:16 < day> paddle shifters for shooting and hooking. brake and clutch for A and D :3
10:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Huh? You play with two gamepads?
14:26 < day> Dune: well joystick means to me "two axis". If you use a xbox360 controller you would have 5 or 6 axis on 4 sticks/levers
14:27 < day> but after thinking about it for a while, i  dont think the xbox360 controller would be good for teeworlds. movement and aim would probably be ok. but shooting/weapon switching would be a pita
14:28 < day> using the levers to shoot would be ergonomical, but annoying (because they are analog, and have a long travel distance). if you use a thumb button to shoot, weapon switching becomes tricky
14:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't have any experience with controllers :| But yeah two axis supported, not sure what kind of configuration would be ideal for teeworlds
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Need to make an UI for axis selection
18:25 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/mectbCX.png got my teeworlds build broken somehow, it's very strange, git status shows no difference with master and I cleaned the data folder
18:26 <@Dune> a new clone solved it but still, weird
18:26 < day> the arrows scream *convert me into a dance dance revolution game* :^)
18:27 <@Dune> we already have joystick support for that :^)
18:42 < minus> hm
18:43 < minus> lemme try how bad it is
18:47 < Oy> Dune: did you rebuild it? was it still broken?
18:47 <@Dune> yeah
18:47 <@Dune> bam -c and all
18:48 <@heinrich5991> looks like outdated data maybe?
18:48 <@Dune> I copied the data folder on a clean working teeworlds and the bug didn't happen again, heinrich5991
18:48 <@Dune> and getting a clean data folder didn't fix either
18:48 <@heinrich5991> hm okay
18:48 <@Dune> several weird things happening recently, the only reasons I could foresee are cmake and a change with libc
18:49 <@Dune> I am unable to compile https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2039/ too
18:49 <@Dune> I get src/game/client/components/notifications.cpp:57:44: error: ‘IMAGE_SOUNDICONS’ 
18:49 <@Dune> even though build/src/generated/client_data.h has it...
18:50 < minus> joystick: works: yes, playable: hell no
18:52 <@Dune> it's the tradeoff to play from the couch
18:52 <@Dune> it was probably a mistake to use bam and cmake on the same repo :(
18:53 <@heinrich5991> I haven't run into problems yet
18:54 <@heinrich5991> Dune: do you use a subdirectory for cmake building?
18:54 <@Dune> no
18:54 <@Dune> I cmake . at teeworlds/
18:54 <@heinrich5991> hm okay
18:54 <@heinrich5991> that's a difference in our setups then
18:54 <@Dune> maybe it's not that
18:55 <@heinrich5991> do you execute the teeworlds executable from bam from the directory it's created in?
18:55 <@Dune> yes, always
18:56 <@heinrich5991> regarding "You could check if the client version is older than 0.7.3 and then skip sending the sha256"
18:56 <@Dune> wait, where is the src/generated supposed to be in, in teeworlds/ or in teeworlds/build? I have it at both places
18:56 <@heinrich5991> ah, there's your interference between cmake and bam
18:56 <@Dune> sigh
18:57 <@heinrich5991> I guess you should execute cmake in a subdirectory
18:57 <@Dune> alright
18:57 <@heinrich5991> regarding "You could check if the client version is older than 0.7.3 and then skip sending the sha256"
18:58 <@heinrich5991> since it's a backwards-compatible extension, I'd rather send it at all times — it doesn't interfere with older clients and makes the code simpler
18:58 <@heinrich5991> Oy: ^ (fixed the rest of the comments locally, already)
19:00 < Oy> well yeah, it's not that much data. so it doesn't matter much if you send it to clients that can't handle it :)
19:00 < Oy> but would be just a simple check ;)
19:01 <@Dune> wouldn't that make testing a bit tricky since we haven't upp'd to 0.7.3 yet? or have we?
19:01 <@Dune> ah #define CLIENT_VERSION 0x0703
19:02 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1018
19:02 < Oy> already used it there
19:03 <@heinrich5991> even there, I mean we generally assume that people will update to the newest version anyway
19:04 <@heinrich5991> so this is mostly code complexity vs the extra bytes you send for people who haven't yet updated their clients
19:04 <@heinrich5991> hmmm
19:04 < minus> doesn't cmake discourage in-source builds?
19:09 < Brian> hey sup
19:10 <@heinrich5991> yes, it does
19:10 <@heinrich5991> hey
19:10 < Brian> ehrenmann
19:14 < minus> heh, made some polish kid ragequit
19:18 < minus> huh, i can't uncheck 'standard gametype' in the filter
19:18 <@Dune> with a joystick? huh
19:18 <@Dune> that's because it's in the "Teeworlds" filter
19:19 <@Dune> maybe it should be grayed out or something
19:19 < minus> nah, i gave up on joystick
19:19 <@Dune> is it bad because it's poorly implemented or because joystick sucks for teeworlds?
19:20 < minus> oh, that was terribly confusing
19:20  * Dune notes down
19:20 < minus> that doesn't even make any sense
19:20 <@Dune> Teeworlds is a special filter, has to stay pure
19:21 < minus> under 'All' that filter works just fine, but if you tick it you get exactly the same result as the 'Teeworlds' filter
19:21 <@Dune> yeah
19:21 < minus> you can't even move down 'Teeworlds'?
19:22 < minus> nice that you like vanilla teeworlds, but i'd prefer to decide what to play on my own
19:27 < Learath2> :P
19:34 <@Dune> wait, the map checker gets the pure maplist from the version server? explains why it was disabled
19:34 <@Dune> is it an issue that it uses CRC instead of SHA256, heinrich5991?
19:35 < minus> crc is almost trivial to fake
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> someone used the weakness once
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> idk what happend exactly but something happend abusing the weak crc
19:38 <@Dune> I'm talking about the mapchecker, @ChillerDragon 
19:38 < Oy> Dune: it was disabled cause standard maps were worked on
19:38 <@Dune> but the version server is not up to date I assume?
19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh oke sorri
19:38 < Oy> nope map checking isn't up to date
19:40 <@Dune> so this needs a versionsrv patch before release, or people can't play on standard maps
19:41 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/pvQWBPT.png
19:41 <@Dune> would be nice to get a higher res for that icon :/
19:41 < Oy> yeah
19:43 < Oy> the hashes need to be updated. clients have the actual hashes build in so 0.7.3 would use them and older ones don't use the feature anyway
19:44 <@Dune> > The version server has to be updated.
19:44 <@Dune> whoops, you mentioned that 15 days ago
