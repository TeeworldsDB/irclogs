00:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> operating system coukd not handle the truth and crashed?
00:01 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> ^
00:01 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> ok ima try the other way around
00:01 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> at least vim threw a warning  :p
00:02 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> oh jesus its harder to kill
00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nano the way to go
00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/hakluke/how-to-exit-vim/blob/master/README.md
00:02 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> lool
00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
00:03 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> i created a file when i cat it it writes stuff to my terminal on mouse click
00:03 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> bois vim > nano is crazy compared to nano > vim
00:03 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> i can highly recommend trying it :D
00:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I bet one way is: unplug your pc
00:03 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> it literally highjacks my mouse
00:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/hakluke/how-to-exit-vim/blob/master/README.md#the-hardware-way
00:03 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> after i killed the process
00:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> this is gold
00:04 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> vimkiller :D
00:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the ine above
00:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> one
00:04 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> not that nano is easy to quit^
00:04 < Dune> can't you use vim to do buffer overflows or forbidden accesses to memory
00:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ctrl+x ?
00:06 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> idk about forbidden access to memory i use vim to support kids in uganda
00:06 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> :D
00:06 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> ctrl+x+y+enter
00:06 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> vs
00:06 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> :x
00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> alias vim=/bin/false
00:08 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> dfq
00:09 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> alias fuck=sudo
00:09 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> fuck !!
00:09 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> runs last command as sudo :D
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I would call the "Docker Way" the Overengineered way
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there is a fuck tool
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that corrects typos
00:09 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> lol didnt know
00:10 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> could you send a link my research only showed porn lol
00:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck
00:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> too slow
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> "https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck"
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> eh
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> "fuck bash cli"
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> >:D
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> first search returned it
00:11 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> idk how to search
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's one of the skills one truly needs
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> learn it ðŸ˜‰
00:11 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> ye
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah
00:11 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> my search literally returned 100% porn
00:12 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> "fuck tool typos"
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's basically the only true skill a programmer needs
00:12 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> or maybe its my biased search :D
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe google knows your search history :0
00:12 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> lmao google
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> duckduck
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> aw, man
00:13 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> :)
00:13 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> but is it useful?
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> same story, different name
00:13 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> i mean is it faster to type fuck then look at the suggestion instead of uparrow and fixing it?
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> check out the gif in the readme
00:13 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> well duckduckgo shouldnt give me a biased search result as far as i know
00:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dunno, I am not using it
00:14 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> google bubble
00:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> porn bubble
00:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
00:14 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> :D
00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> rust
00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> back on track
00:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-333 could apply this kind of "background" rendering to layers in teeworlds
00:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think there are some heavily good people working on factorio :0 and their blog is super interesting
00:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> sadly don't understand it :'(
00:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> i think for tw it might be enough to cache the vertices on the gpu instead of a texture
00:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> won't that cost some vram though?
00:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if gpu performance is a concern at this point, so is vram?
00:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> well not the whole map but only some chunks around the current view
00:24 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> chunks for maps could be a thing too huh?
00:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> performance is not a problem ingame. but in the editor ðŸ˜„
00:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> not for the maps itself but for rendering maybe
00:24 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> i have the feeling that very big maps can make trouble
00:25 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> iirc last time i tried making a big map it crashed clients
00:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> right now we need to calc all vertices per frame and send them to the gpu
00:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> we could instead cache the vertices for chunks
00:27 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> the background scrolling seems to help with weak and integrated cpus
00:28 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> that might fix the raspi issue JewZeus mentioned
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> anybody knows the state of the raspberry gpu drivers?
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> they should have enough power to run tw but maybe the driver is the problem
13:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Any opinions on inlining dbg_break dbg_assert and so on? By using a macro or something. Because when i reach a break i want to use gdb to look at the variable scope from the function that called dbg_assert and not at the function scope of dbg_break
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `up`
16:48 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> redix, good thought, I don't know but I'll try to look into it
21:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon `up`
21:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that is, use the up command
21:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in gdb
21:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ah thanks ðŸ™‚
22:09 < Learath2> Do we have a way to truncate text in the teeworlds source?
22:09 < Learath2> turns out you can send chat commands with pretty long help texts and it wontfit
22:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> truncate in what way? in rendering?
22:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> for the strings themselves, we do have `str_truncate`, I think
22:13 < Learath2> Hmm, I just need to estimate how many characters can fit in that space then str_truncate to that I guess
22:15 < Learath2> hmm str_truncate just cuts it off, I guess I need a str_truncate_with
23:06 < Dune> do you know when ipv6 support was introduced in teeworlds? 0.7?
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i guess
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i cant remember seeing v6 in 0.6
23:11 < Dune> i see issues from 2010
23:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no, 0.6 could do ipv6
23:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it lacks proper dualstack support though
23:16 <@heinrich5991> for servers registering at the masters, that is
23:17 <@heinrich5991> they can't register as both ipv4 and ipv6 at the same time
23:17 < Dune> thanks
23:18 < Dune> do you know how the ipv4/ipv6 detection works? I see net_addr_from_str sets 		addr->type = NETTYPE_IPV4;  but it never sets IPV6
23:22 <@heinrich5991> the branch labeld /* ipv6 */ does the ipv6 reading
23:23 <@heinrich5991> it requires the address to be put into [] brackets and delegates the parsing to the OS-specific functions, calling sockaddr_to_netaddr to get the NETADDR (with NETTYPE_IPV6)
23:25 < Dune> I see, thanks for the detail
23:29 < rand> JewZeus: about your idea, I usually play CTF by rushing and running, either chasing the flag carrier or carrying the flag, I get a high score thanks to flag captures but my K/D ratio is < 1 (so is my average killing streak)
23:30 < rand> I can outrun any new player while being harmless
23:33 < rand> as far as I understand, I feel I'll get a bonus while playing with at least a good player on the server
23:34 < rand> or could it be mitigate thx to the high score ?â€¦
23:36 < rand> this is tricky
23:37 < rand> better find sby to code this, and secretly corrupt Chillerdragon to fake official CTF by a "balanced" mod
23:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lol
23:41 < Dune> you could theoretically use econ to quickly set_team spec and player and simulate a forced death of a player :p
23:44 < rand> is it possible to get player health from econ ?
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> there are pickups in logs but no damage events
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so you can only get the health if no damage was dealt
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> or maybe wasnt there once this super verbose pr?
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> even with velocity and stuff
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I believe econ mods are just going to get banned once someone exploits them too much
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there's not much difference between modding the source and doing some econ hacking from the player's perspective
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (from whose perspective would it differ?)
23:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well imo current econ possibilitys are very limited so the worst abuse that i can imagine would be a chat based gambling machine or similar
23:58 < Dune> yeah you can abuse econ to tweak the gameplay
