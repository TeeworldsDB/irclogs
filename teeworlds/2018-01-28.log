02:06 < eeeee> heinrich5991: yeah but my point is that right now we don't have a way to establish such a connection in tw, and the easiest way to get that might be dtls
02:06 < eeeee> and if you dtls, you might as well also use public crypto for auth
13:42 < pinkieval> any idea why my 17-clients server does not appear in the server list, despite showing this in the logs?
13:42 < pinkieval> Jan 28 13:37:28 teeworlds2 off-infc-test[8312]: [5a6dc408][register]: chose 'master4.teeworlds.com' as master, sending heartbeats
13:42 < pinkieval> Jan 28 13:37:32 teeworlds2 off-infc-test[8312]: [5a6dc40c][register]: no firewall/nat problems detected

13:42 < pinkieval> Jan 28 13:37:32 teeworlds2 off-infc-test[8312]: [5a6dc40c][register]: server registered
13:43 < pinkieval> note: it's compiled with "bam server_debug"
13:45 < pinkieval> btw, I have a test server with lots of dummies, please don't ban it from the server list
13:45 < Learath2> what's it's name?
13:46 < pinkieval> "Official InfClass Server test | DE"
13:46 < pinkieval> it's hosted at 54.37.75.229:8400
13:49 < pinkieval> hmm, the server does not appear in favorites either
14:04 < Fels1> oink
14:13 < pinkieval> got it
14:14 < pinkieval> the issue was that I messed up the merge
14:14 < pinkieval> so the server name was sent twice
14:14 < pinkieval> obviously, that didn't play well with the packet's format
14:14 < pinkieval> I kind of guess that when I saw the server name replaced the game type :D
14:34 < pinkieval> yay, it works now
14:34 < pinkieval> I stopped the test server
14:35 < Learath2> \o/
17:38 < pinkieval> what if servers listened on (almost) all ports of the machine, and only allowed connection from an IP address to connect to the port sha1sum(secret_salt + ip_address)%64536 + 1024?
17:38 < pinkieval> it could work seemlessly for clients if master servers knew the secret_salt
17:38 < pinkieval> and would prevent udp spoofing
17:39 < pinkieval> well, most of it
17:42 < Learath2> if the client needs to know the secret_salt, it's not secret
17:53 < pinkieval> not the client
17:53 < pinkieval> the master server
