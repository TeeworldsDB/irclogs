09:48 < tyurd> does anyone have contact to unsigned char*?
09:58 < EastByte> tyurd: yes, I have
09:59 < tyurd> EastByte: could you write him? I heard he isn't that bad in ExtJS and I would need some help
10:00 < EastByte> I just did
10:00 < tyurd> thank you
10:02 < EastByte> he is afk right now
10:06 < tyurd> uhm, ok. can I contact him private?
10:07 < EastByte> I can leave him some messenger id if you want
10:10 < tyurd> uhm, skype would be perfect
10:11 < EastByte> you can send me your skype id via query then
10:11 < tyurd> sure
10:11 < tyurd> thank you 
10:12 < tyurd> wrote to you on skype
19:05 < guenstig_werben> @forum moderators (excluding heinrich5991) wanna make my thread)
19:05 < guenstig_werben> wanna make my thread (and heinrichs) sticky?
19:06 < guenstig_werben> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11667
19:40 <@minus> i don't think that's useful for the average user
19:42 < needs> Hey, I've just put online my ELO ranking system for teeworlds, you can check it here http://teerank.com/
19:43 < needs> I'm uploading the source code to github for those who are interrested
19:44 < needs> I'm running it since 4 hours and so far it doesn't do anything crazy ;)
19:45 < EastByte> where do the ranks come from?
19:45 < rand> ooh, do you use "spam" server info to make this ranking ?
19:45 < needs> I pull every 3 minutes every CTF servers and then compute a new ELO rank for each player online
19:46 < EastByte> ah
19:46 < EastByte> and why are there no clannames?
19:46 < needs> I just finished it, it is far from complete ^^
19:47 < needs> I managed to have something working to have a strong base for futur developments
19:47 <@matricks> prepare for hackers :D
19:47 < rand> hm, it may be relevant on dm, but in teamplay, you can't tell in which team are players, am I right ?
19:48 < needs> rand: yes, so it is not very accurate
19:48  * rand starts playing using another another name :3
19:48 < needs> ^^
19:48  * fstd starts forging serverinfo replies to make his score incredibly amazing
19:48 < EastByte> I wanted to do that
19:48 < rand> fstd: :D
19:48 < fstd> (and ruin rand's)
19:49 < rand> Noooo
19:49 < fstd> :P
19:49 < needs> matricks: I don't care, it's running on a dummy server, but if you find something, I'll be happy to fix it ;)
19:49 <@matricks> heh, I've been thinking about ranking systems for teeworlds, but found no solution for it
19:49 <@matricks> (global)
19:49 < needs> Let me upload the source code
19:49 < EastByte> needs: he was probably talking about faking the serverinfo
19:50 < rand> matricks: it seems it needs some account system
19:50 <@matricks> rand: more then that
19:50 < EastByte> we need determinism!
19:50 <@matricks> rand: identification system solves spoofing of players
19:50 < rand> (assuming nothing goes wrong with accounts) :3
19:50 <@matricks> rand: then you have the whole server side
19:51 < rand> i see
19:52 <@matricks> which I don't have a solution for
19:52 <@matricks> except only allowing ranking on approved servers taht you setup yourself
19:53 < guenstig_werben> it's like these statistics if you Google "teeworlds stats". they are funny, but not interesting
19:54 <@matricks> yah
19:54 <@matricks> if you introduce rankings, that gives people a reason to cheat
19:55 < guenstig_werben> that's also the reason why I like teeworlds (and don't like ddnet)
19:56 < guenstig_werben> you have just the score you have, everyone start with exactly the same opportunities except his skills
19:57 <@matricks> one of the design goals for teeworlds
19:57 <@matricks> everybody enters the fight equal
19:57 <@matricks> no random, and minimalistic
19:58 < guenstig_werben> I think that's what ppl playing like and others can't understand
19:59 <@matricks> oh well
19:59  * matricks continues to work
19:59  * guenstig_werben feels sick...
20:00 < needs> Note that every players start with an elo ranking of 1500, so everyone enters the ranking system equal too ;)
20:01 < guenstig_werben> someone sent a source link to a shoutbox in a channel, I made a git repo from that. does anyone want to continue the mod? it's called speedfng and is somehow normal fng...
20:01 < guenstig_werben> https://github.com/Schwertspize/speedfng
20:12 < fstd> most of my 'scoring' happens through hooking people off the map :(  i guess the ELO ranking won't pick up that
20:12 < fstd> whoever made that should learn how to use git
20:12 < fstd> @guenstic
20:13 < fstd> *g, even
20:14 < EastByte> fstd: hooking people off the map, are you sure?
20:14 < fstd> guenstig_werben: fork the upstream repository instead of checking it all into a new one as a single commit
20:14 < guenstig_werben> I don't think it's a for.
20:14 < guenstig_werben> fork
20:14 < guenstig_werben> but yes people should learn how to use git...
20:14 < fstd> of course it is a fork
20:14 < fstd> (and i happen to be the upstream)
20:15 < EastByte> fstd: whoops, you were talking about your own scoring
20:15 < fstd> but you obscured the fact that it is a fork (while dropping all history) by checking it all in into a new repository
20:15 < needs> https://github.com/needs/teerank
20:15 < guenstig_werben> So.. would you do that? I'm rather busy...
20:15 < fstd> would i do what?
20:16 < guenstig_werben> checking the repo out, create a fork,...
20:17 < guenstig_werben> I just did a quick & dirty solution so it don't get lost
20:17 < fstd> that's literally a single click on the github website, and no, i cannot fork stuff on behalf of foreign accounts
20:17 < needs> fstd: It only poll CTF server for now
20:17 < fstd> you are "Schwertspize", right?
20:17 < guenstig_werben> yeah
20:18 < guenstig_werben> guenstig werben is my ign
20:19 < fstd> (you realize 'spitze' is spelt with 't', right?)
20:19 < guenstig_werben> that's the point :D
20:19 < guenstig_werben> -> woo-hoo someone got it :) <-
20:19 < fstd> okay. :) anyhow, click the 'fork' button here: https://github.com/fstd/teeworlds
20:20 < guenstig_werben> and then?
20:20 < fstd> that way you will have all the history, and the ability to pull in openfng updates/fixes with ease
20:20 < guenstig_werben> I don't wanna do anything
20:20 < guenstig_werben> I know how to use git
20:20 < guenstig_werben> and github
20:20 < fstd> oh well.  whatever.
20:20 < EastByte> needs: you rarely see such projects purely written in C, not bad :p
20:21 < needs> haha :D
20:21 < needs> Just realized I did push the .o files
20:21 < guenstig_werben> I just published that repo for the user, he did not react on my post, but I just wanted to ask someone if they want to continue it
20:21 < guenstig_werben> if so, I would transfer ownership
20:22 < guenstig_werben> it's the same with TBlock
20:22 < guenstig_werben> https://github.com/Schwertspize/TBlock
20:22 < Obani> I hate ranks
20:22 < EastByte> ^ a fork still would have been the right solution, it's even quicker and less dirty
20:22 < fstd> plus a fork is maintainable, while a single check in is unlikely to be
20:22 < fstd> at least with respect to upstream updates
20:22 < guenstig_werben> OK I'll tey
20:24 < guenstig_werben> how can I have 2 forks of the same repo?
20:25 < Obani> I hate ranks cause it makes farmer have a high score
20:25 < fstd> you can't, that'd be pointless
20:25 < fstd> you can branch the fork that you have
20:25 < Obani> And if it's about ratio, it doesn't let you fight good players or make errors
20:26 < Obani> And it adds a stress feeling when you play
20:27 < needs> Obani: You can just ignore it then ;)
20:27 < Obani> No, cause others won't
20:27 < Obani> And it will be all about "my rank, my rank, my rank"
20:27 < needs> Obani: And you have an excuse for this one: it is not accurate at all because it doesn't have a lot of informations to compute ranks :P
20:27 < Obani> It's just like LoL players
20:28 < Obani> They don't even talk about their level
20:28 < Obani> They talk about their rank
20:28 < Obani> But still needs...
20:28 < Obani> There is a winner
20:28 < Obani> And some losers
20:29 < needs> Obani: You have winner and losers in teeworlds CTF and DM too
20:29 < guenstig_werben> MiB are megabytes or megabits
20:29 < Obani> needs, stop arguing like this
20:29 < Obani> I hate ranks cause they are permanent
20:30 < Obani> In teeworlds, you only are winner or loser for a game
20:30 < Obani> ranks needs you to be winner to all games
20:30 < needs> Obani: As you want
20:31 <@heinrich5991> Obani: what about ignoring the people who are so obsessed with their ranks? :)
20:31 <@minus> fstd │ you can't, that'd be pointless ← you can, it's not pointless
20:32 < Obani> heinrich5991, so they should take a paper and type when they win and when they lose
20:32 <@minus> when forking on github it offers you to choose a name if the repo already exists i guess
20:32 <@heinrich5991> Obani: but these people want to compare, why not let them? :)
20:32 < Obani> No they don't
20:32 < Obani> They want cause we give them possibility
20:33 <@minus> nvm you can't fork twice on github
20:33 < Obani> Do you know why LoL community suck so much ?
20:33 <@minus> but you can using teh classical way
20:33 < Obani> Cause they only talk about their ranks
20:33 < fstd> because it would be pointless.
20:33 < Obani> Ranks are owned with victories
20:33 <@minus> kind of
20:33 < fstd> minus: or what use-case would you see?
20:33 <@minus> if you want 2 clearly separate projects on github
20:33 <@minus> wrt issues and so
20:33 <@heinrich5991> fstd: at some point you were able to have two forks of the same repository
20:33 < Obani> If teeworlds gets like that, I'll probably begin to quit this game... And I've been playing it for 2 years !
20:34 < Obani> Actually it's the only game I play
20:34 <@heinrich5991> apart from lol? :P
20:34 < fstd> okay for github-specifics it might make sense, right
20:34 < Obani> Every game that has a permanent rank system has a shitty community
20:34 < Obani> Call of Duty
20:34 < Obani> Counter Strike
20:34 < needs> It's not like teeworlds is full a immature botters
20:34 < needs> *of
20:35 <@heinrich5991> Obani: I'm not sure you can make that relationship
20:35 <@heinrich5991> community of cs:s wasn't perfect either
20:35 < Obani> I can
20:35 <@heinrich5991> k
20:35 < Obani> I play Minetest
20:35 < Obani> And there is a game mode called Hunger Games
20:35 < Obani> A rank system was added to a server
20:36 < Obani> And then all nooby farmers went to it and got first ranks
20:36 < Obani> But because they were farming noobies
20:36 < Obani> And then they get proud, and annoy others
20:37 <@heinrich5991> aha
20:37 < Obani> WHen a game works with games
20:37 < Obani> The rank onl works for one game
20:37 < Obani> Getting stats is one thing
20:37 < Obani> But the rank is the worst thing to me
20:38 < Obani> Who gets the best player ? The one who is first rank or the one who beats everyone ?
20:38 <@heinrich5991> perhaps you should get less obsessed with the rank :)
20:38 < Obani> I'm not
20:38 <@heinrich5991> it seems you care about other people boasting with their rank ^^
20:38 < Obani> When there is a rank and someone starts to annoy me with it
20:38 < Obani> I stop playing
20:38 < Obani> Simple, effective
20:39 <@heinrich5991> for stopping to play, surely
20:40 <@heinrich5991> people also get mad about "kill steals" in teeworlds
20:40 <@heinrich5991> is that also annoying?
20:40 < Obani> In a tournament, ok
20:40 < Obani> heinrich5991, only in openfng
20:40 <@matricks> openfng... I always read openfag for some reason
20:41 < fstd> i think i have a pretty good idea what that reason might be ;P
20:42 < EastByte> it's about instagib and dragging
20:43 < EastByte> and all your base belongs to fstd 
20:44 < fstd> :P

20:56 <@matricks> Obani: was is it for?
20:56 < Obani> space-settlers, an early game made using godot engine
20:56 <@matricks> :)
20:57 < Obani> It is really early, so there isn't even any game xD
20:57 < Obani> I made all the instrumental part (final part) this afternoon/night
21:03 < Obani> matricks, listened to it ?
21:05 <@matricks> Obani: yes
21:05 < Obani> :)
