12:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @heinrich5991 i think i need you to review my PR
13:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oy, how do I buffer the messages?
13:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> don't send them all at once, send a few in the first tick, then the same number in the next tick, etc.
13:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> [9:06 PM] BOT[quakenet] Oy: similar to map/rcon list in the server engine
18:05 <@Dune> o/
18:06 <@Dune> for reference, @Sonix 's skins: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11530
18:07 <@Dune> @Zatline 's skins: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=7820
18:07 <@Dune> both are pretty good quality. I think some of them might be slightly too much/too big for vanilla / disturbing for the aim
18:12 <@Dune> porting the old scrollbar to the new system. deleting large chunks of code is very satisfying :D
18:24 < Oy> :D
18:25 < Oy> yeah, lots of great skins
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oy, am I doing something wrong or is this the way it works; I cant seem to set a skin to a player serverside if I dont send it every tick.
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I already disabled the Cl_Skinchange message and it still overwrites it with the normal skin
18:38 < Oy> should be sth wrong there, sending it once should be enough
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Well, is m_Teeinfos maybe used somewhere?
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Because I dont overwrite it, to keep default ykin
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> skin*
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Okay, it works now, but other players dont get the update
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> fixed
18:56 < Oy> Dune: think there was a mixup. i was referring to this line https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2195/files#diff-da8e51385055fcc863833513a3930b15R221 with my comment :)
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I wonder if you could add a beard with eyes
23:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I’ve ported some of my skins to the 0.7 system, I’ll post them once I’m back home in some weeks
