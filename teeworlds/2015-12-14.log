10:01 < tyurd> where I can find the newest 0.7 source ?
10:03 < allu2> Github?
10:03 < tyurd> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
10:03 < tyurd> thats 0.6.2
10:03 < allu2> Check branches?
10:03 < tyurd> branch master. branch 0.6 isn't 0.7, i guess.
10:04  * allu2 is on phone and won't bother checking
10:04 < allu2> But is out there
10:04 <@minus> master is 0.7
10:04 < allu2> Compiled it my self some weeks ago
10:05 < tyurd> minus: hmm, do I have access to it? I've compiled the lastest version from github and got version 0.6.2
10:05 < allu2> And 0.6 is 0.6.4, right?
10:06 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/version.h
10:06 <@heinrich5991> mh
10:06 <@heinrich5991> looks 0.7 although GAME_RELEASE_VERSION hasn't been updated
10:07 < tyurd> does 0.7 got the UI of 0.6? not the new one?
10:07 <@heinrich5991> 0.7 has a new UI
10:07 < tyurd> Ok. then I github:master isn't the newest version, for me :O
10:07 < tyurd> is*
10:09 <@heinrich5991> tyurd: what do you execute? do you execute ./teeworlds_d or do you execute build/x86_64/debug/teeworlds?
10:09 < tyurd> uhm, i think the wrong one
10:09 < tyurd> didn't knew that its on the other path
10:10 <@heinrich5991> I just remembered it from the output of bam: [630/630] #1 link build/x86_64/debug/teeworlds
10:10 < tyurd> my fault :x
10:10 < tyurd> (btw I can't run this version due graphics error. but I thats maybe becuz of my VM. i'll try it again when im home)
10:14 < tyurd> but thank you :)^
19:39 < RioDoro> Hey. Maybe you can help me. Someone is spamming the server list with 70 servers. Very annoying. I think this is advertising for his website. Url in every servername. IP: 89.163.249.46
19:44 <@heinrich5991> mh
19:51 <@minus> teeunity.eu → not working, www.forum.teeunity.eu → domain works, maintenance. nice.
19:51 < Mr-Anderson> :D
19:51 <@minus> b&
19:52 <@minus> i mean, DDNet shows up with 218 servers
19:52 <@minus> but those have almost 400 players
19:52 < deen> minus: over 500 right now, but ok
19:53 <@minus> my client might not have found all, was 393 when i just looked
19:53 < deen> oh right, with vanilla client
21:31 < RioDoro> @minus I'm sorry but the 70 servers are still there.
21:32 <@minus> odd
21:37 < MertenNor> em.. bam is in apt-get right?
21:37 < Henningstone> exactly
21:38 < MertenNor> so I should be able to just use it while in the game dir..
21:38 < MertenNor> bam server-release
21:38 < Henningstone> just try to and you'll see ;) for me at least, it works like that.
21:39 < MertenNor> oh.. I remember now.. xD lol
21:39 < MertenNor> no C compiler found.. lol
21:39 < Henningstone> xD you don't have gcc?
21:40 < MertenNor> I have
21:40 < MertenNor> Henningstone:^
21:41 <@minus> RioDoro: shit was fucked, fixed, should disappear any minute now
21:41 < Henningstone> MertenNor: then, what happens when you just type gcc into terminal?
21:42 < MertenNor> "gcc: fatal error: no input files compilation terminated."
21:42 < MertenNor> -.-
21:42 < Henningstone> hm, so you have. maybe a "bam config" helps?
21:42 < RioDoro> Thank you @minus
21:43 < MertenNor> Henningstone: need c compiler
21:44 < Henningstone> lol
21:44 < MertenNor> well I guess I need to get gcc working then right?
21:44 < MertenNor> or maybe not.. XD
21:45 < Henningstone> it seems to work if you can use it, that is quite weird
21:46 < MertenNor> yeah.. 
21:46 <@heinrich5991> try "echo 'main(){printf("works\n"); }' | gcc -x c -; ./a.out
21:46 <@heinrich5991> without the leading "
21:47 < MertenNor> <stdin>: In function âmainâ: <stdin>:1:8: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function âprintfâ [enabled by default] works
21:47 < Henningstone> so it works indeed
21:47 <@heinrich5991> try bam -c config
21:48 < MertenNor> configuration: configure.lua:368: no c/c++ compiler found bam: script error (-t for more detail)
21:48 <@heinrich5991> mh
21:48 < Henningstone> acquire a new bam.lua? (or try -t to see whats wrong first)
21:57 < Henningstone> lol what happened
21:57 <@heinrich5991> netsplit
21:57 <@heinrich5991> irc is a network of servers, this is what happens if there's an internal disconnect
21:58 < Henningstone> yeah
21:58 < Henningstone> never seen this in real ^^
22:09 < MertenNor> anyone have any idea why bam is not able to find gcc ?
22:09 < Henningstone> pls run bam -t and tell the problem :)
22:09 < MertenNor> http://pastebin.com/tm8vcsUg
22:11 < Henningstone> well, it doesn't seem to be a broken bam.lua, somehow it really doesn't find your compiler :/
22:12 < MertenNor> guess I could always just do it manualy..
22:12 < MertenNor> or ? na that wont work xD
22:13 <@heinrich5991> yes, that would work too, but it's a tedious task
22:15 < MertenNor> eh.. I have it compiled for linux on another server I guess can just use that.. 
22:17 < MertenNor> well I am out.. heinrich5991 Thanks for the help yet again! :)
22:18 < MertenNor> oh remember that oculus thing I sed I was going to ake ?
22:18 < MertenNor> make*
22:20 < MertenNor> eh nevermind.. cya guys later
22:20 <@heinrich5991> see ya
22:20 < Henningstone> bb
22:21 < Henningstone> oh he's already gone
22:30 < Henningstone> gtg, bye :)
