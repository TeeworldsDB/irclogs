10:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> big text is such a bad resolution :c is this a problem of the font? Or something we can improve somehow?
10:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> We don't have vector gfx
10:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea ik but enough pixels to display a font properly would be nice
10:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what is the limiting factor here?
10:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I guess you can always store higher font resolutions?
10:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Maybe we should ship a higher one that fits the max size we use
11:07 < Oy> huh, what font?
11:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> The image i posted showed that for example on game end the text "Team" is a noticable bad resolution.
11:28 < Oy> ok, could you open an issue about that?
11:29 < Oy> it's not a problem with the font cause the font we use is independent of resolutions
11:29 < Oy> it depends on how we render it
11:29 < Oy> it's probably caused by some scaling
12:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea thats why i am asking i dont even know what the bottleneck is
12:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Oh, didn't know :)
12:58 < Oy> if someone wants to fiddle around with it: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/components/scoreboard.cpp#L712
12:58 < Oy> try some higher resolution on these 2 lines
12:58 < Oy> but following offsets, sizes have to be adjusted too :(
13:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> If i can boot my slowpc :P
13:14 < Oy> oh, you still have that? :D
13:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> slow pc in 2k19
13:15 < Oy> probably don't have a 4k screen attached to it right?
13:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> even raspi can handle 4k nowadays lol
13:21 < Oy> but not teeworlds :P
13:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no, ofc not. Teeworlds is worse than crysis.
13:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh just to makre sure. Is the 0.7 protocol more secure?
13:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> And also aimed to protect agianst master attacks?
13:36 < Oy> u mean spoofing? yeah
13:37 < Oy> or dos against the masters? no, though clients store the server list locally now and use them in case the masters are not reachable - small improvement
13:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah k
13:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im working on 0.7 propÃ¼aganda try to not make too many fake new
13:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> s
13:43 < Dune> Oy: I do have a 4k screen attached to that yeah
13:44 < Oy> Dune: oh cool :D
13:44 < Dune> 800Mhz CPU tho
13:45 < Oy> ChillerDragon oh propaganda, best would be to learn from comical ali :D
13:45 < Oy> 800 ain't much
13:46 < Oy> but as long as the graphic card is decent it should work and you get enough frames :D
13:55 < Dune> The graphic card is good yes :D
13:55 < Dune> Text input lags on most apps but not on Teeworlds because GPU handles it :D
13:58 < Oy> yeah, teeworlds runs pretty good :D
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> any1 also having trouble with the menu maps since update?
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> [2019-09-29 15:27:40][datafile]: loading. filename='ui/themes/menu_day.map'

15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe the new hash check?
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> or is it me?
15:29 < Dune> haven't heard of this issue
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> try buildin form latest master
15:30 < Dune> are you on master? have you checked 0.7.3?
15:30 < Dune> brb 2min :D
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> master
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ™‚
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 2min build time rip
15:30 < Dune> yeah just checkout 0.7.3 and see if that happens I guess
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well it worked before git pull ... so
15:33 < Oy> works for me
15:34 < Oy> have heavens_day
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hue? :/
15:37 < Oy> could you check where you have these menu maps?
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah nvm i broke my system
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> checked out 0.7.3.1 and also didnt work
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> in data/ui where they should be
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> next to the executable in build dir (using cmake)
15:38 < Oy> yeah, but the ones you mentioned use the old naming sheme, they have different names
15:38 < Dune> oh right, didn't notice
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh
15:59 < Oy> maybe you cleaned the working directory before you pulled and so the old files got removed
16:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i did a reclone
16:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> didnt help ill look into it later
17:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well i fixed it by updating my settings maybe some custom client messed that up
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> [2019-09-29 17:53:51][game]: kill killer='-2:1:' victim='0:0:ChillerDragon' weapon=3 special=0
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> will it stay like this? with the empty name for the killer
18:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Oo is it empty every time or empty because the nickname is empty :O?
