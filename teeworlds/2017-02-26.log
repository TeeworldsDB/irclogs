19:14 < necropotame> If you would reimplement everything in TeeWorlds, will you keep the all-UDP protocol? Or some parts should use TCP?
19:18 <@matricks> no, everything UDP
19:19 <@minus> UDP stands for United Data Packets. If you're not nice to them they'll attack you in masses.
19:23 < Edible> what gave way to that question?
19:23 < necropotame> I've saw that UDP is much harder to mitigate
19:23 < necropotame> Edible, it's for TeeUniverse
19:23 < Edible> whats that?
19:26 < Edible> ah, i see
19:31 < necropotame> ATM, it's a map editor. I'm looking for adding collaborative edition. In the future, it will be a game + server with compatibility with TW/DDNet
19:36 <@matricks> necropotame: TCP for action based games are horrible
19:37 <@matricks> necropotame: and handling two connections is also a nightmare
19:39 < necropotame> @matricks, as far as I know, TCP should not be better too for map download
19:54 < EastByte> necropotame: you can always implement a better TCP on top of UDP but the packets will have a lower priority in many networks
19:55 < EastByte> for file transfer it's reasonable to use a protocol that's well supported everywhere (like HTTP)
20:02 <@matricks> EastByte: my ressys branch could do a lot of that stuff :)
20:02 <@matricks> EastByte: it had support for resources from disk, game server or a http server
20:03 <@matricks> EastByte: and you could load the home game (except the exe) from a http server :)
20:04 < EastByte> neat
20:06 < necropotame> So everything with UDP + token and something to prevent lost packets, and download of big files via http
20:08 < EastByte> yea, I would recommend that
20:13 < necropotame> Thanks :)
