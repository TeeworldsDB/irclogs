00:44 < nameless_tee22> hey guys, anyone not afk?
00:45 < rayv> yeah
00:45 < nameless_tee22> i've a question
00:45 < nameless_tee22> my pc cant resolve any of the teeworlds master servers
00:46 < nameless_tee22> and i dont know how to fix that, any ideas?
00:47 < rayv> nameless_tee22: I would suggest looking at firewall, but probably that's not the case. Try asking matricks or minus 
00:52 < pielover88888> hello all o.o
00:52 < rayv> yo
00:54 < nameless_tee22> sure, if i get the chance to meet them here
00:54 < pielover88888> hold on let me join here with my regular client xD
00:56 < pielover88888> here we go
04:15 < pielover88888> hi Edible 
04:20 < Edible> hey pie
04:20 < pielover88888> You're never on wetfish irc anymore :c
04:20 < Edible> yeah :(
04:20 < pielover88888> why not? :(
04:22 < Edible> good question
04:22 < pielover88888> you weren't banned, right? o.O
04:22 < Edible> nope
04:23 < Edible> lets see... i dont really remember. i just told myself i wouldnt join anymore. and so i stopped. and i havent anymore.
04:24 < pielover88888> :(
04:25 < Edible> if you want i can join again. but i dont feel like conversing today.
04:26 < pielover88888> eh, irc is for idling. might as well idle on multiple servers at the same time, right? :)
04:26 < Edible> no
04:27 < pielover88888> ok xD
04:29 < pielover88888> well, I've been making a mod lately. A few people have said that they liked it, a few have said that they loved it. And one said that they absolutely hated it. xD
04:29 < Edible> i am on 6 servers, around 20 channels overall, and i participate in all of them, whether its reading or having actual conversations, if i cannot do that, i simply do not join.
04:30 < pielover88888> yeah..wetfish isn't very conversation friendly..
04:31 < Edible> it is. at least rachel is. you too. and some others. but well, fine. I"ll start joining again.
04:32 < pielover88888> ok :)
04:32 < Edible> what mod did you make?
04:33 < pielover88888> Domination. Currently, it only supports one domination spot..but other than that, fully functions. Has an instagib variation as well.
04:33 < Edible> a la ut?
04:33 < pielover88888> yep
04:33 < pielover88888> Wanted to keep the modes separate--imagine iCTF goers voting for instagib mode while all the vanilla players have it how they want it? chaos xD
04:35 < Edible> if there is anything i can do let me know :)
04:35 < Edible> that sounds very cool btw :)
04:35 < pielover88888> considering I don't even know how to declare a variable in C++..you could probably do a lot!
04:35 < pielover88888> thanks :)
04:37 < Edible> i dont know how to do that either
04:37 < pielover88888> xD
04:37 < pielover88888> the mod on my github, but very messily written. http://github.com/pielover88888/teeworlds-DTF
04:37 < Edible> does C++ have support for multi type variables? (or however you call them)
04:38 < pielover88888> like, declare a variable as an integer, then concat it onto a string and it just ..does?
04:38 < pielover88888> not that I know of xD
04:38 < Edible> int x would declare a variable type int, but not a variable. thats all i remember out of C
04:40 < Edible> what does DTF stand for?
04:40 < pielover88888> Basically, I just need to be able to have more than one flag per team in the gameworld. near here: https://github.com/pielover88888/teeworlds-DTF/blob/master/src/game/server/gamemodes/ctf.cpp#L26
04:40 < pielover88888> Dominate the flags
04:41 < Edible> oh
04:41 < Edible> so you actually pick them up?
04:41 < pielover88888> nah, you can't walk around with them. That's what the F->Reset(); being spammed in the pick-up-flags function prevents.
04:42 < pielover88888> Line 306 in ctf.cpp for example
04:47 < Edible> welp, i cant understand anything.
04:50 < Edible> / return the flag   272. i dont think you need that code right?
04:51 < pielover88888> technically not
04:52 < Edible> i dont remember much about UT, but the way domination worked was you stepped on the spot, and if any team landed on it it was now theirs, and the counter began going up
04:54 < pielover88888> basically it works like that, but if two teams are on it at the same time, they just both score.
04:55 < Edible> should it work that way?
04:55 < pielover88888> probably not, but it didn't seem to effect gameplay.
04:57 < pielover88888> I wanted some indication that players were scoring--people seemed quite confused..
04:58 < pielover88888> And I just figured it out: hovering flags.
04:58 < pielover88888> F->m_Vel.y += GameServer()->m_World.m_Core.m_Tuning.m_Gravity; if I invert this and call it when picking up the flag then it should work.
05:01 < Edible> mmm, that seems more complicated
05:01 < pielover88888> yeah, but then at least people wouldn't need me to explain that they have to sit on the center to get points. xD
05:02 < pielover88888> plus, it would indicate which flag is being scored on..
05:03 < Edible> what about the scoreboard on the right?
05:03 < pielover88888> what about it?
05:03 < Edible> if it shows a tee there, then that shows who's scoring currently
05:04 < pielover88888> well, currently it doesn't. No idea how to fix that.
05:05 < pielover88888> brb
05:09 < pielover88888> back
05:10 < Edible> oh thats funny
05:11 < pielover88888> what?
05:12 < Edible> there is a loop that runs twice, i just use a function and call it twice instead of creating a loop... mmm i wonder if thats good practice...
05:13 < pielover88888> if invalid inputs in the loop can cause it to repeat, then avoiding the loop would be good
05:15 < Edible> yeah, the loop is better then.
05:15 < Edible> darnit, if only i could compile this
05:15 < Edible> friggin windows
05:17 < pielover88888> I know, right? xD
05:21 < Edible> ok, how about this, you have only 1 flag. the player sets it up somewhere, its a large map, and players of both teams need to just step on the flag for a counter to begin to start scoring. so that means a huge simplification of code. there is no carrying, no on dying event. and so on...?
05:22 < pielover88888> considering it's just ctf with the inability to pick up the flags.. I could make it not check which team picks up which flag.
05:22 < pielover88888> then you can place both flags, to have two domination points. maybe.
05:27 < Edible> actually scratch that my idea was too complicated
05:27 < pielover88888> yeah, your idea would've been erasing most of the original ctf code..
05:28 < pielover88888> and I need that to learn from xD
05:30 < Edible> naa
05:30 < Edible> you can still have it in another tab
05:30 < pielover88888> worth noting my editor is Nano being used on my server over SSH
05:30 < Edible> oh gawd
05:31 < Edible> blegh
05:31  * Edible begins throwing up
05:31 < pielover88888> blame windows, if compiling teeworlds worked on it, I wouldn't do such crazy shit. But, alas, I can only compile on my server.
05:31 < pielover88888> which luckily has linux <3
05:38 < Edible> what if you set up ftp on windows, then used fuse to mount it (you can do that i think?) and just maked away when apropriate
05:41 < pielover88888> I could, but so often I make such major changes when I originally thought I was just tweaking something, and I need to be able to do Ctrl+o, enter, ctrl+x,bam -s bam.lua, and run the new binary :3
05:43 < Edible> cant you cross compile?
05:43 < pielover88888> what do you mean? o.o I can't compile worth a damn on windows..
05:44 < Edible> thats exactly my point, you edit here, and over there you just cross compile. and the binary will appear here. dont know how to cross compile though
05:45 < pielover88888> you mean just sending the modified source from my Windows computer to my Linux server then compiling?
05:45 < pielover88888> oh nevermind, you meant compiling for windows on linux.. derp xD
05:47 < Edible> yeah! fuse man!
05:47 < Edible> you should look into nfs and 9p
05:48 < pielover88888> will do :)
05:48 < Edible> and yeah, thats what i mean! but you dont actually have to send anything, because its already mounted, like a filesystem
05:48 < Edible> so all you do is the compile commands
05:48 < pielover88888> ah, I see
05:49 < pielover88888> recently I had this idea for a client mod
05:50 < Edible> a what?
05:50 < Edible> for teeworlds?
05:50 < pielover88888> yes
05:50 < Edible> what idea?
05:50 < pielover88888> well, you know how dm7 or dm2 have shadows in the underground part? basically, a mod which adds shadow tiles under platforms.
05:51 < Edible> i have no idea, never played dm
05:51 < Edible> well i do, but not much
05:51 < pielover88888> I'll get a screenshot
05:51 < Edible> wow, i already took out 50+ lines
05:51 < Edible> this will be completely useless
05:52 < pielover88888> this is technically not dm7, just a dm7 rework, but sme idea: http://s3.hostingkartinok.com/uploads/images/2012/09/3976811508f90a16fe196f427c1e6855.jpg
05:52 < pielover88888> same*
05:52 < Edible> but isnt that just the tile changing opacity ?
05:52 < Edible> (never done a map, but i thought thats how they did it)
05:53 < pielover88888> it's in grass_main.png, they just added semi-opaque triangles.
05:55 < Edible> oh alright
05:55 < Edible> well idk, that seems too complicated for me.
05:55 < pielover88888> me too xD
05:55 < Edible> btw what is the snap function?
05:56 < pielover88888> I think it's for spectators "snapping" to tees
05:56 < Edible> no
05:56 < Edible> well mmm maybe
05:57 < Edible> why is there flag code in there then?
05:57 < pielover88888> not sure o.o
05:57 < pielover88888> and why is it not needed in dm at all
05:57 < pielover88888> probably not for spectators snapping xD
05:57 < Edible> damnit pielover88888 ! i was very chill watching anime and now i just keep stripping this ctf file
05:57 < pielover88888> xD sorry
05:59 < Edible> ok, so the only thing it could do is draw the player with the flag
05:59 < Edible> in the speccing
05:59 < Edible> like you said
06:04 < Edible> pielover88888, did you write if(m_aTeamscore[fi^1] == 200){ ?
06:04 < Edible> and all that subsequent code?
06:04 < pielover88888> yes, and I am ashamed of it!
06:04 < Edible> ah
06:04 < Edible> you can use a switch you know?
06:05 < pielover88888> Nope, don't know that
06:08 < Edible> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/66k51h7a.aspx
06:14 < Edible> so basically it would look like this pielover88888 http://dpaste.com/2TF1258
06:15 < pielover88888> ah, I see
06:18 < Edible> something like for i=1,10 do if (i*100){sound capture} }
06:18 < Edible> in really broken pseudocode
06:19 < Edible> which would save you 20 lines
06:20 < pielover88888> that'd be good xD
06:21 < Edible> why do you want to sound the capture thing?
06:23 < Edible> oh look,Oy already did it
06:23 < Edible> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3289
06:23 < pielover88888> just wanted some audible indication of "get your ass to the middle you noobs"
06:23 < pielover88888> oh..oy already did it?
06:23 < Edible> yeah but
06:23 < Edible> its 2009 mod
06:23 < Edible> so it wont work on the latest teeworlds version
06:24 < pielover88888> cant find the download link and everything seems a 404
06:24 < Edible> aw
06:24 < Edible> mm
06:24 < pielover88888> also King Of The Hill mod is domination it just..isn't fighty enough
06:25 < Edible> maybe he has a branch of it on git?
06:25 < pielover88888> maybe
06:26 < pielover88888> nope https://github.com/oy?tab=repositories
06:27 < Edible> welp, worth a try
06:27 < Edible> HOW CAN YOU NOT SAVE YOUR CODE
06:27 < Edible> that cant be
06:27 < pielover88888> I HAVE EXACT SAME FEELS BUT
06:28 < pielover88888> Edible: the creator of that forum post is not Oy
06:28 < pielover88888> and why is that mod under fan art and other lolwtf
06:28 < Edible> read somewhere that he helped with the coding
06:33 < pielover88888> welcome back fstd 
06:35 < pielover88888> I'm gonna try to make flags hover during scoring o.o
06:43 < pielover88888> "F->m_Vel.y += Gablahblah" is the original code. switching it to "F->m_Vel.y -= Gablahblah" would invert it, right?
07:27 < Edible> i have no idea 
07:28 < Edible> uhh... but vel means velocity right?
07:40 <@matricks> :)
07:41 < Edible> good morning matricks 
07:41 <@matricks> morning
07:42 < pielover88888> hi matricks !
07:42 < Edible> i think, that is actually the code that makes the flag appear as the player movies pielover88888 
07:43 < pielover88888> vel? or snapping?
07:43 < Edible> or maybe not.
07:43 < Edible> vel
07:43 < pielover88888> vel is velocity
07:43 < pielover88888> you can tell because it has to do with the gravity tune
07:44 < Edible> oh
07:48 <@matricks> :)
