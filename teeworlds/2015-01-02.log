00:00 < MertenNor> I am suprised that so many people still hang around in here :)
00:06 < JulianAssange> #1 idle chat
00:34 <@minus> you could say that in any of the other 50 channels i'm in
00:37 < Rajh> Hi
00:37 < Rajh> Still no plan for an account system with ranking and matchmaking ?
00:57 < Rajh> and LUA addons support too :)
01:56 < hl037> Hey !
01:57 < hl037> And happy new year ! :)
01:57 < hl037> I've some questions about the Demoplayer
01:57 < hl037> I would like to make a standalone demo reader to retrieve stat about recorded game then save it to a database.
01:58 < Speedy_Consoles> vmath.h only includes the c++ math.h
01:59 < hl037> but the public interface of the CDemoplayer doesn't provide any function to read all the snapshots
01:59 < Speedy_Consoles> not the teeworlds math.h
01:59 < Speedy_Consoles> vmath.h only works if you include math.h first
02:02 < heinrich5991> hl037: it looks like the demo interface is only made to control the demo player, not to use it
02:02 < heinrich5991> it looks like the actual demo events are passed through the gameclient interface
02:02 < hl037> Then I used a while on the next frame function but there is some chunk gives a "error during unpacking of delta, err=-2"
02:02 < hl037> [03:02] <heinrich5991> it looks like the actual demo events are passed through the gameclient interface
02:03 < hl037> <<< yes I know
02:03 < hl037> So I coded a custom CDemoPlayerIListner
02:03 < hl037> *CDemoPlayer::IListner
02:03 < hl037> inspired by the CClient class and CGameClient
02:04 < hl037> I also initialised huffman
02:04 < heinrich5991> huffman shouldn't be needed (I think?)
02:05 < hl037> It is because demo are simply all networks packets recorded to a file
02:06 < hl037> CNetBase::Init();
02:08 < Rajh> It has already be done, hasnt it ?
02:08 < Rajh> demo to video conversion
02:08 < heinrich5991> yea, I think so
02:12 < hl037> but it's not "demo to video" I want (but if the source could be interesting), It's just about record player carcteristic, kills, weapon, ping etc.
02:13 < hl037> *but the sources could be interesting
02:15 < hl037> arf... it's a graphical tool :/ so it just record the rendered image and it is not a standalone demo reader
02:16 < hl037> https://github.com/hl037/teeworlds/tree/hl037/src/tools/statsystem <-- this is my current code 
02:21 < hl037> in fact, my real question "could be" : "how a demo is read in the client?", what functions are called, just to read the demo (not to render) the demo and decode chunks ?
02:45 < JulianAssange> i'm mad
02:47 < Rajh> Yeah
02:49 < Rajh> Yo jordane
02:49 < jordane> Hi Rajh 
02:49 < Rajh> Wassup ?
23:37 < baklava-tee> .buffer up
23:37 < baklava-tee> Oops, nvm!
