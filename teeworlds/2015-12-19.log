18:34 <@matricks> minus: teeworlds.com renewed
18:34 <@heinrich5991> +1
18:35 <@minus> matricks: did it run out?
18:35 <@matricks> minus: runs out in january
18:36 <@matricks> 16 jan
18:38 <@matricks> better refresh that before I flee to colombia :)
18:40 <@matricks> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=23567#p23567
18:40 <@matricks> well
18:40 <@matricks> that was a while ago
18:59 <@minus> haha
19:00 <@minus> me right now tho
19:00 <@minus> i feel old
19:00 <@matricks> how old are you?
19:00 <@minus> well, 25
19:01 <@matricks> pfft, youngling
19:04 <@minus> did you do any advent of code, matricks?
19:05 <@matricks> no, havn't had time :/
19:05 <@matricks> the time before xmas is always kinda stressful
19:05 <@matricks> full schedule
21:04 <@minus> heinrich5991: stopped doing advent of code?
21:04 <@heinrich5991> so far I can say temporarily :)
21:04 <@heinrich5991> I just wrote my last exam today
21:04 <@minus> woot
21:04 <@minus> haven't had any exams yet for this semester
21:04 <@heinrich5991> yes, I'm abroad and the times are shifted here
21:05 <@heinrich5991> btw, did you see Oy?
21:05 <@heinrich5991> I wanted to talk to him regarding http master in 0.7
21:05 <@minus> nope
21:07 <@minus> day 15 is basically solving a overdefined linear equation system
21:08 <@heinrich5991> minimize squared error?
21:09 <@heinrich5991> should it minimize squared error?
21:09 <@minus> s/solving/maximizing
21:10 <@minus> maximizing a function of 4 inputs
21:10 <@heinrich5991> ah. a linear function?
21:10 <@minus> yeah
21:10 <@heinrich5991> there's an easy way to do that iirc
21:11 <@heinrich5991> I believe you wander around on the vertices of the polygon that you're constrained to
21:11 <@minus> it's not hard to brute force tho, 1M possibilities
21:11 <@heinrich5991> (if it's a polygon)
21:15 <@minus> actualy forget it,  it requires to do some multiplication of some shit afterwards. need to brute force after all
22:03 < Dunedune> thanks for the renewal
22:20 <@minus> urgh, that was tough
22:21 <@minus> unbelievable how hard it is to get a list of numbers that sum up to 100
22:21 <@minus> (if you don't do the trivial way of using 4 for loops to get 4 numbers)
22:30 < nheir> *3 for loops
22:30 < nheir> (for 4 numbers)
22:33 <@heinrich5991> heh
22:33 <@heinrich5991> good point
22:33 <@minus> yeah yeah
