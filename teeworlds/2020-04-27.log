02:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you need to basically set the individual bodyparts of a skin and send them to all players as Update
03:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/zcatch/blob/zCatch-0.7.x/src/game/server/gamemodes/zcatch.cpp ::OnPlayerInfoChange (line 1081) pPlayer->UpdateSkinColors() updates the internal state of the player. UpdateSkinsOf(..) sends the update to all of the players.
03:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Learath2 you mean the editor defaults?
03:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/zcatch/blob/zCatch-0.7.x/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp Line 1694 is where the custom commands are registered. you would need to add such a command for your skin changing. the functions must have the same signature like the ones already registered.
04:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack this looks interesting.
08:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Dune well yes, but not only that, I want to know how in general quads and layers are supposed to be sized
09:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Quads just size them enough to cover proof view just as default shows
10:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> It was a bad idea moving those gameplay issues to the forum they ended up forgotten (by me aswell)
12:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> They were getting out of hand on github
13:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> to me quads in tw are like what skyboxes are in 3d u need it to cover the void
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I wonder how the sizing works, like we can have things like the background which take up the entire background, but also small clouds that don't take the entire view
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Clouds dont have to cover whole display view
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> While background does have to in order to avoid having yellow background on the sides
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I agree, how do you size the background to be enough?
16:03 < Dune> you make it have parallax and be bigger than the tee view?
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Enable proof view in editor
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Theres a button called proof that shows you display views
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Red green and white outlined boxes
20:57 < ChillerDragon> what do you guys think about getting github.com/teeworlds verified?
20:58 < ChillerDragon> https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/verifying-your-organizations-domain
20:59 < ChillerDragon> minus, Kottizen ^
20:59 < minus> why
20:59 < ChillerDragon> looks cool 
20:59  * minus carries on
21:00 < ChillerDragon> :/
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Lol
21:25 < ChillerDragon> @Sonix you can't see /me over there right?
21:25  * ChillerDragon yo sonix?
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> no
21:28 < ChillerDragon> who even has access to the domain?
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> ?
22:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ChillerDragon, are you there?
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> If I use `IStorage::RemoveFile`, what is the pFilename? Is it the whole path, or path starting from the executable?
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it's a path similar to those that you pass to `OpenFile`
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> i.e. it starts at all the directories simulataneously
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ~/.teeworlds
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> binary directory
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> global directory
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so deleting a file in data/maps would work with the filename `data/maps/xyz.map`?
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> because that doesnt work
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> maps/xyz.map
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> also doesnt owkr
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oh wait a second
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea no
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> doesnt work
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> maybe because I try it from inside ListDirectory?
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> from the callback
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea, thats probably the issue...
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> is there a way to remove a file from inside ListDirectory? :D
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well nvm i think
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It's the directory you are listing concatenated with the filename, in the same storage type
