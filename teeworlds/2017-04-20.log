00:03 < Stitch626> i'd like to say my "thinking" about too :P I personally prefer using distributions like debian, i prefer oldstable things, things wich work perfectly and didnt change very often... but if i need a newer package which isnt available i build it from source. I've compiled hostapd and tvheadend from source because the versions were too old or needed to be patched (in case of hostapd)..
00:04 < Stitch626> i also like the fact you can install software via a package management system, but you're still free to compile it from source - if needed to. i think thats the normal behavior in most cases
00:05 < Stitch626> i also don't see there any disadvantages from my side, but its up to every user what he's preferring
00:05 < Stitch626> that was just my side ^^
17:09 < fstd> your left side or your right side?
21:02 < Stitch626> both :P
21:02 < Stitch626> would "position" be a better word for that?
