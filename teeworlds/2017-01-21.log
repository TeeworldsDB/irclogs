15:47 < necropotame> There is someone that remember the URL for bInfMod sources?
16:22 < Socialdarwinist> necropotame I have looked through my history of github.com and teeworlds.com visits and conclude that I have never seen them.
16:31 < necropotame> Found in the deepness of IRC logs https://bitbucket.org/gwilherm/infection/branch/bModInf 
18:30 < necropotame> I've created a github organization that should contains a copy of most of popular teeworlds mods. This is mainly for mods that are not super active. The main goals is to centralize things to not lost them and to port old mods to 0.6.4 in a branch "tw06", and maybe to harmonize them a little in a branch "harmony" (with UTF8 names, mute cmd and other basic stuff).
18:30 < necropotame> I'm open to any suggestion of mods :)
