00:12 <@Dune> your server kicks me even when I spec, rand. that's intended?
00:13 < rand> depend on the server configuration
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> uhm can someone tell me where i find all the sound constants
00:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> like SOUND_PLAYER_PAIN_LONG
00:14 <@Dune> those are generated by the .py file
00:14 <@Dune> rand: well you configured it ^^
00:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ya i thought that @Dune
00:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but hwo and which py file
00:14 < rand> by default, it should not
00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> or what is the hrt sound name?
00:15 < rand> oh
00:15 <@Dune> http://puu.sh/Cd3EA/232dccd1ac.png
00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sfx_pickup_hrt-02.wv
00:15 < rand> by default, it does
00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> srching this one
00:15 <@Dune> this says they are in darasrc/content.py
00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh men i was always just grepping the src dir me nobo
00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ty
00:15 <@Dune> ;)datasrc too
00:16 < rand> >  "How to deal with inactive clients (0=move player to spectator, 1=move player to spectator and kick spectator, 2=move to free spectator slot/kick, 3=kick)"
00:16 < rand> default is 2
00:16 <@Dune> huh
00:16 <@Dune> I didn't think option 2 meant move to free spectator and kick anyway
00:16 <@Dune> I thought if there is no spectator slot it would kick
00:16 <@Dune> that sounds a bit shitty :|
00:16 < rand> it's always kick anyway except 0
00:17 < rand> it kick the player 
00:17 <@Dune> what's the point of kicking when there are free spec slots
00:17 < rand> 2 is a more violent version of 1
00:18 < rand> what the point of kicking then, and you go to 0
00:19 < rand> well, i understand that this may not be the good compromise 
00:19 < rand> better do smth between 0 and 1 than 1 and 3
00:20 < rand> at least, it works as intended ^^'
00:20 < Teeworlds> [documentation] Dune-jr pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fp1N1
00:20 < Teeworlds> documentation/master 3be432e Jordy Ruiz: Notify that SDL and Freetype are no longer shipped
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh lol 2 different sound files with the same id xd
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> understanding tw code is so hard .-.
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but i got it c:
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ty @Dune
00:21 <@Dune> any foreign source code is like that imo
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> true i guess

12:23 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr opened pull request #1800: More localization context (master...add-locale-context) https://git.io/fpMVh
12:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon if you have time at some point, could you check if the SDL upgrade fixed the MacOS hack in src/engine/client/input.cpp:194 ?
12:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> e.g. remove the hack and check the mouse state at start
12:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune test what? a pr or master?
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> huh? just test it locally?
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah xd
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so what should i do seems like i missed soemthing
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> look at the hack at src/engine/client/input.cpp:194
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> try to remove it and see if it breaks something?
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> k
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ouch macbook went black hehe
12:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hope he is not dead agian
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> :| the macbook I have home does that too
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think @Captain_AMN 's mousewheel issue comes from this: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/4d0e80e22b1f9688f28f5ec7d989c191db9b08e2#diff-538d8e3d27c4e0509506a91d86286951
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Multiple mousewheel inputs are seemingly condensed into one, now
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> uff im live agian @Dune
12:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it happend me only one time with my old macbook and he never came back agian :c rip
12:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its funny it went black during compiling and now compiling is done no errors xd
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://www.macworld.com/article/2881177/macs/how-to-reset-your-macs-nvram-pram-and-smc.html
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Command-Option-P-R fixed it for me
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> good to know
12:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so remove the whole ifdef and its content?
12:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes
12:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> k
12:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what should i test for
12:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the client launched
12:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that the mouse doesn't act faulty on startup
12:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> on startup?
12:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> in the menu?
12:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well it moves
12:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> in fullscreen
12:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
12:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I dont know if the sense is messed up or something i dont use this macbook to play
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But ingame and in the menu the mouse works
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well, alright, thanks
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> should i pr it?
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> nooo
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> k
17:43 < MertenNor> why dont we have more of these: https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=server_tuning ?
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we do, MertenNor
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=server_commands
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> or did you mean tunings specifically
17:45 < MertenNor> tuning
17:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> those are old tunings to set the physics of the server
17:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> they were introduced long ago
17:47 < MertenNor> I know.. but would be nice to have more of them so people can make simple mods with them
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> either way that would be *very* limited mods
17:48 < MertenNor> hmm not really depends on how much you can tune
17:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you'd need a whole scripting language to make that work
17:50 < MertenNor> true true
18:00 < MertenNor> waiting for instagib :P haha
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> is it possible to add this to 0.7.1 https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1734
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i think that should be part of the scoreboard change
19:08 < rand> why not copying the whole scoreboard ?
19:09 < rand> ping/tee/name/clan/flag/K/D/score 
19:27 < MertenNor> did someone do something to the master servers? I can see my server now.. could only see it on local before 
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> rand, also ok
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> but it should get implemented in the release..
19:29 < MertenNor> oh.. would be fun to have target practice like in smash with timer and all haha 
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> the score in the middle of the scoreboard is not cool
20:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> score in the middle of scorebord is bad yes
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> also the countryflag should equal the size of the characters ... it's way too large right now ughh
