02:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @fokkonaut wanna test a fun tool :o?
02:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> wat tool?
02:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I did make a poc for banning players joining with the IP of a registered gameserver IP
02:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> interesting
02:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> basically proxy gameservers
02:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> rip home servers
02:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> open for feedback
02:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> sounds cool but i think fokko found another way (dont wanna discuss all details here) \:D
02:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> k
02:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/TeeworldsEconVPNDetectionGo
02:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> whoever needs or wants
02:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> ye ik
02:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> i suggested it to fokko but he didnt want it \:D
02:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> took quite long, cuz my old twapi did only fetch 75 ip addresses
02:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> had to rewrite most of the browser library stuff :'/
02:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 75 per master server*
02:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> is i onky by default?
02:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> is i on by default?
02:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the proxy stuff? yeah, it's enabled by default
02:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> i mean home servers are a thing so it might have false positives by default
02:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> added an issue, pls comment if you want
02:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> when my brain works properly again, I might add that D
02:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> how would you add it tho?
02:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> a toggle option
02:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> ah right
02:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, one can't distinguish home server ips from non home server.
02:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> i thought some way of reducing false positives
02:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> one might work with whitelists
02:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> you can only target servers that have duplicated or similar names
02:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> exlcude "unnamed server" etc
02:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> pls comment in the issue if you get some ideas. Fetching server infos is kinda highly inperformant ...
02:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> üò¶
02:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> hmm
02:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I mean my implementation,
02:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> are u supporting http masters?
02:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> guess there is a lot of room for impovement
02:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there is a http protocol?
02:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I mean, server infos do not come from masters anyway?
02:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> fetching of ip addresses is fine
02:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> with udp
02:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> heinrich made some http masters for ddnet/0.6 they should be easy to implement and also fast
02:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> every server can register there
02:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I don't touch 0.6
02:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but would be nice for 0.7 as well
02:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> you can implement it in 0.7 too ofc
02:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> question is, do 0.7 master do that already or not?
02:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> masters
02:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> http?
02:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> no
02:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> k
02:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> tired and confused üê¢
02:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json
02:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> also has server info
02:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's nice
03:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I can easily create json from the current protocol/api but fetching server infos is tedious imo, as you get lots of timeouts and fetching the whole  server list seems kinda impossible in one go :/.
03:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> yea i can imagine... thats why the http master is such a cool thing
09:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @jxsl13 As chillerdragon answered for me already, I have another way of VPN detection. If you are interested though, you can dm me
10:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> also fetching the server IPs from ddnet http master servers,  thi swhole feature is now off by default
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> Nice
16:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune vali fakes Server again
