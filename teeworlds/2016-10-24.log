16:23 <@minus> holy fucking fuck
16:23 <@minus> some chinese dude sent me an email this morning about not getting a registration email for the forum
16:23 <@minus> less than three minutes after registering
16:24 <@minus> checked the admin panel to resend his registration email only to see it worked and he had one post already
16:24 <@minus> now comes the biggest wtf: that post was spam
16:24 <@minus> like, wtf is wrong with people
16:44 < deen> shameless spammers, haha
16:50 <@minus> replied nicely to not spam again
16:51 <@minus> was debating about whether to send insults or not, but we're civilized people after all
