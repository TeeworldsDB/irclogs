18:33 < nameless_tee32> hello
18:38 < masoudd> nameless_tee32: Hey
18:42 <@matricks> nameless_tee32: talk here
18:43 < nameless_tee32> ah okay
18:43 < nameless_tee32> well i have one problem
18:44 < nameless_tee32> i want to setup domain  i did it allready
18:44 < nameless_tee32> and it work fine
18:44 < nameless_tee32> people can connect to server but
18:44 < nameless_tee32> i have antoher problem XD
18:44 < nameless_tee32> how cna i do to it show on server list instead of ip?
18:52 <@matricks> let it trough your firewall and enable sv_register 1
18:56 < nameless_tee32> one sec
18:58 < nameless_tee32> mmm
18:59 < nameless_tee32> how to i let it througt firewall?
19:01 <@matricks> depends on your firewall
19:01 <@matricks> http://portforward.com/
19:04 < nameless_tee32> well i mean
19:04 < nameless_tee32> listen
19:04 < nameless_tee32> i just have server but its  always udner ddos
19:04 < nameless_tee32> but it doesnt matter'
19:04 < nameless_tee32> most of them are blocekd
19:04 < nameless_tee32> the poitn is now i want add domain
19:05 < nameless_tee32> to people can easier join
19:06 <@matricks> so people can enter the domain name instead of ip?
19:06 < nameless_tee32> y
19:06 < nameless_tee32> it work but
19:06 < nameless_tee32> i want to people see domai name instead of ip on server list
19:06 <@matricks> can't be done
19:07 <@matricks> just put the domain name in the title
19:07 <@matricks> in the server name
19:07 <@matricks> and if people like your server they can favorite it
19:09 < nameless_tee32> itw as done
19:09 < nameless_tee32> at mpanic before
19:09 < nameless_tee32> they had tee.su:8303
19:55 < nameless_tee32> henrich
19:55 < nameless_tee32> well can you help me/
20:01 <@matricks> from what I know, teeworlds only stores ip addresses and not domains
20:01 <@matricks> perhaps favorites stores domains...
20:02 <@matricks> nameless_tee32: favorites can have hostnames
20:10 <@minus> favorites are a text file of commands, so yeah, that can store domains
20:10 <@minus> i think
20:12 <@heinrich5991> nameless_tee32: I believe the best thing you could do would be to ask your users to type "add_favorite your.domain:8303" into the local console (f1)
20:16 < nameless_tee32> i just want it
20:16 < nameless_tee32> cosue also its easier to stop ddoses
20:16 < nameless_tee32> cosue that russians idiots
20:16 < nameless_tee32> dont knowhow to check ip by doamin
20:16 < nameless_tee32> gg for them XD
20:16 < nameless_tee32> they wanted to ddos ts but they asked me for ip.. genious XD
20:16 < nameless_tee32> thats why i want domain in
20:16 <@matricks> lol
20:16 <@matricks> that wont help :D
20:16 < nameless_tee32> with that idiots will
20:16 < nameless_tee32> xD
20:17 < nameless_tee32> they are fucking kids with booter form ent
20:17 < nameless_tee32> and they dotn know how to chekc ip
20:17 < nameless_tee32> gg for them XD
20:17 < nameless_tee32> its rly hard to write in cmd ping domain name Xd
20:20 <@matricks> you can't make tw always show your domainname instead of ip
20:20 < nameless_tee32> uhm
20:20 < nameless_tee32> well i will try to contact with mpanic dev Xd
20:20 < nameless_tee32> couse he idd it so xd
20:21 <@matricks> doubt it
20:21 <@matricks> doesn't the ingame menu always show the ip for example?
20:21 <@matricks> the ip is always printed to the console apun connection etc
20:30 < nameless_tee32> well idk how it was workign
20:30 < nameless_tee32> but actually there was name
20:30 < nameless_tee32> of domain
20:31 <@matricks> see previous answer about favorites
20:40 < nameless_tee32> i want to everybody see doamin
20:40 < nameless_tee32> not favorites >D
20:40 <@matricks> can't be done
20:40 <@matricks> teeworlds doesn't do reverse loopups
20:40 < nameless_tee32> so how did he do it ?XD
20:41 <@matricks> I don't think he have done it
20:41 < nameless_tee32> 100% sure >D
20:41 <@matricks> the code isn't there to do it
20:41 <@matricks> the master servers only tracks ip addresses
20:41 < nameless_tee32> idk how he did it
20:41 < nameless_tee32> but it was for sure Xd
20:42 <@matricks> and I say it can't be done
20:42 < nameless_tee32> whatever
20:42 < nameless_tee32> its nosense for this arquee XD
20:42 <@matricks> arquee?
20:42 < nameless_tee32> dont you think ?X
20:42 < nameless_tee32> y couse im sure about my right and you are sure about your
20:42 <@matricks> well, I think you are hunting a ghost
20:43 <@matricks> how do you know that they have done that?
20:43 < nameless_tee32> the easier way was just go to server list and write .. mpanic`` ? Xd
20:43 < nameless_tee32> before they were at tee.su:8303 showing up
20:43 < nameless_tee32> but now its again ip
20:44 <@matricks> sure that someone didn't type in tee.se:8303?
20:44 < nameless_tee32> sure
20:45 <@matricks> only way is the favorites way
20:46 <@matricks> nameless_tee32: you mean the host address in the server browser right?
20:47 < nameless_tee32> yeah
20:48 <@matricks> can't be done
20:48 <@matricks> looking at the code at the moment
20:49 < nameless_tee32> :)
20:49 < nameless_tee32> im sure about my rirght
20:49 < nameless_tee32> >D
20:50 <@matricks> and I'm sure of what the code can do so
20:50 <@matricks> you just have words, I have the code
20:50 < nameless_tee32> matricks matricks D.
20:51 <@matricks> src/engine/client/serverbrowser.cpp:365
20:51 <@matricks> takes the address of the server (ip) and converts it into a string that will be displayed in the host address view
20:51 <@minus> nameless_tee32: keep in mind: matricks wrote that code/teeworlds
20:52 < masoudd> nameless_tee32: What client are you using?
20:52 < nameless_tee32> masouud own one
20:53 < masoudd> :|
20:53 <@matricks> then all bets are out the window
20:53 < masoudd> I don't have a client
20:53 < nameless_tee32> whatever matricks xd
20:54 <@matricks> I can tell you what teeworlds can and can't do, what other clients/servers can or can't do, well, I don't know and I don't keep track of em
20:55 <@matricks> the teeworlds client can only show the ipaddress+port in the host address box
20:55 <@matricks> I havn't seen any evidence that contradicts this at all and the code confirms this
20:57 <@matricks> can't find any online server that does what you are talking about as well
20:57 < nameless_tee32> whatever :P
20:58 <@matricks> I call it bullshit
20:58 <@minus> ^
