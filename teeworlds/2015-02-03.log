10:56 < JulianAssange> can someone run that on windowz
10:57 < JulianAssange> and tell me the result?
11:13 < EastByte> JulianAssange: PATH_MAX not declared
11:14 < JulianAssange> thought so
11:14 < JulianAssange> o well
15:24 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: Are you around? As I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly concerning issue 1314
15:25 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: that's because I don't understand the issue text, probably
15:26 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: what is the Z-order of quads?
15:26 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: 'drawing order' would probably be better
15:27 < BeaR_> which one is drawn on top of the others
15:27 < heinrich5991> ah, like the tile layers?
15:27 < BeaR_> y
15:27 < BeaR_> but you can rearrange the layers in the editors
15:27 < heinrich5991> and you can't rearrange quad layers in editor?
15:27 < heinrich5991> oh no
15:27 < BeaR_> sure but not the quads themself
15:27 < heinrich5991> you can't rearrange multiple quads in a single layer
15:27 < heinrich5991> ?
15:28 < BeaR_> yes
15:28 < heinrich5991> ok, I understood that.
15:29 < BeaR_> Going to update the issue text (:
15:31 < BeaR_> ah you wrote a comment
15:33 < BeaR_> would fix it myself but I'm rather busy atm /:
