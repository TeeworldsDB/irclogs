15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> piie, I'm also here now\:
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> I'd say since this device uses linux, it probably uses mesa and also implements OGL instead of GLES
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> I doubt vanilla teeworlds is compilable with GLES only, bcs GL\_QUADS and glOrtho don't exist in GLESAnyway, if you can open the terminal on your device you can request the supported OGL version
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> glxinfo \| grep stringgenerally vanilla should be compatible to OpenGL 1.2
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> e.g. adding```c
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> 	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION, 1);
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> 	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION, 2);
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> ```
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> might already fix the problem (add it in backend\_sdl.cpp before creating the window)
15:26 < piie> Hi Jupstar, thanks for your input. Haven't had time yet to get back to this topic yet.  But I'll for sure get back to that soon
