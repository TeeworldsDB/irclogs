01:04 < nameless_tee28>  /msg Q HELLO lostact@gmail.com lostact@gmail.com
19:59 < burt> so I guess teeworlds is dead now?
19:59 < burt> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/161980074176806912/479432476025159690/image.jpg
19:59 < burt> all servers are full 
19:59 < burt> ddos of fake users :/
20:00 < burt> all random IP addresses https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/161980074176806912/479708682268180481/teeworlds-ddos-user-spam.png
21:12 <+rand> it's time for favorites !
21:13 < burt> rand: how does favorites solve this? they took a list of servers from the master servers and are spamming them all with connections
21:14 < burt> even having a password on your server doesn't stop them from flooding connections
21:14 < burt> because teeworlds servers consider somebody connected as soon as the connection is open
21:17 <+rand> in fact, some server on favorite list are not or no longer register on master server
21:18 <+rand> i don't know why or how
21:18 <+rand> the script do not spam these ip
22:35 < Celmor> are servers currently being flooded/DDos'ed?
22:39 < burt> Celmor: yes there is a botnet flooding teeworlds servers with connections that timeout
22:39 < burt> so nobody can play on them
22:39 < burt> if you run a server you can change the port it runs on and the bots stop spamming you
22:39 < burt> seems like a very simple script kiddy 
22:41 <+rand> it seems like the script only gott a list of ip:port once
22:42 <+rand> i have just started a server, i'll check tomorrow if everything is fine
22:51 < Celmor> would it help to blacklist the IPs that try to connect to the tw server and timeout on a router level?
23:05 <@matricks> should redo the connection stuff and usage a challange
23:11 <+rand> too many thing to do
23:12 <+rand> i wonder how this could be integrate to 0.6 without backward issue
