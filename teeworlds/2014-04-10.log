14:28 <@matricks> minus: I just found something intressting :)
14:28 <@minus> matricks: that's very interesting to know!
14:28 <@matricks> minus: I found an old bitcoin wallet on my server :)
14:28 <@minus> :o
14:28 <@matricks> from 2011
14:29 <@minus> how many coins?
14:29 <@minus> not much i guess
14:29 <@minus> if it's from 2011
14:29 <@matricks> dunno :)
14:29 <@Kottizen> oooo
14:29 <@minus> what month?
14:29 <@minus> did you mine using GPUs?
14:30 <@minus> Kottizen: who are you?
14:31 <@minus> matricks: have fun with downloading up to 20GB of blockchain data
14:31 <@matricks> minus: ... dunno how to check how much is in that wallet :/
14:31 <@minus> start bitcoin client and drop it in ~/.bitcoin
14:32 < BotoX> upload the wallet.dat
14:32 <@minus> the other way around
14:32 < BotoX> and PM it to me
14:32 < BotoX> ~~~
14:32 <@matricks> minus: I'll do it when I get home :)
14:32 <@Kottizen> minus: I'm not the one I used to be \o/
14:32 <@matricks> I wonder if I have more laying around :D
14:33 <@matricks> can't I extract the address some easy way? :/
14:35 <@minus> there might be cmdline tools to quick-check it
14:36 <@matricks> 1CW5w1VJc8dKAF7sh6UbiKTUgrs3M82Efa
14:36 <@matricks> might be the wallet
14:36 <@Kottizen> hope that wasn't the private key :)
14:36 <@minus> just checked kewlers' rrhoid on ze android
14:36 < BotoX> https://blockchain.info/address/1CW5w1VJc8dKAF7sh6UbiKTUgrs3M82Efa
14:36 <@matricks> it's a wallet atleast
14:36 < BotoX> 0 BTC, try again?
14:37 <@matricks> I don't expect there to be any money
14:37 < BotoX> 0 transactions, looks like it's never been used
14:38 <@matricks> sound about right :)
