05:26 < nal3> so this is a question unrelated to teeworlds, but im wondering if there is a tool which allows one to prioritize network usage between applications, since i've noticed that tw only uses like 2kb per second
09:33 < deen> That's called traffic shaping and makes sense only at the spot where your line is the slowest, so usually the internet router. So many routers implement traffic shaping, but the quality varies a lot. I have good experiences with OpenBSD routers with PF
