14:10 <@heinrich5991> grass_main has a 2x2 black pixel in the top left and in the bottom right
14:10 <@heinrich5991> no other tileset has that
14:28 < deen> heinrich5991: top left shouldn't matter since it's not rendered anyway iirc
14:28 < deen> but can still be fixed of course
14:28 <@heinrich5991> yup, not rendered
14:29 <@heinrich5991> I wondered whether that's some kind of protection against copying ^^
14:29 < deen> how would that protect anything?
14:42 < deen> like the EURion constellation?
15:25 <@heinrich5991> deen: like knowing that somebody copied the tileset instead of repainting it, not sure
