21:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> What about using a .editorconfig ? https://editorconfig.org/
21:18 < Dune> the only valuable addition would be tab-4spaces, not sure if that's worth it
21:19 < Dune> (also, none of my editors support it)
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea idk how many editors support it but i saw it in a few big projects in the last days
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> could help avoiding the tabs issue
22:25 < Dune> havent seen a lot of confusion around tabs thankfully
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no not a lot for sure
23:10 < rand> could it be possible to have pre-commit hook on github instead ?
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> 5k commits \o/
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeay
23:14 < rand> *pre-receive
23:14 < rand> ok, it exists for GitHub Enterprise Server only
