20:17 < mivel> i need some help drawing freeform items
20:18 < mivel> i wanna make a mod where you can draw lines using your cursor, and a spinning bullet will represent each player's brush point
20:18 < mivel> for starters a simple line will follow the cursor
20:18 < mivel> and then be erased at the end
20:19 < mivel> or simply moved and constantly be bending to adjust to the movement of the brush
