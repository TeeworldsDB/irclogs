19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yo tw gurus? Is there something i have to know about Storage()->ListDirectory) ?
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i found this in skins.cpp
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Storage()->ListDirectory(IStorage::TYPE_ALL, "skins", SkinScan, this);
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and tried to copy it but i get a weird compile error i dont understand
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Something like no default syntax "&" on creating a link on a member. The error message is in german so i have trouble translating it -.-
19:21 < Oy> the "skinscan"-function has to be static and don't make the listdirectory call from a const function if use the this-pointer
19:24 <@Dune> hei
19:24 < Oy> hey
19:24 <@Dune> so we know the origin of 1 of the 2 problems of https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1775
19:24 < Oy> ?
19:25 <@Dune> do we?
19:25 < Oy> oh
19:25 < Oy> the problem savander writes about is that chat messages from empty names are dropped - the line i linked
19:26 <@Dune> alright
19:26 < Oy> the other is probably https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1817 https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1813
19:26 <@Dune> lots of weird stuff
19:26 < Oy> seems vital packets aren't delivered, which is really bad
19:26 <@Dune> :(
19:27 < Oy> the teamchange/leave message
19:27 < Oy> maybe have some time tomorrow to look into it
19:27 <@Dune> oh, cool
19:27 <@Dune> didn't think we'd see you on irc :)
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ty Oy the static part actually was the problem but Learath2 helped me already c:
