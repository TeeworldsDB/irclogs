17:37 < TeeUnity> Hey, can u unban my Server: ban 89.163.249.46 i will reduce the number.
18:49  * TeeUnity slaps heinrich5991 around a bit with a large fishbot
19:27 < swick> heinrich5991: just out of interest, you have access to the steamworks API documentation, right?
19:58 <@heinrich5991> swick: I think anyone can have access to it, as long as they confirm the NDA IIRC
19:59 < swick> heinrich5991: tried once but it didn't let me in. I guess you need a game on steam.
19:59 <@heinrich5991> yea, probably
20:03 < masoudd> Leak it!
20:04 <@heinrich5991> masoudd: just make a steam account and see it yourself?
20:05 < masoudd> Just kidding :D
20:10 < TeeUnity> heinrich5991: please unban my Server "ban 89.163.249.46" i change I will minimise the server number
20:10 <@heinrich5991> minus: ^
20:11 < TeeUnity> hm?
20:11 <@heinrich5991> I'm not the guy responsible for the master bans, minus is. I notified him of your request
20:11 < TeeUnity> okay ty
20:12 < Henningstone> heinrich5991: you may have used the ↑ -arrow ;) [don't ask me how this came to my mind now xD just have nothing to do...)
20:12 < Henningstone> øıµĸ
20:12 <@heinrich5991> that's not in ascii though :P
20:13 < Henningstone> but you can see it right? i mean it is supported is it?
20:13 <@minus> unbanned, might take a while
20:13 <@heinrich5991> yes, it is
20:13 < jxsl13> xD copy paste shell script
20:13 <@heinrich5991> but it's not directly on my keyboard
20:14 < Henningstone> on linux it is =)
20:14 <@heinrich5991> TeeUnity: see above
20:14 <@heinrich5991> Henningstone: only when having a layout with alt-gr, and then only with that key
20:14 <@heinrich5991> alt-gr+shift+u
20:14 <@heinrich5991> compare to
20:14 <@heinrich5991> ^
20:14 < Henningstone> heinrich5991: oh, you don't have alt alt-gr? that is confusing.
20:14 <@heinrich5991> I do :) but non-international english keyboards don't
20:15 < Henningstone> so we'd be happy with ours xD
20:15 < TeeUnity> minus "unbanned, might take a while"  why, if I'm allowed to ask ?
20:15 < Henningstone> Teetime: mastersrv needs to reload the ban list
20:15 <@minus> cause it takes a while
20:16 <@minus> up to 40 minutes
20:16 <@heinrich5991> a while means less than an hour I think
20:16 <@heinrich5991> because nothing gets a notification that something changed, they just repeatedly poll stuff
20:16 < jxsl13> [20:15:54] @minus:	cause it takes a while
20:16 < jxsl13>  xD
20:16 < Teetime> Henningstone, I'm probably not the guy you wanted :)
20:16 < jxsl13> as far as I remember you got some bash script running there, which copies the ban list to the server :D?
20:17 < Henningstone> Teetime: oh lol, sry ^^ there are two guys with names starting with "tee" XD
20:17 < jxsl13> hourly loop?
20:17 < Teetime> no problem :D
20:19 < TeeUnity> Okay, how many servers may I make in? Without that I 'm equal to banned?
20:19 < jxsl13> 1
20:19 < jxsl13> he he
20:20 < TeeUnity> :/
20:22 <@minus> TeeUnity: how about starting with one of each type and not 5 or more. and maybe scale up if they're not enough. but when i checked they were entirely empty, so i doubt that's gonna happen any time soon
20:27 < TeeUnity> minus: What is the problem Exact if i have many servers online?
20:28 <@minus> server list takes longer to load for one
20:29 < jxsl13> need multi world support
20:29 <@heinrich5991> in general we don't have anything against people hosting lots of servers. however, in this case they seemingly appeared out of nowhere, advertised a URL and were entirely empty
20:29 <@heinrich5991> this is a bad combination. maybe try to host a few servers only at first and expand afterwards? :)
20:30 < jxsl13> start with 5 and add 5 every day :D
20:30 < Henningstone> YOOOO why not multiply them every day?! xDD
20:31 < Henningstone> 2^X
20:31 < jxsl13> you should simply start with 2
20:31 < jxsl13> hm you speak what I think
20:32 < TeeUnity> yeah this is why my server are empty, i'm new
20:33 < TeeUnity> ^-^
20:34 < TeeUnity> Still if i have thus a big server, i would also like to use this.
20:36 < TeeUnity> I my 70 servers are for me nothing.
20:36 < WolfAlex_> jxsl13: perfect for you would be 1^(day_count) Servers! :p
20:37 < Henningstone> WolfAlex_: xD i am courious who gets it...
20:37 < jxsl13> like forevery 1 server?
20:37 < jxsl13> forever*
20:37 < Henningstone> ohh you got it :P
20:37 < WolfAlex_> :D
20:37 < jxsl13>  your server?
20:38 < Henningstone> whos?
20:38 < jxsl13> well, I'm hosting on his server
20:38 < WolfAlex_> <-
20:38 < jxsl13> so it has to be his server, which he means
20:38 < WolfAlex_> :( i meant 1 tw server 
20:38 < jxsl13> nah
20:38 < jxsl13> that won't happen x)
20:39 < Henningstone> →↓←↑
20:39 < WolfAlex_> > \/ < ^
20:39 < jxsl13> 1234
20:40 <@minus> TeeUnity: if everyone did that we'd have 10000 servers tho
20:40 < Henningstone> would be nice to have so much players, though :/
20:41 < TeeUnity> minus: yeah but it does nobody except me
20:41 < masoudd> minus: Do you have any stats on number of servers?
20:41 < masoudd> Is it growing? How fast?
20:42 <@minus> masoudd: no stats
20:43 < masoudd> Maybe divide the servers by country or continent if they grow too big
20:43 <@minus> nay
20:43 <@minus> i do have a master server implementation that theoretically speeds up server list loading
20:44 < masoudd> How does it speed up the process?
20:44 < jxsl13> scaling 
20:44 <@minus> sorting low-latency servers first
20:44 <@minus> i.e. those on the same continent
20:45 < masoudd> Well if the client pings every server then it wouldn't be faster. How does it matter which ones we ping first?
20:46 < Henningstone> they appear one after the other, not everything at once
20:46 < WolfAlex_> masoudd: there are only x requests parallel
20:46 <@minus> not faster but the list would fill faster
20:46 <@minus> lemme draw you something in paint
20:46 < TeeUnity> minus can u add me in skype?
20:46 <@minus> no
20:46 < jxsl13> yeah, paint
20:46 < TeeUnity> kk
20:46 < Henningstone> xD
20:47 <@heinrich5991> minus: netcat 1.105?
20:47 < masoudd> I see. I sort servers by ping. This way the top results will appear first and wouldn't change
20:47 < jxsl13> minus, can you try not to add me to skype?
20:47 <@minus> heinrich5991: yep.
20:48 < WolfAlex_> masoudd: try varying br_max_requests
20:48 < jxsl13> *being ignored - feels like being stabbed in the heart*
20:49 < jxsl13> maybe he s just drawing in paint
20:49 < Henningstone> jxsl13: "can you try not to add me". you _can_ only ignore it xD
20:49 < jxsl13> I kind of waited for a "yes, sure thing"
20:50 < Henningstone> means the same like "please don't add me" so why waste drawing-time to answer it xDD I can't stop laughing ;)
20:50 < masoudd> WolfAlex_: What does br_max_requests do?
20:50 < jxsl13> I am aware of the meaning...
20:51 < Henningstone> yeah and it was funny :) just enjoying it ;D
20:51 < jxsl13> compared to that answer [20:46:28] @minus:	no
20:51 < TeeUnity> minus: Can I make use of any MOD 5 server online?
20:51 < WolfAlex_> masoudd: maximal requests at the same time (or better: max. parallel requests)
20:51 < jxsl13> I feel even worse now than TeeUnity  should have felt
20:51 < Henningstone> jxsl13: pls don't >.>
20:51 < jxsl13> q.q
20:52 < Henningstone> >)ø_ø)>
20:52 < TeeUnity> o-Ö
20:52 < jxsl13> <(ö_ö(<
20:52 < Henningstone> I love these ... er... what exactly is it? xD
20:53 < jxsl13> I think before there were emojis, they were called something like smile ... maybe smileys
20:54 < Henningstone> I never used the word emojis. But these thingys doesn't smile… I'd call them "kirby", don't ask me why ^^
20:55 < WolfAlex_> ... kaomoji
20:55 < jxsl13> no idea how to call them, just asian online culture stuff
20:56 < jxsl13> lol
20:56 < jxsl13> they are called kaomoji xD
20:56 < jxsl13> (*ﾟｰﾟ)ﾉ	
20:56 < Henningstone> asians everywhere O_O ←(is this a omoji then?) uhh
20:57 < WolfAlex_> xD
20:57 < jxsl13> I think this is an omoji: ( • )( • )ԅ(‾⌣‾ԅ)	
20:58 < Henningstone> OH HOLY so much wow
20:58 < Henningstone> katze!
20:58 < jxsl13> such beauty, wow, much doge
20:58 <@minus> masoudd: here's your graph: https://sr.ht/-AI0.png
20:59 < masoudd> minus: Thanks, that's too good to have been done with paint though :D
20:59 < Henningstone> minus: did you attend to an mathematical arts school? ;D
20:59 < jxsl13> is was done in paint!
20:59 < jxsl13> one does not question the ways of a minus
21:00 < TeeUnity> minus: Can I make use of any MOD 5 server online?
21:00 <@minus> i ditched paint and went with matplotlib and numpy
21:01 < jxsl13> now you ruined the myth about yourself 
21:01 < Henningstone> jxsl13: busted again.
21:01 < jxsl13> mythbusters :O
21:01 <@heinrich5991> TeeUnity: what is a MOD 5 server? :)
21:01 < jxsl13> he means 5 modded servers, I suppose
21:01 <@minus> TeeUnity: i suggest you make 1 (maybe 2) servers for non-1on1 modes and maybe 5 for 1on1
21:01 < TeeUnity> okay
21:02 < TeeUnity> it's okay
21:02 < Henningstone> MOD5 sounds like a hack, don't believe him he'll get us all!
21:02 < Henningstone> <(O_O)>
21:03 < jxsl13> adios ...
21:34 < TeeUnity> minus: Let me know if you have unbanned them.
21:35 <@minus> they should be unbanned by now
21:35 <@minus> i did unban them immediately, it just takes up to 40 minutes to apply
23:47 <@matricks> mygod the git repo for teeworlds is huge :/
23:49 < TCT> Hi
23:49 <@matricks> hi!
23:50 < TCT> which would be the minimum requirements for a server?
23:51 < TCT> iam planing run the server on a arm cortex-a8 1ghz
23:51 <@matricks> I've ran it on a 200mhz arm... so :)
23:52 < TCT> ah ok, the mele a2000 will work 
23:52 < TCT> and use of bandwidth?
23:52 <@matricks> all depends on how many players
23:52 <@matricks> 3-5kb/s per player perhaps
23:52 <@matricks> depending on map etc as well
23:53 < TCT> kilobits per second or kilobytes per second?
23:53 <@matricks> bytes
23:54 <@matricks> a bit uncertain about those numbers, I would check a server and see
23:56 < TCT> damn third world connections... I doubt able to offer over 20 kb/s
23:57 < TCT> download is not the problem, upload is
23:57 <@matricks> upload is what a server needs
23:59 < TCT> I'll try, hopefully work well. Many thanks for your help matricks, cheers
23:59 <@matricks> I wouldn't setup a server that only has 20kb/s
