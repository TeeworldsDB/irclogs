13:46 < ChillerDragon> when i ctrl+c the client closes normally is this some SDL magic or did the tw code catch the SIGINT signal somewhere?
13:47 < ChillerDragon> hm maybe its the atexit call
13:49 < ChillerDragon> nah that does not catch signals
13:56 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> ChillerDragon: No, only terminal emulators send a SIGINT on Ctrl-C
13:56 < ChillerDragon> yes i use a terminal emulator
13:56 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> ah, OK
13:57 < ChillerDragon> i run it from my gnome terminal
13:57 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> well it certainly does close on SIGNIT
13:57 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> *SIGINT
13:57 < ChillerDragon> i mean i can kill it i just wonder how it closes gracefully
13:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> doesn't Teeworlds catch SIGINTs?
13:57 < ChillerDragon> i wonder where
13:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> just the same as alt+f4 or a click on the red cross
13:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> SDL_QUIT event probably?
13:57 < ChillerDragon> yes
13:57 < ChillerDragon> it is SQL_QUIT for sure
13:58 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> yup in src/engine/client/client.cpp:1921
13:58 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/c397fdf5a8bb8451f9a5ed5ef5571a000007792c/src/engine/client/input.cpp#L474 assume comming from here
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I have a dozen of matches for SDL_QUIT in Teeworlds
13:58 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> heh, you have a dozen? I get just 4
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah probably that
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> probably because I grep SDL include files :D
13:59 < ChillerDragon> well anyways seems to be SDL specific huh?
13:59 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> lol OK that makes sense :D
14:01 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> Dune, where are you sending your messages from? You come up as [teeworlds] <Dune> for me
14:01 < ChillerDragon> discord
14:02 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> ah, thanks
14:02 < ChillerDragon> would be nice if the server would also have that behaviour wouldnt it?
14:02 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> which behaviour? The server close on SIGINT, doesn't it?
14:02 < ChillerDragon> yea but it doesnt catch
14:03 < ChillerDragon> so CGameContext::OnShutdown() is not called for example
14:03 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> ah, right. Hmm...
14:06 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/740555190a7f98ba94862e8cd01bde1a19ee6d31/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1478 closing the econ connection and all the other things sounds like a nice thing todo on SIGINT
14:07 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> ChillerDragon, sounds like a good issue for GitHub, eh?
14:07 < ChillerDragon> yea right ima open one
14:07 < ChillerDragon> btw seabass can u send brain on how to use matrix?
14:07 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> I'm all for best practices, +1 ChillerDragon :D
14:07 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> yup I have brain to spare
14:08 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> Where are you up to so far with Matrix?
14:09 < ChillerDragon> element installed and logged in
14:09 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> ahah! So you can join a room by pressing the little + button on the panel on the right
14:10 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1616764121.png
14:10 < ChillerDragon> ?
14:10 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> yup that's the one
14:10 < ChillerDragon> so how do i get here? :D
14:10 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> well there's also a + button elsewhere
14:11 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1616764180.png
14:11 < ChillerDragon> i see 3 here
14:11 < ChillerDragon> people, rooms and communities
14:11 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> OK, so if you want to start a PM you use the people one
14:11 < ChillerDragon> i want to go here
14:11 < ChillerDragon> on this irc
14:11 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> OK, so you can click + on the rooms and the expore public rooms
14:12 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1616764251.png
14:12 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> aaaaa
14:12 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> yes
14:12 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> :)
14:12 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> time to delete irc xd
14:12 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> I guess it was just being a little slow then?
14:13 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> my brain was slow big time
14:13 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> Matrix does take a while to start federating, it's not just your brain :)
14:13 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> aw you have your cute profile picture on Matrix ^^
14:13 < ChillerDragon> meh cant find #ddnet
14:14 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> yeah, Freenode have an official Matrix bridge run by Matrix.org
14:14 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> I don't think quakenet have one
14:14 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ddnet is also freenode
14:14 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> so it's up to individual channels to operate one
14:14 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> ah, OK
14:14 < ChillerDragon> i think
14:14 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> #freenode_#ddnet:matrix.org
14:14 < ChillerDragon> can i join without exploring
14:14 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> yup as long as you use that address
14:15 < ChillerDragon> nice
