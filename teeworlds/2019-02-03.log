02:04 <@Dune> heinrich5991, why is Localize no longer in localization.h?
02:04 <@heinrich5991> it was declared in two places
02:04 <@heinrich5991> I kept the one that was used (gameclient.h)
02:04 <@Dune> it's an extern?
02:04 <@Dune> isn't it better to keep the extern and include localize.h?
02:04 <@heinrich5991> ("extern" is redundant)
02:05 <@heinrich5991> I considered doing that, it's also possible
02:05 <@heinrich5991> the current way you don't have to include localize.h in every file that includes gameclient.h
02:06 <@heinrich5991> doing it the other way would get the function declaration into the corresponding header file
02:06 <@heinrich5991> I can change it if you prefer the other way :)
02:07 <@Dune> I mean, sure, why not, it's most convenient
02:08 <@Dune> (the way you did it)
17:10 < TeeSlayer> Why does EMOTE_BLINK look so different in 0.7 compared to 0.6?
17:10 < TeeSlayer> https://lolinet.info/download/screenshots/emote_blink_new.png vs https://lolinet.info/download/screenshots/emote_blink_old.png
17:10 < TeeSlayer> different as in lower quality
17:12 < TeeSlayer> it also looks like that without ninja
17:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> hey teeslayer
17:16 < Oy> probably due different rendering
17:17 < TeeSlayer> hi fokkonaut
17:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> How do i support 64 players without hiding the server from the browser?!
17:38 < Oy> don't use an official gametype
17:46 < TeeSlayer> Oy: I think it's the right gametype, but he's porting a 0.6 modification I think^^
18:11 <@Dune> TeeSlayer, the point is that the server will not show up if you use an official gametype
18:16 < TeeSlayer> let's wait whether that solved fokkonaut's problem :)
18:16 < TeeSlayer> you're probably right though
18:26 < TeeSlayer> Will I actually get kicked/banned if I authenticate the rcon after the vote start?
18:28 < TeeSlayer> Because the server doesn't abort the vote.
18:28 < rand> iirc, the kick/ban command will fail
18:29 < rand> try kicknig yourself from rcon
18:30 < TeeSlayer> it's not that easy if you have the same IP address :)
18:30 < TeeSlayer> but good to know, thanks
18:30 < TeeSlayer> I think moving admins/mods to spec shouldn't be allowed either
18:30 < rand> you're right, that's not a good test
18:34 < rand> in fact, you can't kick yourself, you can't kick an authed client
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> TeeSlayer, no, i started this mod in 0.7 beta
18:36 < TeeSlayer> ah ok
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> How did you get the 64 player support? Mind creating a pullrequest?
18:37 < TeeSlayer> @fokkonaut is it the right gametype?
18:37 < rand> in variables.h, you can replace MAX_PLAYERS with MAX_CLIENTS
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ay
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thanksa
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thanks
18:37 < rand> for the sv_max_players variable
18:37 < TeeSlayer> @fokkonaut btw can you try to support the new map format, as used in the race by redix (or ddr by dune)
18:38 < TeeSlayer> for example have a look at the run_guy server
18:38 < TeeSlayer> https://lolinet.info/download/mapres/
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ?
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> rand, it still wont be shown
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> TeeSlayer how did you get it to work for the server you are hosting with my mod?
18:40 < rand> what is your setup ? gametype/max_players/max_clients ?
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Chilli (for now, will change it soon), 64, 64
18:40 < TeeSlayer> @fokkonaut I simply compiled it and started it. but for some reason it overwrote 64 player/clients with 16
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nope, you have 64 support
18:41 < TeeSlayer> ah true
18:41 < TeeSlayer> 64 client support
18:41 < TeeSlayer> but not players
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ah
18:41 < TeeSlayer> sv_player_slots 64 is in my chilli config
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> WTF
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ok ok
18:43 < TeeSlayer> I'm using the commit "add map"
18:44 < TeeSlayer> ok now the new commit, it seems to work
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no
18:45 < rand> @fokkonaut: is your server shown when sv_player_slots is lower than 16 ?
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
18:46 < rand> are you testing locally or online ? (for me to test)
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> local
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> lol?
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if i use a value < 16 it still shows 16, and if its > 16 the server wont be shown at all
18:48 < TeeSlayer> I thought it's fixed? My server has 64 clients and 64 players
18:48 < TeeSlayer> & it's shown
18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> idk but for me it doesnt seem to work
18:48 < rand> did you restart your server with max_clients = 64 ?
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i changed it in the code, not in the cfg
18:49 < rand> this can't be change at runtime
18:49 < rand> the default value is still 16
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i changed it
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in variables
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in variables.h
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `MACRO_CONFIG_INT(SvPlayerSlots, sv_player_slots, 64, 0, MAX_CLIENTS, CFGFLAG_SAVE | CFGFLAG_SERVER, "Number of slots to reserve for players")`
18:50 < rand> what about sv_max_clients ?
18:50 <@Dune> just change the MAX_PLAYERS #define ;)
18:50 <@Dune> ah nvm
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> doesnt work aswell
18:51 <@Dune> strange, should be straightforward
18:51 <@Dune> maybe because player slots is 16?
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i set it to 64
18:51 < rand> @fokkonaut: what about sv_max_clients ?
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> where should that be?
18:52 < rand> in your config
18:52 <@Dune> ah, this was sv_players_slots, my bad
18:52 < rand> like sv_player_slots
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its 64
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i told you already :)
18:53 < rand> you show me the line with sv_player_slots so I thought there was a misunderstanding ^^
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so i can change the MAX_PLAYERS to 64, but when i change it in the variables.h it will not show the server. if i manually connect it will show 1/0 players in the server info tab
18:55 < rand> do you have python ?
18:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes, sure
18:56 < rand> from the "scripts" folder, run it (interactively), then "import tw_api; print(tw_api.get_server_info(('localhost',8303)))" should help
18:56 < rand> there is something wrong with what your server send
18:57 < rand> probably saying that it has more player_slots than possible clients or something like that
18:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> how
18:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ah
18:59 < rand> you should get what your server send with the script, then compare with what you expected versus what you get
18:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it says "None"
18:59 < rand> meh
18:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> probably because i based my mod on 0.7 beta
18:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ima try something
19:00 < rand> with both config (the one that appears in the server browser, the the other one) ?
19:02 < rand> (you may want to decomment lines 169-171 in scripts/tw_api.py if you still get None)
19:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> fixed it
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i dont know what was the problem, but i just took my source and pasted it into the current twsource
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it was because there was still stuff from 0.7 beta
19:03 < rand> better rebase your work on 0.7.1 (or earlier) :)
19:05 < TeeSlayer> @fokkonaut I created an issue :P
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ah still doesnt work
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> fml, i dont crae
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> fml, i dont care
19:09 < rand> just check your server answer :)
