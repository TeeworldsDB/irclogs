12:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <gerdoe> older
12:53 < seabass> Hello everyone!
12:57 < seabass> I have just added a link to Teeworlds' IRC channels in its page on the Free Software Directory:
12:57 < seabass> https://directory.fsf.org/wiki?title=Teeworlds
12:57 < ChillerDragon> nice
12:57 < seabass> :) little changes add up on Wikis!
12:57 < ChillerDragon> it also somehow is on freenode btw bridged to quakenet and discord seabass 
12:58 < ChillerDragon> and lul what is teeworlds-dev
12:58 < seabass> ah, really, I didn't know that. Thanks
12:58 < ChillerDragon> i think #teeworlds-dev is like unofficial never seen that before anywhere
12:58 < ChillerDragon> dev stuff is usually here 
12:58 < seabass> ah, OK - I just found it in the /list output
12:59 < seabass> So do you contribute to Teeworlds, ChillerDragon?
13:00 < ChillerDragon> yea mostly typos xd
13:00 < ChillerDragon> lol the ruby gem
13:00 < ChillerDragon> didnt know that
13:00 < ChillerDragon> well 2013 that was before my time
13:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> do you just add typos to the code
13:00 < ChillerDragon> yes
13:00 < seabass> aha, well you deserve my graditude either way :D
13:00 < ChillerDragon> and update license year
13:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> you are doing god's work here
13:02 < seabass> At some point I need to practice my grapple-hooking :)
13:02 < ChillerDragon> oh u play? nice
13:02 < ChillerDragon> how long?
13:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> forgot about irc people, here's our (chinese community) new-year screenshot comprised of 565 tees:
13:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> https://teeworldscn.github.io/EventScreenshots/2021newyear/
13:03 < seabass> yup I found it about two months ago
13:03 < ChillerDragon> is it a real screen with a server that support 568 tees? o.O
13:03 < ChillerDragon> seabass: whats ur ingame?
13:03 < seabass> at the Debian MiniDebConf for gaming - it's now one of my favourite games!
13:03 < ChillerDragon> nice to hear
13:03 < seabass> (they had a WAN party)
13:03 < fstd> http://penenen.de/twparticle.png i'll just leave this here
13:03 < fstd> haven't counted tho
13:04 < ChillerDragon> weird flex
13:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> it is made of real screenshots. server's still up (ddnet only tho)
13:04 < seabass> ChillerDragon, I don't usually have a nick in-game
13:04 < ChillerDragon> oh sad
13:04 < fstd> this pic is like 6 years old
13:04 < ChillerDragon> u should get active again fstd 
13:04 < ChillerDragon> i love ur family friendly name btw xd
13:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> ðŸ¤”
13:05 < fstd> tw collision detection would need an overhaul to make a shitton of tees actually feasible
13:05 < seabass> I learnt to swing pretty well from watching the combined skill on your server, ChillerDragon :) CTF5 is great for that
13:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i just disabled collisions between online players
13:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but tees are pins, not online players, you can pin yourself onto the map.
13:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> seabass: ChillerDragon: #teeworlds-dev was the official channel but it got merged with #teeworlds since people started talking about one in the other
13:08 < ChillerDragon> xd @fokkonaut lets deactive collision in F-DDrace to fix lags :brain:
13:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Back when matricks was around
13:09 < ChillerDragon> yea too many channels suck
13:09 < ChillerDragon> fstd: so old
13:09 < seabass> Dune, Would you like to me to remove the teeworlds-dev channel from FSD, or is it something you'd like to revive?
13:09 < ChillerDragon> we could bridge that to #development on discord
13:09 < ChillerDragon> would be nice
13:09 < ChillerDragon> and revive it
13:09 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991
13:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It was merged for a reason
13:09 < ChillerDragon> oke
13:10 < ChillerDragon> seabass: Dune is big boi here btw very active pro dev
13:10 < seabass> ah yes, I've seen the blog posts by Dune :)
13:10 < seabass> But again, I can remove the teeworlds-dev link from the Directory if you'd like
13:11 < ChillerDragon> yo seabass u should use and keep the name seabass in game so ppl recognize u :3
13:11 < seabass> hehe the invisible tee
13:11 < seabass> or at least unidentifiable tee
13:17 < seabass> Anyway, I need to go now. Dune: If you want to remove the IRC link to teeworlds-dev, it's a public Wiki, or you can just ask me. :)
13:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> fstd with that many tees in close proximity Iâ€™m not quite sure any naive rework of physics like chunking would help. Maybe a quadtree could have good enough performance characteristics, though those are not cheap to update so maybe not?
13:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Would be an interesting challange to get 128 tees on a server colliding like that without turning the performance to shit
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Space hashing with very small chunks could work, though with very small chunks you get a massive hashmap, might not fit in a cache line
13:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> ~~conclusion: don't~~
13:57 < fstd> Learath2: quadtree is what i was gonna do back then
13:58 < fstd> i didn't, for some reason
13:58 < fstd> but it was the plan
20:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://www.mediafire.com/file/b3ks0nr4m4iknv0/How_to_make_a_teeworlds_server.zip/file    @heinrich5991
