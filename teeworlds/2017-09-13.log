17:20 < nemo2> Hey guys.  I'm from #hedgewars on freenode
17:20 < nemo2> We're finally finally inching towards a release
17:21 < nemo2> And, well, sometime after our last release, sheepluva stripped all of our SDL1.2 code out. SDL2 became the only option (up until then we could flag it, and was usually only used for mobile)
17:21 < nemo2> this pretty quickly exposed a bug that was fairly low on radar since it seemed to only impact me.  That 3+ byte UTF-8 sequences were getting mangled inbound from SDL
17:22 < nemo2> Recently alfadur (chinese dev) confirmed it was impacting his CJK input too, which raises priority a bit
17:22 < nemo2> well... in searching for any clues on this I found:
17:22 < nemo2> https://ddnet.tw/irclogs/2015-08-25.log
17:22 < nemo2> which seems to be you guys discussing this exact same problem
17:22 < nemo2> I was wondering if you'd found a solution
17:23 < nemo2> s/from SDL/from SDL2/
17:39 < deen> nemo2: hi
17:39 < deen> That log is actually from over on #ddnet, but anyway
17:39 < nemo2> oh
17:39 < nemo2> I saw teeworlds in it, so figured it was your codebase
17:40 < deen> I'm here as well, and teeworlds switched to SDL2 as well
17:40 < deen> oh, more than 2 years old, let me read that first
17:41 < nemo2> just searched ddnet issue list and couldn't find anything 
17:43 < deen> would first be good to try if alfadur has problems with CJK input in ddnet. I think our state is not that great, so we'd appreciate some help as well :D
17:43 < deen> and using a recent sdl2 version is important, I remember reporting some double encoding issues and they fixed them upstream
17:43 < nemo2> oh?
17:44 < nemo2> deen: recent as in what version?
17:44 < deen> 2.0.5
17:44 < nemo2> deen: ok. so this was definitely talking about a ddnet and not teeworlds issue then, for testing purposes
17:44 < deen> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/74f4ad77d61d0d620431c317156f8dc9e06151d6
17:44 < deen> yeah
17:44 < deen> Teeworlds doesn't have a released version with SDL2 yet, I believe
17:44 < nemo2> ah
17:44 < nemo2> yeah. we were fine up until we did that
17:48 < deen> https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3102
17:48 < nemo2> awesome!
17:48 < nemo2> hm
17:48 < nemo2> think I found that one before tho
17:49 < deen> so i actually reported that but google doesn't index bugzilla.libsdl.org apparently
17:49  * nemo2 checks logs
17:49 < nemo2> nope. I didn't
17:49 < deen> we also did other stuff to fix the utf8 handling
17:49 < deen> but I don't remember where exactly
17:49 < deen> or text input handling*
18:04 < nemo2> thanks a lot.  I'm on 2.0.2 (ubuntu trusty) and alfadur is on 2.0.3 (suse)
18:04 < nemo2> so. that could be the problem right there
18:04 < deen> yeah, but setlocale(LC_ALL, "") should work as a workaround
18:07 < deen> Also, funny coincidence that you're here from hedgewars. I recently told people to try hedgewars when they had problems in DDNet because I thought the problem is in SDL2, not DDNet, and you guys use SDL2 too :D
18:07 < nemo2> haha
18:07 < nemo2> no. we are still on SDL 1.2
18:07 < deen> good to know!
18:07 < nemo2> but 0.9.23 will be SDL2
18:07 < nemo2> I was pissed that he stripped out entirely the SDL1.2 code
18:08 < nemo2> I wanted him to ifdef it
18:08 < nemo2> but he was on a rampage
18:08 < deen> haha
18:08 < nemo2> and unfortunately I didn't push back until too much new stuff had gotten stacked ontop
18:08 < deen> well, you have a git history I hope
18:08 < nemo2> hg history
18:08 < nemo2> but yes
18:08 < nemo2> it's still a pain
18:08 < deen> But yeah, SDL2 port has pissed of some of our players as well
18:08 < deen> some still use the old SDL1.2 version :/
18:08 < nemo2> due to extensive changes in that area merging the new stuff I want to keep would be tedious
18:08 < deen> mostly because of mouse input differences
18:08 < nemo2> mm
18:09 < nemo2> yeah. dunno. that could end up biting us too
18:12 < deen> matricks, minus: there are no logs of this channel? I have them since 2014. Would you mind if I host them over on https://ddnet.tw/irclogs/teeworlds ?
18:16 <@minus> i don't particularly mind
18:20 < nemo2> huh. are these 2 projects linked?
18:20 < nemo2> I'm unfamiliar w/ ddnet
18:20 < deen> Teeworlds is the original project, a 2D shooter
18:20 < deen> then someone made a race mod, then cooperative race (ddrace), then that became ddnet
18:20 < nemo2> ahhh
18:20 < nemo2> and the mod turned into an official fork/new project
18:21 < nemo2> we have a race room on our server â˜º
18:21 < deen> well, we're still compatible
18:21 < nemo2> but it's obv turn based
18:22 < deen> and it's basically impossible to play on ddnet without lots of teeworlds experience
18:22 < deen> unintuitive controls, no tutorial, etc
18:24 < nemo2> heh
18:24 < nemo2> not that different from hedgewars
18:25 < nemo2> no one can be bothered to write documentation and tutorials
19:20 <@heinrich5991> oh, a visit from friendly neighbours :)
19:38 < nemo2> hiiii
19:38 < nemo2> I kept meaning to ask you guys about this
19:38 < nemo2> but was too lazy to rejoin quakenet
19:38 < nemo2> was already on gimpnet and moznet and freenode and things were getting crowded
19:39 <@heinrich5991> where is hedgewars?
19:39 < nemo2> irc://irc.freenode.net/hedgewars
19:39 < nemo2> like many other FOSS projects
19:39 < nemo2> aaand a few non-FOSS to whom a blind eye is turned
19:39 < nemo2> #minecraft has minecraft dev in it, but squeaks through due to being the "Reddit group"
19:40 < nemo2> Starbound I think no one has bothered enforcing yet
19:40 < nemo2> They both support linux so maybe have some distro interaction that way
23:26  * Axaris slaps keep around a bit with a large fishbot
23:27 < keep> xD
