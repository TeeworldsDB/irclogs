12:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune ur the compose bind expert huh?
12:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ``bind shift+t chat_all`` does not work for me. What am i doing wrong? :c
12:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Is lshift or rshift bound
12:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Try setting in the UI
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah true its lshift not shift omg me nobo
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> meh ``key lshift not found``
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the modifier is `shift`, the key is `lshift`
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Hmm seems like ``chat_all`` can only be bound from ui?
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> That is unlucky because i need two chat binds
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> shouldn't be the case
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> UI is just a wrapper
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea i thought so
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but even ``bind x chat_all`` doesnt work
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> if the ui says t
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> because chat_all is not a command?
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> might be
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah true its ``chat all`` oh wow sowwy
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah do a dump_binds :)
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea did and red wrong
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yay finally :)
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> thanks @Dune
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> np
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Is it intentional that the join/leave chat message do not show up in the logs? I used them for my econ mod :c
15:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Is it to remove redundancy? I think its a bit weird that other chat messages show up but not the join/leave messages.
15:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> server chat messages show up?
15:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> It uses ``m_pChat->AddLine(-1, 0, aBuf);`` directly and not the SendChat() function that adds logs
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh wait it sthat clientside?
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes it is
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> for localization i see.. but a bit weird to have a "server" message client sided
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's not the only one. flag capture messages, etc
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yikes
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not too nice imo
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> why not? it localizes
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Id prefer people learning enlish while having the benfit as server modder to have control over messages.
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> "learning enlish" nice one xd
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> "I prefer people learning english" is an argument against the whole localization system, and we chose to go with it
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> You still have control over server messages
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yea ikr. But I mean messages in chat that are marked as server messages are ok in english imo. But like the menu and so on is nice if it is localized.
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I mean 0.6 was pretty clear yellow messages with  *** were server. And that made sense.
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Now this clearness is gone. :c
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> They still are server messages
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Just they are localized
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I guess i have to rewrite my whole system then :c
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> huh?
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> You can always send the message as plain english text if you're really deeply against translations
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Hm yea in a modded server i guess.
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But for my vanilla extension i have to rethink this part https://github.com/chillavanilla/TeeworldsEconMod/blob/master/src/player.py#L121
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there should be indicators in the log that a player joined, without that message
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But they are the same on join and change team
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that is not the indicator
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well currently not.... but they should be as you mentioned
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I did not say impossible just rethink. Well I guess that is fine. I expected work when porting to 0.7. Its more like the feeling i have about this translation system that i wanted to mention. But it is probably fine how it is currently I just have to get used to it.
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh and i thought duplicated names were removed?
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think so yeah
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yea same but is it a config or something because i got duplicated names on latest master
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Seems it was only empty nicknames: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2062
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ah seems like we both confused that one
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oy: can we get back (x) in front of duplicated names?
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> would make things a lot easier and imo also a better user expierence
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> don't ping people on IRC if you don't know they are there
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> made that for my mod, including confusables
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> highly wanted, as duplicate and empty nicks break whisper
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> mind doing a pr? @fokkonaut
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oof
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> pok
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ok
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> vanilla prs ðŸ˜„ a classical waste of time.
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> huh?
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hater @jxsl13 :c
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> huh?
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> personal experience ðŸ˜®
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> without contributions, there would be no teeworlds ;)
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> feel free not to contribute to teeworlds, but be respectful to those who do
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> did I do anything disrespectful?
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I contribute, but not in the form of prs
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> btw
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> your PRs will have a higher chance of being accepted if they fix a validated issue. If you are worried your work will not go through, open an issue first.
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> everything done, still a waste of time :o, I'm only opening issues thath come across my way or bugs that come across my way when modding the server side stuff.
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> my way of contributing.
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> how is it a waste of time to contribute to teeworlds?
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> work -> argue -> implement -> nope
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yea that can be unsatisfying.
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> again, if you discuss what you want to do in an issue first, no wasted work :)
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Well discussion is also time and emotions invested. But not wasted imo.
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there is literally nobody to discuss stuff with, if only either you or Oy are the counterpart that discussion happens with.
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and Oy doesn't even play the game?
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does he?
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> dont think so xd
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> five different people replied to the only one PR you wrote
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But tbh I didnt play since weeks. You can still be invloved.
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if you want to avoid frustration, open issues first
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm opening issues, but not wasting any more time than that ðŸ˜„
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ™‚
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if an issue is validated, your PR will be merged, unless there is a technical issue
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> "validated" what's that supposed to mean?
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> tagged
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> in this context?
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> with something else than "discussion needed"
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm k.
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> any work you do on labeled issues here: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues will definitely merged, or we will help you sort any technical issues with pleasure
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if you are interested to implement a particular feature in Teeworlds, you can open an issue there first, and wait for validation. That's what I do when I work on something that I am not sure if it will be accepted
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I got very frustrated when I first wrote PRs years ago, so I understand your sentiment
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> But when you get to know how github works, things are very smooth :) of course I still sometimes scrap work here and there
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> With respect to gameplay, Oy usually defers any issue/decision to our vanilla experts
16:33 < rand> working on one's mod is good enough, as long as author agrees it (or license), teewords source base can benefit from it later
16:34 < rand> cherry picking from other's repo â™¥
16:36 < rand> it reminds me to cherry pick from ddnet serverinfo_extended
16:40 < Dune> what does it do?
16:43 < rand> it allows server with more than 27 players to anounce themselves correctly
16:44 < rand> in fact, in a some situation, a server with many players drops its server info packet because it is too big
16:45 < rand> it may occur with nearly full ddnet server
16:45 < Dune> ooh, I think I read that somewhere, probably from you :)
16:46 < rand> :)
16:46 < rand> heinrch5991 documented this so it should be easy to draft a PR, I didn't though :x
16:47 < rand> I'm still concerned about the spectator thing, as a different type of client (instead of a player with spectator state)
16:48 < Dune> the spectator thing?
16:52 < rand> about a strong separation between player and spectators
16:53 < Dune> interesting, from a technical pov only?
16:55 < rand> yes
16:55 < rand> iirc, there was a server modification for some teeworlds tournament
16:55 < rand> allowing may spectators
16:55 < rand> *many
16:58 < rand> I don't find the last discussion about it, I should forget it 
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Hmm i added some lib regex to src/engine/external/regex/regex.c
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but my bam says it does not exist or no way to gernate it
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> regex = Compile(settings, "src/engine/external/regex/*.c")
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> in my bam.lua any ideas?
20:17 < Dune> you're lacking a dependency
20:17 < Dune> bam has tools to help with that
20:17 < Dune> run with --debug-nodes-html
20:18 < Dune> what files does not exist?
20:18 < Dune> regex.c?
20:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ya
20:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> bam: error: 'src/engine/external/regex/*.c' does not exist and no way to generate it
20:28 < redix> use regex = Compile(settings, "src/engine/external/regex/regex.c")
20:29 < redix> or regex = Compile(settings, Collect("src/engine/external/regex/*.c")) when it is more than one file
22:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh Collect() thanks didnt see that
