02:24 < v0idpwn> So.. I failed making the language selector (SORRY ;-;), maybe I try again one day. But I've got another question, I've seen in the goals for 0.7.0 a windows installer, is this real?
02:27 < v0idpwn> I have found an installer developed by Minus on forums, I know how to use NSIS (its simple) and I may update it for 0.7.0 with some new features
02:30 <@heinrich5991> I'm not sure whether that's the official plan (ask oy!), but a working installer is definitely a big plus :)
02:30 <@heinrich5991> so go ahead and do it
02:30 <@heinrich5991> and I'm off, good night :)
02:31 < v0idpwn> Sure! I've got only weekends, but I can do it relatively fast. I'm leaving, need to sleep, I'm gonna travel tomorrow. Cya :D
