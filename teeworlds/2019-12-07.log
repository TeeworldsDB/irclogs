14:13 < FrozenFox> Hello world.
14:13 < FrozenFox> https://teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=rules/server_rules
14:14 < FrozenFox> The server rules say a modified teeworlds cannot host the standard gametypes. Is this rule so strict as to deny a modified server from adding additional gametypes without modifying the original?
14:16 < FrozenFox> I'd like to host a multi-mode server with the standard and a few extra gametypes. The standard being completely vanilla and unmodified.
14:17 < FrozenFox> The alternative would require running the vanilla server alongside it and being forced to switch over manually to the other server for the standard modes.
14:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> you mean as long as sv_gametype is a standard gametype the server behaves exactly as vanilla but there is also sv_gametype mod?
14:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sounds legal to me
14:20 < FrozenFox> ChillerDragon: Awesome. I've seen your name around a fair bit. Safe to say your approval suffices? :D
14:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But idk the border somewhat is to actually not modify the server code at all :/
14:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no
14:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not save
14:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im not your lawyer :/
14:21 < FrozenFox> Hehe
14:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i am just guessing
14:21 < FrozenFox> Okay
14:22 < FrozenFox> Next question. Why would the ddnet client fail to connect to a new vanilla teeworlds server?
14:22 < FrozenFox> Was there a breaking change between versions?
14:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well ddnet is still for 0.6 and vanilla updated to 0.7 which is a breaking realease last year
14:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> time to advertise my crappy and incomplete ddnet client port to 0.7 again https://zillywoods.github.io/ZillyWoods-web/
14:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd
14:25 < FrozenFox> ooo
14:26 < FrozenFox> Any chance of the non-entities features going vanilla?
14:27 < FrozenFox> and non-dummy
14:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not really
14:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> most of them do not fit vanilla
14:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> The greensward skin might get vanilla
14:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also cl_showpred  could fit in vanilla
14:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> there was a no already to 64p scoreboard
14:28 < FrozenFox> showpred is my main interest from that list
14:28 < Dune> Hello FrozenFox 
14:28 < FrozenFox> and zoom and showhookcoil :)
14:28 < FrozenFox> Hello Dune 
14:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i can do a pr for showpred
14:28 < Dune> It's a bit of an edge case but you'll be fine :) thanks for taking a thorough read through the rules
14:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> zoom and hookcoll are considered cheats in vanilla
14:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and gameplay changing that wont happen
14:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also zillywoods zoom does not work on non ddrace servers
14:29 < FrozenFox> They can be blocked by the client on the official modes
14:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> to avoid cheating
14:29 < FrozenFox> Just like that
14:29 < FrozenFox> ddnet's client restricts zoom too
14:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
14:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> zilly works like ddnet
14:29 < Dune> @ChillerDragon: the 64p scoreboard is planned, but not the way ddnet did it
14:30 < Dune> just with pages
14:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2262
14:30 < FrozenFox> How different is 0.6 -> 0.7 ?
14:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not too much
14:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> info changes like name clan and skin are impossilbe without reconnect
14:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> there is a new skin system and a new gametype
14:30 < Dune> skin is possible
14:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ok skin is now possible
14:30 < Dune> only name and clan are immutable identities
14:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but due to oudated servers and clients not too good
14:31 < Dune> full list of changes: https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=news&id=12605
14:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well it depends in what differences you are interested in the breaking protocol changes or all changes
14:31 < Dune> @ChillerDragon right but the clients and servers broadcast their version so you can tell
14:32 < FrozenFox> What about antiping? I'm in Australia... it is a life saver to have as there aren't even any aussie servers at the moment..
14:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Dune go update ddr :p
14:32 < FrozenFox> **surrounded by lots of water**
14:32 < Dune> antiping is just "better predict"
14:32 < Dune> no one ported it to 0.7 yet
14:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> antiping is very high on my todo but since i already failed porting it i do not expect to much very soon
14:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> too*
14:32 < Dune> it is not an easy task
14:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> much wowo english
14:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> it really isn't
14:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it should just be copieng code from ddnet^
14:33 < Dune> the last ddnet rewrite should be there: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/0b3f3b
14:33 < Dune> good luck "just copying code from ddnet" :D
14:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well i usually go from bottom to top in the whole history
14:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> to keep original commit authors
14:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but ye ikr i tried it already and it was a mess
14:34 < FrozenFox> It'd be really nice if network jitter and lag didn't contribute to solo play in races.
14:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes i was told multiple times that ddnet antiping is a game changer and reason number 1 for not updating to 0.7
14:35 < FrozenFox> That it is..
14:35 < Dune> @ChillerDragon: ah, you successfully merged?
14:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well it compiles
14:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but you know the one flag is used twice
14:36 < Dune> "compiles" is not that hard to achieve
14:36 < Dune> "doesnt break" is :p
14:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> check pm for the issue
14:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and blamed commits
14:37 < Dune> ah, didnt see sry
14:37 < Dune> those flags are unrelated to my mods though afaik
14:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/commit/263f474c0256c0934b1849264c9dc09a3953e2f0
14:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its from race
14:38 < Dune> ahh
14:38 < Dune> then it's tricky
14:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ikr
14:38 < Dune> redix will suffer the merge too
14:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> do it well ur fork is most forked 0.7 fork
14:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd
14:39 < Dune> yeah I'll do it in time
14:39 < Dune> deadline for 0.7.4 major changes is the 10th, though :)
14:39 < FrozenFox> The biggest game changer for me at the moment would be to buy a mouse ;)
14:39 < FrozenFox> (trackpad play isn't as bad as you'd think...)
14:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> haha i switched to touchpad again
14:39 < Dune> huuuh
14:39 < Dune> well you can use the joystick instead I guess :P
14:40 < Dune> (wouldnt recommend)
14:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i played my first full year tw with mousepad and i was way better with touchpad than mouse back then xxD
14:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> now that im always travelin around with laptop i went back to touchpad
14:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> touchpad not mousepad*
14:40 < Dune> huuuh
14:40 < Dune> impressuve
14:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> just a matter of training
14:41 < FrozenFox> ChillerDragon: I mostly play ddnet so... trackpad + >200ms ping isn't too bad but I was much better with a mouse
14:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> if you can trust sketchy unproofed sources some pro gores/ddrace players are touchpad mains
14:41 < FrozenFox> neat
14:41 < FrozenFox> But low latency probably..
14:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh yea i also play with hotspot from my phone xd
14:42 < FrozenFox> Anyone in here remember the n-lvl servers?
14:42 < Dune> o/
14:42 < FrozenFox> I plan to bring that back as open source. Starting with clean 0.7 sources.
14:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nice
14:43 < FrozenFox> Was messing around on a monster server yesterday. So sad that noise is the closest we have to n-level today....
14:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i dont think so
14:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lum lvl got open src latley as far as i know
14:44 < FrozenFox> Hm?
14:44 < Dune> 0.6 stuck around for an abnormal long time, and so it had exceptional community content
14:44 < FrozenFox> I heard something about LUM but didn't see any servers running or ...wait I searched from ddnet/0.6 
14:44 < Dune> yeah thats 0.7
14:44 < FrozenFox> !!!!!
14:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> !!!!!
14:44  * FrozenFox is on LUM now
14:46 < FrozenFox> one kill maybe..?
14:46 < FrozenFox> wow
14:55 < FrozenFox> ahh the memories.. okay.. so this is open you say?
15:01 < Dune> https://github.com/VeH-c/LUM-Lvl-0.7.2 maybe
15:16 < FrozenFox> Lookslike it:O
15:17 < FrozenFox> No git history :(
15:24 < Dune> you can still get the diff
15:24 < FrozenFox> yeah but not as nice
