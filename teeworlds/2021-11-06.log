19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <visitOP> idk  6 months maybe x)
19:14 < minus> cool feature of irc: you can't edit your messages
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <visitOP> well in matrix you can in a certain way, you have the ""edit" button but when you edit it just delete your message from discord and replace it by ur new one
22:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> Discord can edit too. I think what minus is trying to say is\: please do not edit the messages here itâ€™s annoying to get them re send on irc
22:57 < minus> that's true, but i didn't mean to imply that
22:57 < minus> not being able to edit messages is fine too
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <visitOP> oh yeah it send it 2 times on irc i see
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <visitOP> sorry then aha
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> minus being very passive aggressive haha
23:06 < minus> stop putting words in my mouth
