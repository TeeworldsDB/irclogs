10:55 < ChillerDragon> Learath2: are there enums for max command and arg lengths?
11:02 < ChillerDragon> Oh btw entering a command that requires args like '/whisper' and then pressing enter causes this https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/Z5
11:02 < ChillerDragon> is the command actually called? and if so is that wanted behavior?
11:19 < Kottizen> ChillerDragon: I only host the server behind teeworlds.com; I don't have access to the domain. Perhaps minus has?
11:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> minus perhaps, but definitely also matricks
11:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> maybe only matricks, even
11:22 < minus> what's this about?
11:23 < Kottizen> There was a suggestion:
11:23 < Kottizen> ChillerDragon | what do you guys think about getting github.com/teeworlds verified?
11:24 < Kottizen> ChillerDragon | https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/verifying-your-organizations-domain
11:24 < Kottizen> Ah, now I just saw that you already replied!
11:24 < minus> oh, but that was days ago
11:24 < Kottizen> On IRC, I work in days rather than in minutes. :)
11:48 < Learath2> ChillerDragon: it's expected, we should probably show the error in a visual way but I couldn't figure out a good way
11:48 < Learath2> The command callback is never called, parsing fails
12:03 < Dune> Kottizen, ChillerDragon: it's not really relevant as far as I remember, all we need is control over info@teeworlds.com, which we have plenty of
12:03 < Dune> We already did that for the discord
13:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon i tried to reproduce the master problem local with 1000 accounts, but it still found masters
13:07 < ChillerDragon> Learath2 k I just assumed the command to be executed when I see it in the log or do not see it in the log when i see nothing in the UI
13:07 < ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut seems to be a specific account value then i gues
13:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i had 11 more than on the live server
13:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> btw, can you check your emails? i wrote one to you
13:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Said that I needed to force push xd
13:08 < ChillerDragon> get irc bro or wire 
13:08 < ChillerDragon> email sokk :D
13:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Junge get discord
13:09 < ChillerDragon> got no mail btw and no i am not planing to get discord any time soon
13:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> chillerdragon@gmail.com isnt correct?
13:10 < ChillerDragon> it is i got a mail from u this morning but not another one
13:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> did you receive one?
13:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yesterday was the record day Chiller, 94 players at the same time on the server ^^
13:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Can you fix the build Chiller?
13:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Due to force push its broken
16:48 < Th3_l5D> hello
16:49 < Th3_l5D> sorry for the hello/I've got a question/Thanks for your reply/bye :)
16:50 < Th3_l5D> I just set up a private teeworlds server, and I'm looking for a way to have some user stats on a webpage
16:50 < Th3_l5D> I did it by checking logs in real time, but I also saw this script https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=7737
16:51 < Th3_l5D> but it doesn't seems to work with 0.7.5 version (or maybe I'm just lame ^^'), so do you know if there is a way to make it functionnal?
17:27 < Dune>  Hi Th3_l5D 
17:27 < Th3_l5D> hello Dune :)
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> create a status.tw user account
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> add your server there
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> have some statistics
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's the easy way
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you need to verify your server by adding some characters in fron of its name
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> after the verification process you can remove the verification string
17:31 < Dune> Th3_l5D: the structure of packets changed in 0.7
17:31 < Dune> so this script will not work in 0.7.x, and needs to be adapted
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> python api might help as a new version, but sadly it's not php
17:32 < Th3_l5D> Dune, that was my thought
17:33 < Th3_l5D> jxsl13, I'm clearly OK with python :)
17:33 < Th3_l5D> where can 9 find info about the python API ?
17:34 < Th3_l5D> -9+I
17:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think the status.tw should expose an api for 0.7 and 0.6
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I cannot find it, tho, currently
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the python api is in the teeworlds repository
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I did make a galang version for such purposes as well ;D
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> python_api.py or something like that
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Go! Version!
17:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/twapi
17:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/scripts/tw_api.py
17:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://status.tw/api/docs/#intro
17:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there it was
17:43 < Th3_l5D> I will check that, thanks :)
19:38 < the_lsd> OK, i got it working, thanks jxsl13
19:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :o?
19:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what did you use ðŸ˜„
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is it just me or are server demos completely broken?
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> what do you mean
20:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> they work for me
20:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> 0.7.5
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I got some weird 10kb files that are broken
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> demo files
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 10-80kb
21:08 < ChillerDragon> did they ever work? I thought server side demos was always something kinda broken
21:08 < ChillerDragon> Btw am I the only one who gets fps spikes when pressing a key even if its unbound https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1588532709.png
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yes (?)
22:25 < the_lsd> sorry, I just saw your message jxsl13
22:26 < the_lsd> I modified a bit the tw_api.py script
22:26 < the_lsd> I deleted the part for master servers and it worked fine
