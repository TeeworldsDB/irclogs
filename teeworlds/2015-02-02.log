05:25 < JulianAssange> breaking nes: teeworlds needs more updates
05:26 < JulianAssange> news*..
06:39 < JulianAssange> who wants to check my logic : http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=cxnc1a0N
06:39 < JulianAssange> is this right?
06:40 < JulianAssange> strlen does not count the nul terminator, which is why i have the = there, not just >
09:58 < EastByte> JulianAssange: the null terminator is part of the buffer but not of the actual string
09:59 < EastByte> if PATH_MAX is limits a buffer then your code is right
09:59 < EastByte> e.g. trying to copy location into a buffer of length PATH_MAX
10:04 < JulianAssange> it uses snprintf(null, 0) +1 to create the buffer
10:04 < JulianAssange> so in reality it doesn't matter
10:04 < JulianAssange> I just don't want to proceed with the function if it's not going to work ebcause the path is too big
10:06 < EastByte> snprintf(null, 0) +1 <- what is this for?
10:06 < EastByte> int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...);
10:08 < JulianAssange> size_t buffersize = vsnprintf(NULL, 0, str, args);
10:08 < JulianAssange> then buffersize++; , then to char *whatever = malloc(buffersize);
10:09 < EastByte> okay I get it
10:09 < JulianAssange> http://pastebin.com/8NVKUMTS that's the full function
18:14 < BotoX> does anyone have the latest nodes (1.0.4?) source code?
18:14 < BotoX> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=7477&p=7 links are broken sadly
18:16 < EastByte> iirc nodes development was kind of untransparent
18:21 < BotoX> Wanted to play it with a few friends
19:06 < BotoX> http://teeworlds.sushitee.de/nodes/
19:06 < BotoX> pls play nodes with me
19:06 < BotoX> nodes server 1 aka. tatara.botox.bz
20:40 < jxsl13> are there any popular mods for hosting :?
