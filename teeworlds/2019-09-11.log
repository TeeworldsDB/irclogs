14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Hmm how do these datasrc thingys work? Should i have access to images from code by just putting them into datasrc/editor/foo.png for example?

14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I have no clue how to add new textures in client_data.h
14:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> check out `datasrc/content.py`
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> huh i have to manually add sprites and images?
14:27 <@Dune> in datasrc/content.py, you have to link files to a string for indexing, yes
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i guess for sprites it makes sense to do it manually but why is the code even generated and handled by cmake and multiple python scripts if in the end i just hardcode image names?
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I mean the system looks pretty complex to me so i expect some convience after its understood. What is the value of it?
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't know if there's value in it
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> probably only matricks can tell you that(?)
14:33 <@Dune> makes sense to unify that with sprites?
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well anyways it worked thanks @heinrich5991
