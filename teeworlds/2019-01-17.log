15:00 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 17628ee oy: check if a map uses bezier curved envelopes on saving. otherwise store old, smaller envelope points
15:05 <@Dune> all envelopes must have the same version? :o
15:08 < Oy> yeah, otherwise the loading breaks :(
15:08 <@Dune> ouch, that's a bug I assume
15:09 < Oy> could fix that, but current clients would fail for it
15:09 <@Dune> I see :/  that is unfortunate
15:09 <@Dune> I remember my first experience with 0.7: "oh a start menu, cool" > click play > Esc > click editor > Esc > "oh shit the menus disappeared how do I get out of here"
15:09 <@Dune> Maybe Esc in the editor could do something else than remove the menus =D
15:09 < Oy> :P
15:09 < Oy> like what?
15:10 <@Dune> leave the editor?
15:10 <@Dune> maybe that would be annoying if you type <Esc> once too much
15:10 < Oy> yeah
15:11 < Oy> pressing esc in the editor does nothing for me
15:11 <@Dune> huh
15:11 <@Dune> but imo there's gotta be a "I'm not a nerd and don't know about Ctrl+shift+E, get me outta here" 
15:12 < Oy> you can go file->exit
15:12 <@Dune> ah, it's Tab that hides the menu
15:12 < Oy> yeah
15:12 <@Dune> that's how I got trapped :D
15:12 < Oy> :P
15:12 < Oy> maybe file could get a better name
15:13 <@Dune> or Double Esc could leave the editor
15:13 <@Dune> or there could be a X button
15:13 <@Dune> idk
15:28 <@Dune> Oy: https://i.imgur.com/k0W6Dm2.png
15:38 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr opened pull request #1982: Mercifully add an exit button to the editor (master...editor-add-exit) https://git.io/fh85E
15:49 < Oy> Dune: maybe skip the round corners on top too?
15:50 <@Dune> https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/355114/51326507-92e9d200-1a6f-11e9-804b-452f6581540b.png
15:50 <@Dune> better?
15:51 < Oy> yeah
15:51 <@Dune> hm, I did a `#include <game/client/components/menus.h>`, there might be a better way
15:52 < Oy> oh, you shouldn't use components from the menus in the editor
15:52 < Oy> the editor is pretty seperate right now
15:52 <@Dune> ah, I'll go with `DoButton_Editor_Common` 
15:53 < Oy> yeah, editor has duplicate stuff
15:54 < Oy> until LordSK fises it :D
15:54 < Oy> *fixes
16:04 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/nZyeCt2.png
16:04 <@Dune> for some reason it doesn't look X symmetrical
16:33 < Learath2> looks a little too high
16:35 <@Dune> I just used `DoButton_Editor` tho
16:41 < Oy> should be good for now >(
16:41 < Oy> :)

17:10 < Yasusi> Can someone send me E-Book for learning C++? And lua also,It would be good if its free,i want to learn the basics
17:12 <@Dune> If this is for Teeworlds, you don't really need Lua :)
17:12 <@heinrich5991> perhaps this helps? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list
17:14 < Yasusi> to Dune, i wanna make a client like ATH,and also some edit beside the client,so I will have to start with the very beggining :C
17:16 <@Dune> Yasusi: you don't really need any Lua to make a modified client
17:16 <@Dune> rip
17:17 < Oy> that's a good list
17:17 < Oy> "write great code" series by hyde, not in that list, still a good read

17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> @Yasusi Just know that learning programming with C++ will be a pain in the ***.
17:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> But if you are somewhat familiar with programming, Scott Meyers "Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways ..." is definitely worth a read (but not free).

17:28 <@Dune> dammit!
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> 10 minutes late from work. I really hurried up. Grr!
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Really good book, though.

17:57 <@Dune> not sure what to do with that scrollbar
17:57 < Oy> keep it the way it's right now?
18:00 < Oy> day: could you open the console(F1) and then check if you can move the mouse there?
18:00 < Oy> when the mouse is stuck top left corner
18:02 <@Dune> huh, I guess it always was like @Sonix suggested. Just looks strange to me
18:02 <@Dune> player count: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/355114/51335165-ad2cab80-1a81-11e9-869f-c5825790d629.png
18:03 <@Dune> doesn't work imo. I wish there was a visual cue to spot non-empty servers more easily :(
18:03 < Oy> but it's not like on the image u posted right now
18:03 <@Dune> it's not?
18:03 < Oy> no bottom
18:03 < Oy> ends with the list
18:03 <@Dune> aaah
18:03 < Oy> not bottom box with the search fields
18:03 <@Dune> that's why it looked strange
18:05 < Oy> too many zeros in that picture. probably better to have just one zero and just space for the other one to keep the alignment
18:06 <@Dune> what about the right number?
18:07 < Oy> same?
18:07 <@Dune> " 2/ 8"? " 2/08"? 
18:07 <@Dune> only spaces then
18:07 <@Dune> or " 2/8 "?
18:07 < Oy> hm
18:07 < Oy> some image to check would be good :)
18:08 < Oy> but " 2/8 " might be best?
18:08 <@Dune> maybe
18:09 <@Dune> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/a816d7d5ce31b4ad9285f0db942998d5/image.png
18:09 <@Dune> it's not fixed width :/  
18:09 <@Dune> need to hack something with the width of 0
18:10 <@Dune> ah, that won't work
18:12 < Oy> some graphical indicator for empty servers might be a good idea
18:13 < Oy> maybe less alpha just for player column?
18:14 <@Dune> I made some attempts with https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/355114/48855719-eebc1580-edb4-11e8-87fb-8e687eb11086.png a while ago 
18:16 <@Dune> has a few inconvenients
18:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Way too many colors ðŸ˜®
18:17 <@Dune> yeah I am no @Zatline, the yellow is horrible :D
18:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Some more space left and right of the slash could increase the readability
18:17 <@Dune> Another idea: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/355114/51336164-288f5c80-1a84-11e9-97b7-1202ab5182a1.png
18:18 <@Dune> (replace with decent colors)
18:18 <@Dune> (or grayscale)
18:18 <@Dune> but that's a bit offtopic
18:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Does the number of specs matter when searching for a server?
18:19 <@Dune> not so much I guess :)  it matters whether there is a player slot and whether there is a spec slot
18:20 < Oy> yeah, wouldn't go with colours
18:26 < day> Oy: no, I can't move it there either.
18:29 < Oy> ok
18:45 < TeeSlayer> tfw my teeworlds servers are super popular :3
18:46 < TeeSlayer> if anybody else would host classic ddrace maps it would probably change though
18:49 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/ZYXOhCL.png
18:49 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/YQvjHAA.png
18:49 <@Dune> not so easy to make a visual cue :)
18:49 <@Dune> I'll give up for now
18:54 < Oy> ok. yeah hard :)
18:55 < Oy> Dune: do u already have sth to align the player column?
18:56 <@Dune> huh, not sure what you mean
18:56 <@Dune> I can left align/right align
18:56 <@Dune> but aligning the / is hard
18:57 < Oy> yeah aligning the /
18:57 < Oy> i'll code sth for u :)
18:59 <@Dune> I'm trying something
18:59 <@Dune> (probably different)
19:02 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/a5MljMD.png
19:03 < Oy> http://www.solidfiles.com/v/yRBq3KAjDkw2n
19:03 <@Dune> looking clean :)
19:03 < TeeSlayer> Dune: that looks better tbh
19:03 < Oy> what are the empty entries?
19:05 < Oy> https://pastebin.com/LzJpJVwD
19:06 <@Dune> empty servers, haven't done them yet
19:06 < Oy> ok
19:06 <@Dune> mm, nice
19:09 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/JLV4Bho.png
19:09 <@Dune> arr, still doesn't look good
19:10 < TeeSlayer> why are logs deleted after every restart?
19:10 < TeeSlayer> is there a setting to change that?
19:10 < day> the main menu is kind of awkward to use as well
19:13 <@Dune> main?
19:13 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/2wGeiNy.png
19:13 <@Dune> can't make boxes look good :c
19:13 < Oy> TeeSlayer: no, it always uses the filename set by logfile
19:14 <@Dune> back to Oy's solution - might want to have less space around the / tho
19:14 < day> Dune: as in the menu that you see when you start the game.
19:14 <@Dune> I think it looks good
19:14 < TeeSlayer> Oy: weird. it always deletes them after a restart.
19:14 < day> it looks good. it's just, useless?
19:14 < TeeSlayer> I don't mean restart as in rcon command
19:14 <@Dune> then you can skip it if you like
19:14 < TeeSlayer> full restart
19:14 < day> oh?
19:14 < day> thats an option?
19:15 < day> nvm :^)
19:15 < Oy> TeeSlayer: yeah
19:15 < day> totally did not expect there would be an option to skip a main menu, thats a first :D
19:15 <@Dune> day: it lets you go to Editor/Demos 
19:15 < day> yeah, getting easier to the editor definitely is nice
19:15 <@Dune> I think @LordSk would agree with you :D
19:16 < Oy> TeeSlayer: it recreates the logfile when you start the application. old content is gone then
19:16 < day> on which part?
19:16 < TeeSlayer> Oy: yeah that's my problem. I don't want that
19:17 < TeeSlayer> currently I'm archiving the logs with a cronjob, but that's not a solution
19:17 < Oy> yeah. sth could done about it
19:18 <@Dune> btw if(Num < 100)   Button.x += RenderOffset;
19:18 <@Dune> is that necessary, Oy?
19:19 < Oy> i think the browser can show >64 player servers
19:21 <@Dune> ok
19:25 <@Dune> like that, Oy? https://i.imgur.com/kf8Wkob.png
19:25 <@Dune> cues that would be nice to have: (1) server is full (2) server is empty (3) player slots are full
19:26 <@Dune> right now, there is (1). this would add (2)
19:29 <@Dune> maybe this for (3)? https://i.imgur.com/6qJY2q5.png
19:29 <@Dune> or a better gfx (hello @Zatline =D)
19:31 < Oy> (2) looks good
19:32 < Oy> (3) bit odd - and might overlap for 64/64?
19:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> where is the issue?
19:35 < day> jusqt noticed the ctf5 map change. now i cant grief anymore :<
19:36 <@Dune> on the bottom of the map, you mean?
19:36 < day> yeah
19:36 <@Dune> @Zatline we are trying to make the server browser player count column look good
19:36 < day> i still dont get why its the #1 pub map. it doesnt work at all for pub games
19:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> it already looks good?
19:37 <@Dune> day: it's big and it's fun, there is a fight area in the middle, there are unhookable, pits, etc
19:37 <@Dune> correct, let me refine my thought
19:37 < day> it's just too big for uncoordinated play imho
19:38 <@Dune> I'd like to make it convey more information, such as: player slots full @zatline
19:38 < day> not your problem. i jsut dont get why server admins pick this map
19:38 <@Dune> it's not the server admins, day, it's the players. When I get a pub game started on any other map they try to vote ctf5
19:39 < day> maybe it's because they die less, due to the size. idk
19:39 <@Dune> so maybe there could be some sort of icon next to the XX/XX ? if you have any idea
19:40 <@Dune> (see previous screenshot)

19:40 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master ae343e3 oy: added a config to add a timestamp to the logfile and added an extension to the log filename
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> hmm don't really see waht's wrong with it Dune, it's generic in a good way it works fine
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> doesn't it?
19:41 < Oy> TeeSlayer: grab that commit ^ and set logfile_timestamp to 1
19:41 <@Dune> yes, but it doesn't convey all information it could
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> which may be a good thing, too many info is not good either
19:43 <@Dune> that is a good point
19:43 < TeeSlayer> Oy: thanks, I'll do. to apply that I need empty servers first ^^
19:43 <@Dune> if it cannot be done simply enough and elegantly enough, it probably shouldn't be done
19:44 <@Dune> I find it, however, frustrating to jump on servers and find that there is no player slots - so I would have to switch the "count players only" filter all the time
19:46 < Oy> Dune: agree
19:47 <@Dune> Opened https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1984
19:48 < rand> otherwise, you can use tee for teeworlds_srv
19:48 < Oy> good to seperate it from the pr
19:48 < rand> teeworlds_srv -f conf.cfg | tee -a log

23:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hey, does anyone know why the masterservers 1-3 are down?
23:12 < Oy> they are?
23:13 <@Dune> for 0.6, seemingly
23:13 < Oy> that's good i think
23:14 < Oy> they're unfixable for 0.6, so better keep them down
23:14 <@Dune> the 0.7 happened for a reason, yeah
23:20 <@Dune> it may be a bit early for that, it's been a bit over a month
23:24 < Oy> well from the perspective of the hoster of the masters it's understandable. you don't want to provide a dos service

23:27 <@Dune> hm
23:28 <@Dune> I experienced this too
23:28 <@Dune> for example, if this IRC was Teeworlds and I autocompleted O, I might get someone else than you - not starting with O
23:28 <@Dune> mostly happens when the server is crowded afaik, clear bug
23:29 < Oy> ok. so it doesn't start with names that start with the letter u type?
23:29 <@Dune> yes
23:29 < Oy> k
23:33 <@Dune> difficult to reproduce :/
23:35 <@Dune> > crash twice doing the same thing

23:40 < Oy> to make it crash?
23:40 <@Dune> loading a map - but I'm not on master
23:40 < Oy> oh ok
23:41 <@Dune> I don't know how to deploy any windows debugging tool that can be invoked after the crash :/
23:42 <@Dune> good job for the autocompletion fix, that's an impressive one without being able to reproduce :D
23:43 < Oy> do u have ms vs installed?
23:43 <@Dune> it's in a zombie state
23:43 <@Dune> do u know how to make the "debug" prompt work?
23:44 <@Dune> I used to have it on vista
23:47 < Oy> build debug tw version with cl compiler. open ms vs. then File->Open->Project/Solution. then find the the executable. then start the executable from ms vs(green start button on top)
23:48 <@Dune> yeah, but you need to know you're going to crash - or always play like this
23:49 <@Dune> I used to have this https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5825647d-bb50-4091-8c01-cf2e23f3383a?upload=true
23:49 <@Dune> third option says "Debug the program"
23:50 < Oy> doesn't it automatically start ms vs then?
23:50 <@Dune> it does
23:50 <@Dune> did I misunderstand?
23:50 <@Dune> can you load the program in vs after it crashed using your instructions?
23:51 < Oy> you could tr debug->attach to process
23:51 < Oy> *try
23:52 <@Dune> oh, ok
