15:34 < necropotame> Some people complained about TeeUniverse making antivirus too excited (Windows). Did you (TW devs) do something special for TeeWorlds to avoid this, or I've introduced something in a bad way? I've absolutely no knowledge about all this stuff :/
15:41 < EastByte> What compiler do you use for the windows binaries?
15:44 < necropotame> MinGW
15:45 < necropotame> 32bit
15:47 < necropotame> But I guess I should answer for each DLL, and I don't know this point (but they all comes from trusted websites)
15:48 < EastByte> "answer for each DLL"? Well, MinGW certainly does raise some AV issues but it's used for ddnet aswell (iirc)
15:52 < necropotame> DDNet use MinGW from Linux (sjlj) while I'm sadly using MinGW from Windows (dw2)
15:55 < Socialdarwinist> Antivirusses are malware too. It does roughly the same. It hampers normal program functioning. One can’t do anything sure for the people if their system is irrationally configured.
15:56 < EastByte> and it raises additional security issues
15:58 < EastByte> necropotame: well if you are on windows you can always switch to VS
16:17 < Socialdarwinist> Yep, he can, but the question is what would make the difference. I presume that one has it hard to know it and has to try out for closed-source systems, because it is a secret of antivirus vendors how they discriminate programs – and cannot be sure if one is doing right, because one gets lost in the black hole of irrationalism comprised by various layers of closed-source.
16:55 < necropotame> EastByte, I could give it a try, but it means that I will definitely stop with the dream of compile it from Windows :( But I've partly got my answer: there is nothing in particular to do :/
16:55 < necropotame> From Linux*
16:57 < EastByte> btw. have you tested the executable on virustotal? There may be some hints
16:59 < necropotame> Never heard about this. What is it?
17:00 < EastByte> https://virustotal.com/
17:00 < EastByte> it's a simple AV scanning site
17:00 < necropotame> Ok
17:00 < necropotame> Thanks for the name, I will test that when I can
17:04 < EastByte> there is no false positive for teeuniverse_editor.exe atleast
17:08 < necropotame> I'm sure it's again a problem with libicu.dll :D this library is a hell
17:10 < necropotame> (I'm assuming that DLLs are checked by the AV too, but maybe I'm wrong :/)
17:11 < EastByte> AVs usually do not leave a single file out
17:11 < EastByte> but I see no detections at all
17:24 < laxa> Socialdarwinist: it's not really a secret how antivirus are working
17:54 < necropotame> OK. Since it's not blocking, I will keep it as it is for now
