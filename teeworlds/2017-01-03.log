14:21 <+necropotame> I've setup a server to show animated death tiles/entities in action, if you are interested (the map is just a show room): 137.74.156.196:10005
14:21 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: what do I need to join?
14:27 < EastByte> ^ the given address :p
15:12 < quatria> its really cool, and you can join with the normal client
22:09 < xandaros> That's actually pretty neat
22:12 <+necropotame> Technically, this allows to create giant bosses. The only problem is that it's hard to do animations in the vanilla editor
22:14 <+necropotame> Like, a flying dragon in the map that will kill you if you touch it. Players must avoid him and try to kill others players in the same time. It's just an illustration :)
