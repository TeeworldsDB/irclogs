11:25 < Bzhu> Hi. Any thoughts on closed-source clients? I just found out that one of my admins uses such a client. I’m a little concerned that the client might leak my rcon password to its creator. I’m also concerned that my admin might be using cheat features of this client.
11:27 < minus> closed source forks are lame, but you can't do anything about it because teeworlds isn't GPL or similar
12:06 < Bzhu> I guess if I were really suspicious I could run this client in a wiresharked environment and look what happens…
12:07 < Bzhu> But I probably won’t (too much effort for a mild concern)
12:09 < rand> why do you need to run an untrusted client ?
12:09 <@Dune> it's always a security concern to run a client that you haven't built yourself
12:10 <@Dune> I don't think an rcon password leak would be *that* bad. You can see who auths on your console and I don't think there are too many exploits you can do from the rcon
12:16 < Bzhu> OK
14:10 < Bzhu> .ls
14:10 < Bzhu> .ls
14:10 < Bzhu> sorry, wrong channel
14:12 < Bzhu> Anyway thanks for the advice. I’ll just advise my admin not to run this client and explain to him why. He’s 12 but he’s smart, he may understand.
14:12 <@heinrich5991> Bzhu: which client is it?
14:12 < Bzhu> baumelein
14:12 < Bzhu> baumalein*
14:12 <@heinrich5991> pure cheat client ^^
14:12 < Bzhu> I saw that on the webpage, yes
14:12 <@heinrich5991> but I'm not aware of any password leaking mechanic
14:13 < Bzhu> I was wondering why he would use it instead of ddnet if not for cheating
14:14 < Bzhu> But maybe he only finds it cool to use something different, I don’t want to accuse him of anything.
14:14 < Bzhu> False positives can lead to conflict too (I know it too well)
14:20 < Bzhu> Anyway, I’ll have to go, but I would have liked to chat a little about a problem I have with the DDNet client: as it stands, I can’t really use it because of keyboard layout / key handling issues
14:21 < Bzhu> But as I said, I have to go, so I’ll come back some time later. See you.
14:22 <@heinrich5991> see you
14:22 <@heinrich5991> ddnet stuff is better discussed in #ddnet ^^
14:22 < Bzhu> OK :-)
21:00  * day demands the integration of an apm indicator
21:06 <@Dune> I think I already ported it to 0.7 but it's frankly not very useful
21:06 < day> Dune: an apm counter?
21:07 <@Dune> I'm porting teecomp, which has it
21:07 < day> wasnt sure if you maybe meant ddnet. in both cases the statement would be true :P
21:07 <@Dune> ddnet took all of teecomp, so anything teecomp has, ddnet should have it
21:07 < day> would be funny to see peoples apm in the scoreboard
21:08 <@Dune> ah, that. well apm is so meaningless in a fps like that :/
21:09 < day> it's rather meaningless in general imho. it's simply dick wanking
21:09 <@Dune> depends on the game
21:09 < day> just look at the brainless spamming in starcraft :P
21:10 <@Dune> you can't keep it up for very long
21:10 < day> challenge accepted
21:10 <@Dune> and low apm is always meaningful ^^
21:11 < day> a mate got to master or so with sub 100apm iirc :P
21:11 <@heinrich5991> the AIs use apm as a limiter
21:11 <@Dune> I don't doubt you can do that, Stephanator did too
21:11 <@heinrich5991> a friend of mine plays starcraft with touchpad in diamond :)
21:11 < day> haha
21:12 <@Dune> it definitely reflects in what you can play or can't though ^^
21:13 < day> i think my fav so far is league of legendw with a racing wheel
21:13 <@heinrich5991> wat
21:13 < day> https://youtu.be/66raQRIi4LQ?t=562 wait till he pushs the NOS button xD
21:14 < day> maybe i  give teecomp a try
21:27 <@Dune> teecomp is a 0.5 mod, day
21:27 <@Dune> it's been included in any client mod in existence
21:27 <@Dune> it was made for that
21:28 < day> i see. which modded client do you recommend?
21:28 <@Dune> the statboard, the customisation for tees, lasers, etc, that comes from there
21:28 <@Dune> for 0.7, I only know mine
21:28 < day> didnt know you still have one
21:28 < day> the cheat client that lets you disable textures? :P
21:28  * day restarts a 4year old argument
21:29 < day> or 8? :P
21:29 <@Dune> probably 8
21:29 <@Dune> and yeah, that one
21:29 <@Dune> it lets you automap maps differently, you can player on winter ctf4 :)
21:31 <@Dune> I'll release teecomp separately anyway for those allergic to my products :D
21:53 < rand> favorites are not shown in the default filter "teeworlds", is it a feature ?
21:54 < day> rand: are you rand() ingame?
21:54 < rand> hm, not sure in fact
21:54 < rand> I am
21:54 < day> <3
21:54 < day> i occasionally see you on ctf5
21:54 <@Dune> rand, they should not be included if they're not pure gametype?
21:55 <@Dune> having rand on the server makes it easy to win
21:55 <@Dune> just pick the same team
21:55 < rand> lol
21:55 < day> dunno the only monster ive seen so far is mario bros
21:55 < day> aka qi//magnet :P
21:55 < rand> Dune: it's a bet I'd rather not take
21:56 < rand> aaaaaaaaaaaaah
21:56 < rand> mario bros is magnet disguised
21:56 < day> pssh
21:56 < day> i legitly lost 2v1 against him. and we were both capable T_T
21:57 < rand> hm, who are you ingame ?
21:57 < day> machine
21:57 < rand> o/
22:01 < rand> Dune: in fact, my server is filtered, w/o favorite, sharing the same ip as a modded server, that's my starting hypothesis, let's dig it
22:02 < rand> already invalidate…
22:03 < rand> erk, maybe… 
22:11 < rand> the map name
22:13 < day> Dune: the pistol reloading is that purely server sided? i.e. could one host a server on which the pistol always reloads no matter if it's pulled out or not?
22:15 < rand> it is server side, so it is possible, but it should be annouced as a modded server
22:39 <@Dune> yeah
22:40 <@Dune> rand, you have tried to take down the modded server? when you mean your server, is it a local server, on the 127.0.0.1 network?
23:32 < rand> Dune: i found the issue, default filter is filtering pure map, and I didn't update that part, I was still using sur1
23:34 <@Dune> ahh I see
23:51 <@Dune> rand, https://i.imgur.com/bt82Kf2.png
23:51 <@Dune> the lack of scrollbar looks like a bug?
