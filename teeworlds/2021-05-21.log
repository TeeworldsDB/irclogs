01:03 < minus> personally, i still have slack in my irc client via wee-slack. not that i'd use slack for anything other than work (attempt to convert work to irc was poor and failed).

15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> who needs pretty ui anyhow? At least Teeworlds Ui doesn't look like windows95
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> Hey hey it is not as bad as you think
16:23 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> minus i also run irc on my vps and it has history as long as my vps does not crash :D but i have no proper way to sync it to my mobile phone. The element app is just easy to use. Tbh those were some random pain points xd maybe i just used the wrong irc client.
16:43 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> chillerdragon, IRCv3 has a feature for syncing history between servers and clients
16:43 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> however, it's not especially well supported
16:44 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> ZNC supports it though
