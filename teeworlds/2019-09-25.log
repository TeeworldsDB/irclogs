10:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> steam wants us to "notarize" our macOS application
11:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Sounds expensive?
12:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Looks time consuming. Creating a developer account and compiling with Xcode yikes.
12:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Or else it wont run on 10.15?
13:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> costs $/â‚¬ 99 per year. apple sucks in that regard heavily.
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> could we get 7 people from germany to found a teeworlds foundation? something like this for kde: https://ev.kde.org/
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im german ðŸ™‚
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that would get us some legal status, and allow us to get accounts (e.g. apple) account as an organization
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but maybe we could ask other open source projects how they handle that first
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @heinrich5991 I volunteer as tribute
15:39 < Dune> Should ask if minus knows about that
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yup
15:40 < minus> hm?
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> do you know how other open source organizations handle not being a legal entity?
15:40 < minus> no clue
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> o/ would not mind ðŸ˜„
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> why are you/we not a legal entity? Lawyer required here
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> gesellschaft bÃ¼rgerlichen rechts bgb
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> in germany there is something like a "Mini-Gmbh"
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> tw is non profit
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it would probably be a e.V. if anything
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> then its a gGmbH
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the g is for "gemeinnÃ¼tzig"
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think we should first check what other open source projects do
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> instead of ev check out my bgb part
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but ev isnt bad either
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as it's official and stuff
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you are right, e.V. is the way to go
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> GbR might work as well, but yeah
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> an e.V. needs at least 3 people
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> not 7?
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> 7
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> for founding
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ah, 3 before cancelling
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so 3 permanent and 4 temporary germans are needed
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> o/
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you could actually combine that and make a teeworlds esports e.V.
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and organize some "kind of events"
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Probably not the same thing
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I see some problems, once a year you have to vote leaders and a "treasurer" who has to write a thing to the finanzamt
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> finanzamt = "german tax authorities"
16:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://www.vereinswelt.de/verein-steuererklaerung-abgeben
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> guess that non profit "societies" don't need to do their taxes?
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> rather association
16:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> in this case you have to write a "Gem 1" every 3 years
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah, that's better than either every month/every 3 months a USt-ErklÃ¤rung, once a year a KÃ¶rtperschaftsSt-ErklÃ¤rung etc etc ðŸ˜„
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> KÃ¶rper*
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> thats true, i guess using an e.V. in generall is a bad idea, since it's overhead
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, sometimes needed :'/
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Meh if sdl fails to init it messes up graphics and doesn't change them back :c
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Should we change that?
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon>

18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Uhm i mean here:
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/626460166879182849/unknown.png
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> So if you have a bug because monitor is plugged out or you forgot you are in a ssh session or something else you get messed up resolution on most fullhd screens it is tricky to change it back without diving into the config again.
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the github repo has no travis ci right? And also no mac build? Seems like macOS changed the graphics api in the xcode update.
