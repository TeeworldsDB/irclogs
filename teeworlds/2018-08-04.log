10:19 <@minus> oh wow, i haven't installed teeworlds on this computer i built late last year yet
10:21 <@minus> unsurprisingly it doesn't work properly on wayland
10:23 <@matricks> :D
10:25 <@minus> it renders fine with xwayland but pointer constraints aren't implemented in the compositor i'm using, so the mouse is unusable
10:25 <@minus> SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland doesn't work at all
