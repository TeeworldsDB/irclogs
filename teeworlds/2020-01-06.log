00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @redix thanks for working on this
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @heinrich5991 about using older software: there is ubuntu 16.04 but it seems like they also include cmake 3.12 there =\
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> encrypted tw chat when?
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/663737303948328970/unknown.png
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yikes did i just leaked my macaddr xd
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I wanted to write p2p encryption :p
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but I don't think many people care
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's only nice for whispers
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and for account systems
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im afraight to login into my level 31 account in hotel wifi
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> üòÑ
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> use a 5$ wrench protection to spot for teeworlds sniffers
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> whats this
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://xkcd.com/538/
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah that thing
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but how is that going to help me detect the sniffer
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> that only works after i know who is attacking me
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> can't be hard to spot someone who follows you in hotels and looks like a ddnet player :p
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> "looks like a ddnet player" lol
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> lol
14:46 < Oy> lol, how do u recognize them?
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> they're playing all the time, everywhere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqGmjIKQGPs
15:00 < Oy> ah :D
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> holy xD that's dedication
16:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> wtf
16:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @ChillerDragon you could implement an encryption into your custom client
16:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea :/
16:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/663762360279891979/image0.jpg
16:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> just use public/private key on server side
16:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> always hanging out in pub places xd
16:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> client encrypts password with public key, server decrypts and then encrypts again with salt and pepper to check (encrypted) database
16:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i sock @Assa  pls do an pr
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @ChillerDragon i tend to use external libs to not reinvent the wheel
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> like https://www.cryptopp.com/
16:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i tend to stay away from libs cuz they confuse me
16:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i rather paste stuff from stackoverflow xd
16:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you don't want to write your own asymetric encryption/decryption
16:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> believe me
16:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> system("openssl ..") xd
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> this actually could work xD
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you could add a password storage to you client, too x)
16:57 < Oy> Dune: what do u think about a dev blog post that you can get the latest dev version now?
17:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> One important rule for cryptography: don't do it yourself üòÄ
17:39 < Dune_> yea, should do that Oy
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune @redix good job with the github actions workflow, i like how you managed to use the os-matrix
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Did I do anything? :D
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> oh i mean @heinrich5991 who discussed this stuff yesterday?
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the CI workflow is now much cleaner and new mods that pop up can use it easily, too (without subscribing to 3 other services)
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah, that's neat, might fix my windows shit, or maybe not
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2082
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @redix i have some problems with your github actions pr in my repo
18:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I'm pretty sure this is caused by the freetype dll
18:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I built freetype dlls with mingw which should work without any msvc runtime
18:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> What about using these instead?
18:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well, it treats warnings as errors, how can i disable a warning for fall through in switch case? i made the fall through on purpose
18:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> some flag
18:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> -wno-error
18:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or so
18:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> can i change it in cmakelist.txt somewhere?
18:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> in the github actions
18:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> btw, doesnt teeworlds itself uses fall throughs?
18:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> is it on windows?
18:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> they treat warnings as errors in their build stuff, usually
18:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> he is just missing the 2015 redistributable package
18:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/download/details.aspx?id=48145
18:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its GitHub actions, the pr by redix
18:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The freetype stuff is in the artifacts in case someone wants to test: 
18:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/axblk/freetype2/runs/371681149
18:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `-Werror=implicit-fallthrough=cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)` is in my cmakelists.txt already?
18:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> at the top
18:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @fokkonaut the cflags and cxxflags in the build matrix... Remove -Werror
18:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> And for windows /WX
18:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> uhm wat? never done this before
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/f7b66851fe94ff06e90238d03cdc9f90a0cc7c44/.github/workflows/build.yaml#L18
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> just wanna turn off fallthrough warning for github actions
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what does that line do?
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Warnings ad errors
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> But compiler errors... Didn't read all your messages. Sorry üòÖ
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea well thats a good one, but wanna disable fall through warning^^
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm doing the full course of irresponsibility `cmake -Wno-error=dev -DDEV=ON `
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._.
18:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> When you remove -Werror=dev from the workflow the warning will not be treated as an error anymore
18:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Okay ignore this...
18:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> `-Wimplicit-fallthrough=0`
18:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> or use `-w` to disable all warning messages
18:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> üëç
18:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> added fall through comments, but thatks :)
18:25 < Oy> redix that sounds good :)
18:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @oy, any plans for a next release already?
18:31 < Oy> no
18:31 < Oy> just had a release :P
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> speed conserving stairs when? üòõ
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I just wish i wasn't sick and have time and motivation for teeworlds development ._.
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> drugs usually help in this situation @Assa
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> which one does help you?
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> uff, assa and drugs
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> milk with honey
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> did 0.7.4 delete lts?
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> nevermind I did
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Depends on your body and the type of sickness I guess
19:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> windows sucks
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> git didn't do a merge conflict in my bam.lua
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> it just overwrote it <.<
19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> wtf, i just pulled and merged from the master
19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i got a note that chillerdragon referenced one of my issues
19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/AssassinTee/catch64/issues/3
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> did you know that references could break like this?
19:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yes @Assa
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Multiple forks is known GitHub Limitation
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @redix do you have a working solutions to pack and upload with gh-actions?
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> They share issues and prs and that‚Äôs why you can only fork one version
19:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The workflow in the repo should do that @ùìîùìºùìºùì≤ùì∞ùì™ùìæùìΩùì∏ùì∂ùì™ùìΩ
19:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> It calls the package_default target from cmake
19:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> And then uploads the file as artifact
19:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> btw... Anyone knows why the packages are created manually instead of really using cpack? üòÖ
19:46 < rand> what is cpack ?
19:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> how does it work? every time i push to the master?
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Everytime you push to any branch. You can however limit it to the master branch
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe i missunderstand it, it doesn't create releases for me automatically, does it?
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/AssassinTee/catch64/releases
19:47 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> I need to start grokking this code :(
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> It's not doing a release. It's just uploading them as artifacts for the build
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> thank you, this helps ‚ù§Ô∏è
19:48 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> I has ideas for fun stuff, just played a zombie map or two, want to try making it a dark map so you have lights on the guns
19:48 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> basically just mask everything out and show what's in the beam
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> You could also use it for a release
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i see i can download it from the download button on the workflow
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> thank you redix ‚ù§Ô∏è
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> now i have trunk builds of default teeworlds, too <333
19:51 < redix_> rand: cpack is a program that comes with cmake. You can use it for automatically packaging your software
19:52 < redix_> Actually tw uses the corresponding variables in cmake but the packages are created by custom commands and python scripts instead of really using the cpack generator
19:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> JewZeus: you cant really do that atm
19:55 < redix_> It's not really a problem, I was just curious if there is a reason for this. Maybe cpack is missing some functionality
19:58 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> dune, the idea is to figure out how to add that functionality
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @redix my github actions fails on "Prepare Linux". I guess its because I use ddnet-libs and not the normal teeworlds libs
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> any idea how to fix it?
21:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> look at the error logs?
21:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> prepare linux just installs packets with apt... no clue what could go wrong there
21:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> guess i have it
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nah
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ```E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ##[error]Process completed with exit code 100.```
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> apt-get update then
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> how? this is inside of github actions
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> im new to this
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ah
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i write in in front of the rest
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no wait its in therer already
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well, redix has it in there but with sudo
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `E: Failed to fetch http://azure.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/c/cmake/cmake-data_3.5.1-1ubuntu3_all.deb  503  Service Unavailable`
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> `sudo apt install sudo`
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what c++ version do you use?
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its just a mod of tw, latest
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> latest tw
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I got cmake directly from kitware
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and i just wanna run this github actions test xd
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i am using redix pr
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but my windows build says no, so no tw github actions for me
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it will be automatically enabled once you habe that .github/workflow folder. might be overwhelmed by the activity right now, so tue azure service has died
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but teeworlds master builds too
21:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/zcatch/blob/cb1cc25f6f70b904cb77bd7e4ed0284c4c76711a/.github/workflows/build.yaml#L53
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> tw master has finished building yesterday
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, 10 hours ago
21:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might as well wait a while and somehow trigger a rebuild
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Tests seem to work now :)
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Btw, one question. I have made a function that goes through an array of chars and searches for some special symbols and based on that it puts a colorcode at the correct place. This function is called every second once per player (only if the player is on a moneytile)
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> is that a problem for the performance?
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ok cool
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I finally fixed all issues for the GitHub Actions, working now and built :)
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you could have less iterations by putting the call in some other for loop that's already iterating over the players.
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its not handled the way you think, its inside of a function that handles all the tiles
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so it checks whether i am on tile x and does stuff then
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> the DDNet HandleTiles() function, from character.cpp if you know it
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> And there i am sending a broadcast every second with the current player stats when player x sits on the moneytile.
23:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> is there an example for the chat command feature?
23:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes, thanks to @fokkonaut
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ^^
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> link? üôÇ
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> already found out i need to take a look to the gamecontroller
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/fokkonaut/teeworlds/commit/64368c53347cbd5be86484d002fb653c5c1e446a
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> use the teeworlds repo, i force pushed xd
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> thx
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> oh i just need to comment out the last lines
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> now that's fancy
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> No
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thats am example
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well, if you rename it and stuff yes
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *to get a working example
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea xD
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but it wont do anything
23:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Btw, @Ryozuki for me it is very handy that the pArgs is the whole message string
23:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> works nice
23:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> nice
23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but a thing that is not useful is the formatting
23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> with p, s, i, c
23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or whatever
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> its meant for autocompletion in the future
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> but idk
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> the client could send a packet with current args which requets autocompletion values but im 2 lazy
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> uff... well, now right now i dont send any format and manually write <username> or <password> in the description
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> well you can use it however u want :)
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Requesting auto completion would be cool tho
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can do both
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> send format and write the description
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i know
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but custom format can not be done otherwise
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well i do both, but sending both as descriptiom
23:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what's the easiest way to send the client a load of strings (that are known in compile time)
23:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i tend to fill an array and just spam SendMessage over and over
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> why would you want that
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> for example `/info` command
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ? xd
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what do you want to do
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @fokkonaut this is the time where you go on zcatch or catch64 and type `/info` in the chat
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no idea
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> just SendMessages probably
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can add a delay if you feel like it
