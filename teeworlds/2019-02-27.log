12:47 < MarisaG> Hi everyone
12:49 < MarisaG> I just put out a tool for adding votes for aall maps in your maps folder. Info:
12:49 < MarisaG> Ok, I have my add maps script ready. Here is description & link:This tool will scan your maps folder and create a config file with voting options for all the maps in your maps folder. You can use this to rebuild your config after adding maps to your server. Only tested on Linux servers. You can get it here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/teeworlds-add-maps-utility and if you have any questions just ask me!
12:49 < MarisaG> And thanks for making such a great game :)
16:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea pls heinrich5991 provide some documentation for libtw2 o.o
17:02 < day> comes right after teeworlds v1.0
17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> isnt tw v1.0 rlsd already?
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=9332
17:31 < Oy> should do another one :)
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> especially we can release 0.7.3 in time :)
17:35 < Oy> should be doable :)
17:35 <@Dune> yeah
17:36 < Oy> seems that debian issues is resolved
17:37 <@Dune> yes
17:38 <@Dune> I contacted the verdre guy too about gfx_use_x11xrandr_wm
17:38 <@Dune> so debian & gnome are satisfied :)
17:39 < Oy> great, that's good :)
17:39 < Oy> then there's 0.7.3 next :)
17:39 <@Dune> yep :)
17:40 <@Dune> with the open PRs, I did all I can for 0.7.3 though, saved for #1827 that still needs discussion
17:41 <@Dune> well I can do april fools decorations with eggs doodads automapped everywhere :D
17:42 < Oy> the composed bind thing? - not sure which might be the best solution
17:42 <@Dune> yes
17:42 < Oy> yeah, doodads decoration sounds good :)
17:42 <@Dune> I had the pleasure to witness someone pull his hair on that code on livestream yesterday :D
17:43 < Oy> which code?
17:43 <@Dune> modifiers
17:43 < Oy> oh :)
17:43 <@Dune> hungarian notation gets funny with the 3D array
17:46 <@Dune> the april eggs doodads could be added using the built-in automapper but the code to do that is a bit heavy :|
17:48 < Oy> oh, ok
17:50 <@Dune> automapping doodads on ctf3 client-side: https://i.imgur.com/gyD4258.png :)
17:51 <@Dune> but if there is only one rule, I guess it can be hardcoded so it can save the automapper use
17:51 < Oy> yeah :)
17:55 <@Dune> still needs some tileset :/  we lack an artist
17:56 < Oy> yeah :(
17:56 < Oy> also could really need the bot graphics
17:56 <@Dune> yeah right :/
17:57  * Dune summons @Zatline
17:57 <@Dune> my mana is low
17:57 < Oy> :D
17:58 < Oy> maybe we should do a post in the "Developer Journals" so people can make suggestions, images for a bot flag+skin
17:59 <@Dune> at least the flag, yeah
18:00 <@Dune> I think there are some specific instructions to draw them though
18:02 <@Dune> right, https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=8084
18:02 < Oy> hm, there was some thread by Landil where people could send in all the flags
18:02 <@Dune> yes, that one
18:02 < Oy> yeah, that one :)
18:02  * Dune whistles
18:03 <@Dune> but there was a step that only Landil would do
18:03 < rand> I might have another issue
18:03 <@Dune> I think @Zatline might know it too
18:04 < Oy> think Landil added the shadow afterwards, but we can do it. saw the shadow somewhere in the dropbox account
18:05 <@Dune> oh, nice
18:06 < rand> hm, code says there is not issue
18:06 < Oy> rand: ?
18:06 <@Dune> I have another pending blog post on translations, since we are nearing release and heinrich5991 recently upgraded the system with the %$1d feature
18:06 < rand> sorry, I m talking to myself ^^'
18:08 < rand> hmâ€¦ playerstats are not reset on teeworlds/master when leaving/join
18:09 < Oy> Dune: good :)
18:09 < Oy> rand: when u leave urself?
18:10 <@Dune> huh, when you leave and join again everyone should be at 0/0, right?
18:10 < rand> the other player left, another took the same slot
18:10 <@Dune> and he inherited the score of the old player?
18:11 < rand> yep, because of m_pClient->m_aClients[pMsg->m_ClientID].m_Active is false when a client recieves NETMSGTYPE_SV_CLIENTINFO
18:14 <@Dune> ah, buuuug :)
18:14 < rand> you change NETMSGTYPE_SV_CLIENTDROP to NETMSGTYPE_SV_CLIENTINFO I guess
18:16 < rand> I'm not confident about what I stated, but it was the case on one test :p
18:20 <@Dune> there is https://github.com/flathub/com.teeworlds.Teeworlds/pull/7 lying around btw. I looked into man, and it says
18:20 <@Dune>        --device=DEVICE  Expose a device to the application. This updates the [Context] group in the metadata. DEVICE must be one of: dri, kvm, all. This option can be used           multiple times.
18:20 < rand> huhu
18:20 <@Dune> I'm not sure if that's useful given that teeworlds does not support joystick (yet)
18:31 < Oy> never tested a joystick. do buttons work?
18:31 < Oy> but there's probably no harm from enabling that setting?
18:32 <@Dune> yeah
18:34 <@Dune> besides, someone is working on it anyway: https://tsoding.github.io/schedule/ :)
18:34 <@Dune> might ask the PR's author what his intents are though
18:35 < Oy> rand: yeah drop message works. gameclient handles the messages after the components, so the client isn't dropped for the scoreboard yet
18:36 < Oy> Dune: that's good :)
18:36 < Oy> someone did gamepad support on 0.6 with the old sdl version in a client mod
18:36 < Oy> might be easier to do it with sdl2
18:37 <@Dune> not sure
18:37 <@Dune> apparently keys.h hasn't been touched for long :D
18:39 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blame/master/src/engine/keys.h
