09:28 < day> odd did someone kick me @"2019-03-03 06:02" GMT+1 ?
10:43 <@heinrich5991> 2019-03-03.log:[06:21:21] *** Quits: day (~Unknown@p508BE6E9.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout
10:43 <@heinrich5991> )
10:45 <@heinrich5991> day: on 2019-03-03, +r was temporarily set on this channel
10:45 <@heinrich5991> this means only users registered to Q could join (due to spam problems)
10:55 < day> ah
12:02 <@Dune> I downloaded gtest thanks to heinrich5991's help but still can't compile teeworlds with cmake
12:02 <@Dune> I get CMake Error (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:200 (message):  DATA does not contain every file from directory datasrc on master
12:02 <@heinrich5991> do you have an up-to-date datasrc?
12:03 <@heinrich5991> git submodule update --init
12:03 <@Dune> git status says all is according to master
12:03 <@Dune> ah
12:03 <@Dune> so you *need* up-to-date submodules to not have those warnings :|
12:04 <@heinrich5991> we could stop doing these errors, but then users will have incomplete/missing data after compilation
12:05 <@Dune> it doesn't say what files are missing :/
12:05 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't?
12:05 <@heinrich5991> should theoretically say so in the next line after the error
12:06 <@Dune> CMake Error (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:200 (message):  DATA does not contain every file from directory datasrcCall Stack (most recent call first):  CMakeLists.txt:463 (set_glob)This error is for project developers. Use -Wno-error=dev to suppress it.
12:06 <@Dune> it doesn't as far as I can see
12:06 <@heinrich5991> ok, and after that line? ^^
12:06 <@heinrich5991> could you post the log?
12:06 <@Dune> -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
12:06 <@Dune> that is all
12:06 <@heinrich5991> hmm
12:06 <@Dune> I could see the .log of course
12:07 <@heinrich5991> nah
12:07 <@Dune> I still haven't solved the mystery of https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2039 not passing
12:11 <@heinrich5991> the problem is that the alphabetical order was broken
12:11 <@heinrich5991> I guess I'll add an error message for that
12:11 <@Dune> huuuuh really...
12:11 <@Dune> that's frustrating :c
12:12 <@heinrich5991> put it after ui/no_skinpart.png
12:12 <@Dune> alright
12:14 <@Dune> or just scan the whole directory and copy everything like bam does, this way there are no cmake-specific issues
12:20 <@Dune> thanks :)
12:28 <@heinrich5991> np. cmake is kinda my fault :P
22:19 <@Dune> would be nice if someone tested the joystick support before the next release, now that it's in teeworlds :)
