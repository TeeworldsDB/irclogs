03:43 < user774> oh no all of the FNG servers are gone
03:43 < user774> oh no 
03:44 < user774> I changed default.json to something else
03:44 < user774> now this
03:44 < user774> :(
03:44 < user774> in skins
03:49 < user774> uh oh
03:52 < user774> ok deleted the stuff I installed everything is peachy, phew!
03:53 < user774> is it possible to change the default/standard skin for everyone [that doesn't have a default skin]?
03:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah, just rename that skin to default
03:54 < user774> The thing is...everyone probably has a custom skin but it defaults to a "standard-skin", which would work even if I named it.. default? in ~/.local/share/teeworlds/skins/    ?  (ie. as default.json)?
03:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah it's the one named default in your teeworlds installation
03:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> probably not over .local
03:55 < user774> well I tried it but everyone's skin looked like the default that wasn't what I replaced it with
03:56 < user774> in /usr/share/games/teeworlds/data/skins/
03:56 < user774> the skin was working in the Settings
03:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> again, no, in your teeworlds install
03:57 < user774> even my skin was replaced with "a priori default skin" before I "re-loaded" the skin in the Settings->Tee
03:57 < user774> that is my teeworlds install:   /usr/share/games/teeworlds/data/skins/
03:57 < user774> dpkg -L teeworlds-data | grep default.json /usr/share/games/teeworlds/data/skins/default.json
03:59 < user774> something is pushing the "super-standard default.json" into existence even after the teeworlds install default.json is replaced with something else.
04:04 < user774> actually. this is probably a good thing. I see performance boosts with this setup.
04:06 < user774> It's like a "Hello, World!" C program where the "Hello, World!" is a string in the C file itself versus an external file being loaded into a string to be outputted via puts or whatever.
04:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> teeworlds must get its default.json somewhere, it's not hardcoded
17:22 < user774> hmmmm teeworld servers and fng servers aren't showing up in the server list
17:22 < user774> I tried resetting my ummmm
17:22 < user774> ~/.local/share/teeworlds     with freshness
17:23 < user774> 172 ddrace servers tho
17:25 < user774> oh there we go everything is back up  after a Refresh
19:33 < user774> what does this smiley mean:          uwu
19:33 < user774> versus:                  ovo
19:33 < user774> versus:                     owo
