01:10 < kma> Congrats on the new release :D
01:10 < kma> I played a bit, man it was great! :D
08:45 < kma> oh nice, the dilate / tileset border fix stuff came in :D
08:45 < kma> <3
10:11 < minus> still haven't played because my WM doesn't support mouse locking :/
10:47 < kma> oh rly?
10:49 < matricks> anyway, new version == great!
10:50 < matricks> which reminds me, I should pay for the domain :D
11:03 < minus> oh, it was matricks in disguise
11:03 < matricks> SPOOKY! :D
11:04 < matricks> looking at the code makes me a bit nostalgic :D
11:25 < matricks> the client update loop is pretty tight
11:30 < matricks> same with the engine update loop
11:30 < matricks> I've forgotten how easy the teeworlds code is
11:34 < reitw> matricks, easier than doom's code :v)
11:34 < matricks> which doom? :)
11:35 < reitw> 2016, the one you worked on
11:35 < matricks> oh, yeah :)
11:42 < Dune> o/
11:42 < Dune> that's a nice early christmas gift
11:55 < Dune> still into OOP-light code like Teeworlds', matricks?
11:55 < Dune> or your tastes changed
11:56 < matricks> not really, there is a couple of things I would have changed now but those I would have changed back then as well if I had the time
11:57 < matricks> looking through the code, there is a couple of peice in there I don't like
11:57 < matricks> like the CEntity::TickPaused() function should get removed
11:57 < matricks> clearer ownership of systems
11:57 <@heinrich5991> and it should actually pause the tick? :)
11:58 < matricks> well, should have two different ticks
11:58 < matricks> ServerTick and .. erh.. PlayTick?
11:59 < matricks> I do like how simplistic everything is tho :)
12:00 < Dune> yeah, Teeworlds is easy to understand :)
12:00 < matricks> I like how the threaded graphics and everything turned out actually
12:01 < matricks> that core loop becomes quite clean with that approach
12:01 < matricks> next step would be to remove the IGraphics interface and let the command buffers be the actual interface
12:01 < matricks> would reduce virtual calls a lot
12:05 < Dune> Oy planned a roadmap meeting at 7 btw, dunno if you heard. Maybe Ubu summoned you :)
12:06 < matricks> Ubu emailed me, I've answered his email and my plane leaves at 7:50 sooooo...
12:06 < matricks> There was a lot of talk about design etc
12:07 < matricks> I layed out the designing rules that guided me when I did the design way back
12:07 < matricks> many of the new stuff goes against those rules, but in the end, after quake 1 there was 2, 3, 4 and champions etc
12:08 < matricks> I'm sure he will share the email with everyone
12:08 < matricks> also, I personally don't have much todo with teeworlds anymore and it's up to you guys to decide what todo with it
12:08 < matricks> I only pay for the domain :)
12:11 < Dune> well, you still have guru status :)
12:12 < matricks> A guru is just an old dude sitting on a top of a mountain talking weird for a couple of years
12:12 < Dune> haha :D
16:27 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] msiglreith opened pull request #1919: Fix build for msvc (master...msvc_build) https://git.io/fhJHa
16:58 < matricks> I need to optimize teeworlds some more.. only have 800-1200 fps, it needs a vulkan renderer :D
16:59 < matricks> shit, I almost got 1 frame per scanline :D
17:18 < teetow> sup
17:18 < matricks> nut much
17:19 < teetow> just got my ass kicked, but then I realized the hammer is still awesome
17:19 < teetow> so
17:19 < teetow> all good
17:19 < teetow> nice release, guys. Like the new UI.
