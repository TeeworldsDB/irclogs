02:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> Could someone create a "issue" on Github for me? I wanted to mention that the filter system is able to filter for one specific mod but not to exclude one.
03:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Hm, how would you do that though? The filter list is a whitelist not a blacklist
08:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Not that I think you should include it but we added a second filter bar that's a blacklist instead, right next to the search one
11:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Right, we could. It's quite cramped in the sidebar though
11:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> We shoved it next to the search
11:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I mean for the gametype filter
11:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well an inverse search would also serve as a gametype filter
11:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> albeit not as accurate
11:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> true @ShootXen
