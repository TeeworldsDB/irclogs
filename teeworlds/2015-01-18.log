12:38 < Sirgue> Hi!
12:39 < Sirgue> Do you know if a French community still exists ?
12:40 <@matricks> I shot them all due to some cartoons depicting tees
12:41 <@matricks> whoaa.. that turned dark >:D
12:46 < Sirgue> matricks, huh :(
12:46 <@matricks> Sirgue: I don't know actually :)
12:47 < Sirgue> Okey :/ Because teeworlds.fr looks abandonned, and teeworlds.info is down
12:48 <@matricks> I felt very.. very old today when I started to backtrack teeworlds time
12:50 < Sirgue> I can understand. When did the project start ?
12:52 <@matricks> well, the very very very first version was written.. erh.. around... 13..14 years ago
12:52 < Sirgue> Omg :o
12:53 < Sirgue> And teeworlds still exist, it's pretty awsome x)
12:53 <@matricks> well, not those versions, but the one you are playing now I started to write in 2007
12:54 <@matricks> early 2007.. like.. around now
12:54 <@matricks> 8 years ago
12:55 < Sirgue> Did you start alone ?
12:55 <@matricks> yes
12:59 < Sirgue> It's very impressive
12:59 <@matricks> heh
13:00 <@matricks> you know that I am a game programmer right?
13:02 < Sirgue> No, i didn't. Wich games ? :o
13:02 <@matricks> a bunch
13:02 < Sirgue> (I should have listen in english classroom, my english is so bad ><)
13:02 <@matricks> moby has the list! 
13:02 <@matricks> http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,41843/
13:03 < Sirgue> Wow!
13:04 < Sirgue> Skyrim, Brink (but it was a flop in France), Wolfenstein
13:04 < Sirgue> Just Cause
13:04 <@matricks> Just helped out with porting work on skyrim and brink
13:05 <@matricks> didn't spend that much time on them
13:06 < Sirgue> Well, it's something
13:07 < Sirgue> And now, do you have a project ?
13:08 <@matricks> still working at MachineGames, the company that did wolfenstein, and what we do now I can't say
13:08 < Sirgue> Okey :P
13:08 < Sirgue> It's top secret :P
13:08 <@matricks> but I don't code that much on my spare time anymore
13:10 < Sirgue> Well, I can understand that. When you code at work, all the day, code at home.. x)
13:12 < Sirgue> Well, I have to buy a new domain
13:12 < Sirgue> But i have no idea
13:12 <@matricks> slam your head on the keyboard 3 times, thats your new domain name
13:12 < Sirgue> qsdffs
13:13 < Sirgue> .co.uk
13:13 < Sirgue> LOL
13:13 <@matricks> there you go
13:13 < Sirgue> "Quotient Sadomasochiste De la Fédération Française de Surf"
13:13 <@matricks> qsdffs.com is free it looks like
13:13 <@matricks> go for it
13:14 < Sirgue> Great !
13:14 <@minus> nah, get .moe instead, you know you want to
13:14 < Sirgue> My friend recently buy http://nyu.moe/
13:15 <@minus> *bought
13:15 <@matricks> QUICK!!! HIDE THE COOKIES!
13:15 < Sirgue> *bought :P
13:15 <@minus> cookies?
13:16 <@matricks> michal is gonna eat em all
13:16 <@minus> oh.
13:16  * minus doesn't see joins/quits
13:17 < Sirgue> .moe is 17€/year
13:18 <@minus> 17 cookies?
13:18 < Sirgue> New currency: BitCookies
13:18 < CookieMichal_> Sheet, How did u know?!
13:19 < CookieMichal_> *om nom nom*
13:19 < CookieMichal_> *
13:21 < Sirgue> Is there a teeworld's server french translation ?
13:22 < CookieMichal_> Ofc! Translation: le serveur de Teeworlds
13:22 < Sirgue> Huh ^^
13:23 < Sirgue> I mean, huh..
13:23 < Sirgue> (my english is sooo bad, i can't speak :( )
13:24 < Sirgue> Well, translate sentenses like "Sirgue entered the games", etc..
13:26 < Safa_[A_boy]> "foo joined the game"?
13:26 < Sirgue> Yep, joined*
13:26 < Safa_[A_boy]> That's from the client, Choose French from the language list
13:26 < Safa_[A_boy]> Server messages aren't translatable :(
13:27 < Sirgue> Oh, ok :/ But maybe server-side ?
13:27 < Safa_[A_boy]> It will require some changes to the client to send the current locale?
13:28 <@matricks> it's better for the server to just send an ID on what is happening and let the client produce a chat line for it
13:28 <@matricks> or present it some how
13:29 < Safa_[A_boy]> By that, The client source will contain about hundreds of messages.
13:29 < Safa_[A_boy]> s/hundreds//
13:30 <@matricks> not that many
13:30 < Safa_[A_boy]> Will, For each gametype?
13:30 < Safa_[A_boy]> Well*
13:31 <@matricks> still, not that many
13:31 < Safa_[A_boy]> Ok, So should I open a bug report?
13:31 <@matricks> dunno
13:31  * Safa_[A_boy] opened one for gettext
13:31 <@matricks> I know what I would do atleast :)
13:31 <@matricks> I would nuke translations from orbit, thats what I would do
13:32 < Sirgue> Hehe x)
13:32 < Sirgue> I'm agree, translations is a pain x)
13:32  * minus readies LOIC for matricks
13:33 <@matricks> the extra development complexity it adds are not worth it I say
13:33 < Safa_[A_boy]> Less than 20 lines is complex?
13:33 < Safa_[A_boy]> Ø©_Ø©
13:34 <@matricks> no, adding a string now requires the assistence of 20 people...
13:34 <@matricks> doing releases requires 20 people more or less
13:34 < Sirgue> This issue is very complex to resolve : https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-translation/issues/52
13:34 <@minus> doing release requires me too
13:35 <@minus> \o/
13:35 < Safa_[A_boy]> https://nkumar.fedorapeople.org/helloi18n/helloworld/helloworldnaive.c Â» https://nkumar.fedorapeople.org/helloi18n/helloworld/helloworld.c
13:35 <@minus> the only thing releases don't require is you, matricks
13:35 < Safa_[A_boy]> Sirgue: Solving this issue https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1300 will solve that ;)
13:36 <@matricks> the code doesn't get that more complex, it's testing that gets the added complexity
13:36 < Sirgue> Hey, it's you : :o
13:36 < Sirgue> ! *
13:36 < Safa_[A_boy]> :P
13:37 <@minus> actually it does, matricks, because of text rendering, layout
13:37 <@matricks> minus: yes, that as well
13:37 <@minus> that mainly falls back to testing though
13:37 < Sirgue> afk
13:37 < Safa_[A_boy]> This issue requires some tons of coffee: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/394
13:50 < heinrich5991> senior engine programmer :)
13:52 < Safa_[A_boy]> This SDL ..
