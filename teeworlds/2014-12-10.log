12:04 < mememem> hi guys, can someone please tell me where i can find the masterban list???
12:05 < mememem> masterserver banlist*
12:06 < mememem> https://mnus.de/tmp/master-bans.cfg not sure if im right but then my server shouldn't be banned
12:06 < mememem> but it isnt listed in serverlist
12:06 < mememem> :(
12:07 <@matricks> when the server starts up it usually gives some sort of info if it was able to register or not
12:07 < mememem> it seems that it registered successfully
12:07 <@matricks> are you and the server on the same LAN?
12:07 < mememem> the teeworlds server is hostet on a vserver
12:08 < mememem> hosted*
12:08 <@matricks> okey, dunno
12:08 <@matricks> can you connect to it?
12:08 < mememem> yea
12:10 < mememem> it was listed in server browser (ingame server browser, im using ddnet client) whilst i was connected to the server
12:11 <@minus> mememem: if your server is not listed in that text file, it's not banned
12:12 < mememem> ok good, but it isnt listed anywhere. tw version 0.6.3
12:12 < mememem> modded
12:17 < heinrich5991> mememem: IP?
12:18 < mememem> 31.214.242.128
12:18 < heinrich5991> mememem: I found some KoG servers
12:19 < heinrich5991> connected to one

12:42 < mememem> :D
12:43 <@matricks> I've also been scratching my head if that is a function that should really exist
13:59 <@minus> matricks: it's so embarrassing that you should change your name and address and get a new face via plastic surgery
14:00 <@matricks> minus: is redoing my teeth good enough?
14:01 <@minus> that might do

16:25 < greensnow> Hi, I have a question about the game source, can I share the source with github on an external website without author's knowledge?
16:31 < Learath2> greensnow: the teeworlds source you modified ?
16:31 < mememem> Maybye you'll need GitLab or something?
16:32 <@matricks> greensnow: read the licence
16:53 < greensnow> "(...) Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it freely (...)", I understand, software also means source?
16:54 < greensnow> yes, the teeworlds source I modified
17:01 < Learath2> there are only two clauses specifically about the source and those are the second and the third
17:04 < greensnow> "2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
17:04 < greensnow>   misrepresented as being the original software.
17:04 < greensnow> 3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution."
