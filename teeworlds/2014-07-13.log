10:08 <@matricks> I agree with your cat
10:10 <@minus> :3
10:11 <@minus> what's up, matricks? doing any fun projects at the moment?
10:19 <@matricks> naaa, just fiddling with rust at bit at times, I need to clean my appartment :)
10:19 <@matricks> and flying when I can
10:19 <@matricks> and my body hates me
10:50 < EastByte> mfw netcat goes 100% cpu sending a udp frame
10:51 <@minus> did you mean: udp segment?
10:51 < EastByte> maybe it's a segment and not a frame
10:51 < EastByte> dunno
10:53 < EastByte> I don't understand netcat
10:54 < EastByte> how does it even know whether a udp "segment" reached its destination
10:54 <@minus> it doesn't
10:54 < EastByte> then why does it exit
10:54 <@minus> because stdin was closed?
10:55 < EastByte> I just type 'asd' twice
10:55 <@minus> run it with -v
10:55 <@minus> maybe it got a ICMP port closed response
10:56 < EastByte> ah tcpdump was listening on the wrong interface
10:56 < EastByte> now I see a closed response
10:58 < EastByte> minus: can netcat be used as a plain udp listener? (not caring about source address/port)
10:59 <@minus> that's what it does?
10:59 <@minus> use -k to prevent it from closing maybe
10:59 < EastByte> it refuses further packets from another destination
10:59 < EastByte> ill try
10:59 < EastByte> no, -k doesn't help
11:00 < EastByte> it keeps running (kind of dead)
11:01 < EastByte> damn this can be done in three lines python
11:02 <@minus> was about to suggest that
11:03 <@minus> realistically it's more like 5 lines though
11:03 < EastByte> I'll see :D
11:09 < EastByte> hm I got 5 lines
11:12 <@minus> :D
11:13 < EastByte> nc -u eastbit.net 8222
11:13 < EastByte> print something to my thermal printer :D
11:13 < EastByte> it workx
11:14 <@minus> really?
11:14 <@minus> camstream please
11:14 < EastByte> but one line per second isn't that fast
11:14 < EastByte> nah
11:14 <@minus> fast enuf
11:27 <@matricks> PEW PEW PEW!
11:27 <@minus> matricks is all fired up
11:28 <@matricks> I should finish cleaning my appartment :)
11:28 <@matricks> like.. use one of those machines that suck
11:29 <@minus> apple computers?
11:29 < EastByte> ^
11:29 < PsychoGod_> apple cleaning machine ?
11:34 <@matricks> minus: they don't suck, they blow
11:34 < EastByte> dish washers?
