09:33  * matricks is going to implement vulkan support in teeworlds
10:20 < eeeee> nice
10:21 <@matricks> Vulkan, aka Mantle 2.0
10:21 <@matricks> or Mantle 1.0 perhaps :)
10:21 < eeeee> would solve our performance issues!
10:21 <@matricks> YAH!
10:21 <@matricks> luls
10:21 < eeeee> that we're having running with 512 clients on the same screen :\)
10:22 <@matricks> I've ran like.. 14-18 clients at the same time on my machine :)
10:23 <@matricks> on the breifs it looks kinda nice
10:24 <@matricks> and all are onboard.. except ms...
10:24 <@matricks> ofcause
10:24 < eeeee> btw isn't it kinda slow-ish to alternate between blitting argb textures and grayscale text
10:24 <@matricks> no
10:25 <@matricks> game use a lot of different texture formats for different things
10:25 <@matricks> nothing uncommon here, move along
10:25 < eeeee> but to colorize the text don't we have to use a different shader
10:26 <@matricks> huh?
10:26 < eeeee> well nvm, guess i dont have enough knowledge to lead a meaningful discussion on the issue
10:26 <@matricks> yeah :)
10:26 < eeeee> too lazy to learn though, i just want it to work fast0r
10:27 <@matricks> you mean that it would have to switch shaders in the background when switching from rgba textures to grayscale etc
10:27 <@matricks> we are using an old fixed function pipeline, how the drivers handles that in the background is unknown
10:28 <@matricks> if we wanted to speed up things, we should look into what actually the bottleneck is
10:28 < eeeee> yeah the problem is that ffp is not supported on mobile and web
10:28 <@matricks> last time I checked on poor gfxcards it's the fact that there is a bunch of overdraw which I reduced 
10:28 <@matricks> ffp?
10:28 < eeeee> fixed function pipeline
10:28 <@matricks> och.. fixed.. yeah
10:28 <@matricks> well, switching shaders isn't uncommon as wlel
10:29 <@matricks> depending on the bottle neck, different things needs to be done
10:29 < eeeee> no idea how much of a bottleneck that is, but switching shaders twice per ui label just feels redundant
10:30 <@matricks> I'm guessing that there isn't a switch there even
10:30 <@matricks> I guess one win would be to prebuild the vertex buffers for stuff like the tiles and text and stuff
14:34 < BotoX> https://status.botox.bz/
14:34 < BotoX> OS on sakura is running on a flash drive, I rsync it to the internal HDDs in case it dies, it dies during the rsync and deadlocks
14:35 < BotoX> and I am too lazy to drive to the DC
