10:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> do you mean Non-Fungible Tokens?
10:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> lol, meme-websites must explode with it
11:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> "invalid standard map" is such a bitch i literally cloned fresh from official github repo
11:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> gotta dl release \:D we should make sure that all versions of official maps are valid for the client also the latest version on github
11:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> isn't that a problem with the submodules?
12:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> how?
12:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> i did a git clone from tw maps and put it in the maps folder of mi server and then my 0.7 client yelled "invalid standard map" at me
12:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> my client might be a bit old maybe its fixed already tbh i do not know i just downloaded the 0.7.1 release archive and that worked
12:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> imo all versions ever published on github should be valid maps for latest clients
14:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> this is not how versioning works
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I think teeworlds maps are not downwards compatible, because the way the map-hash is computed has changed
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> but I don't know the version it changed
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what you can do is go backwards with the git-submodules as well
16:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> but the client could be upwards compatible and already whitelist maps later than the latest release
