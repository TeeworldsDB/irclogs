17:45 < Henningstone> heinrich5991: sorry, I have never had anything to do with mac :/ Only Linux and Windowsâ€¦

17:53 < Henningstone> Just a guess, but to me the error message looks like as if SDL was missing?
17:54 <@heinrich5991> probably. SDL is packaged, but maybe at the wrong place
17:55 < Henningstone> which https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=119634#p119634 would confirm... just trying to figure out what this install_name_tool is for :o
