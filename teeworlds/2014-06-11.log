12:06 <@minus> heinrich5991: a comma after the last item of an enum is a C++11 thing
12:06 < heinrich5991> mhmh
12:06 < heinrich5991> it was supported before, and I'd bet that it's already used somewhere
12:07 <@minus> yes and i don't think so
12:07 <@minus> grep ,\s*}?
12:08 < heinrich5991> storage.h
12:08 < heinrich5991> client.h
12:09 < heinrich5991> graphics.h
12:09 < heinrich5991> I guess there are more of them
12:10 <@minus> does that grep actually work like that?
12:18 < heinrich5991> no
12:18 < heinrich5991> I did it manually
12:18 < heinrich5991> \s doesn't catch newlines I guess
12:20 <@minus> prolly needs the multiline modifier
12:22 <@minus>  % ag ',\s}' does the job
12:24 < heinrich5991> I'm still waiting for someone to create a single-char command to replace ag :)
12:25 < heinrich5991> I mean, grep -> ack -> ag
12:25 < heinrich5991> you see the pattern ^^
12:26 <@minus> alias a=ag
12:27 <@minus> i need an alias for yaourt
12:43 < heinrich5991> what about ÿ ? :)
12:43 < heinrich5991> but yaourt actually types nice
12:50 <@minus> not really
12:51 <@minus> yao<tab> actually
12:51 <@minus> btw, i'm on i3 now, no more Xfce
12:52 <@minus> i'm using 10 workspaces and it's not enough :/
12:52 < heinrich5991> i3 <3 :)
12:52 < heinrich5991> what?
12:53 <@minus> workspaces 1,3,9 have an IDE running
12:53 <@minus> 4 email, 5 irc, 10 a text editor
12:53 <@minus> i need a 4k monitor
12:54 < heinrich5991> 2 web, 3 irc, 4 mail, 5 social, 0 junk
12:54 < heinrich5991> 1 is the workplace
12:54 < heinrich5991> 6-9 are for additional progrmas
12:56 <@minus> i run too many IDEs
12:56 < heinrich5991> I do not run a single one, except you count vim
12:56 < heinrich5991> what kind of IDEs?
12:56 <@minus> actually #9 has two IDEs running, 2x eclipse
12:56 <@minus> the other 2 are qtcreator
12:56 < heinrich5991> what are you doing? oO
12:56 <@minus> RAM 5108/7842MB
12:56 <@minus> working
12:57 < heinrich5991> 10199/12002
12:57 < heinrich5991> minus buffers/cache
12:57 <@minus> excl cache here
12:59 < heinrich5991> then it's 4575/12002 right now (I just looked at top and closed an unnecessary memory-hungry program (pavucontrol))
12:59 <@minus> 3762/7842MB after closing eclipses
12:59 <@minus> pavucontrol eats much? i have that open too
13:00 <@minus> "just" 24M
13:00 < heinrich5991> here it ate 10% of the ram
13:00 < heinrich5991> (until restart)
13:01 <@minus> that's odd
13:01 < heinrich5991> yea
13:34 <@minus> heinrich5991: do you know how/if i can move a windows out of a container into the parent container?
13:34 < heinrich5991> mod-shift-direction usually works
13:35 <@minus> up?
13:35 <@minus> ah, i see
13:35 <@minus> that was confusing
13:35 <@minus> because i had several nested splits
13:36 <@minus> thanks ♥
13:37 < heinrich5991> :)
13:39 <@minus> splitting is a bit confusing, because when you set it to splitting you don't actually see anything happening
13:50 < heinrich5991> you see a fat line where it will place the next window
13:50 < heinrich5991> look closely :)
13:53 <@minus> not really, no
13:56 <@minus> would be cool if $mod+Drag floatified windows
13:59 < BotoX> systemd is a virus
14:00 < BotoX> https://p.botox.bz/esix
14:00 < BotoX> When I do systemclt start mangatra it executes ExecStart AND(!) ExecStop
14:01 < BotoX> And I guess this is totally the wrong channel to complain about this, but maybe someone in here knows
14:01 <@minus> because a oneshot has no stop
14:01 <@minus> maybe
14:01 < BotoX> I tried with simple too, though
14:02 <@minus> is that a .service?
14:02 < BotoX> yeah
14:02 <@minus> use fstab and systemd will imply a .mount
14:02 <@minus> or something like that
14:03 <@minus> options noauto,x-systemd.automount
14:03 <@minus> or something like that
14:03 < BotoX> The problem is that fstab gets run before zfs.target
14:03 < heinrich5991> yea, this hsouldn't be a service
14:04 < BotoX> And I want to mount --bind a folder on the zfs mount to a chrooted SFTP
14:04 < heinrich5991> BotoX: might it be that the first command returns a status != 0 so it stops the service again?
14:04 < BotoX> https://p.botox.bz/iyap nope
14:05 <@minus> x-systemd-after?
14:07 <@minus> noauto,x-systemd.automount will cause a mount to be mounted when it is first accessed, BotoX
14:07 < heinrich5991> BotoX: have you run systemctl daemon-reload?
14:08 < BotoX> I did several times and also rebooted
14:08 < BotoX> x-systemd-after=zfs.target in the mount options should work, I guess
14:09 <@minus> not sure if that is implemented
14:10 < heinrich5991> BotoX: I think you need RemainAfterExit=yes
14:10 < heinrich5991> (looking at my network.service service file which actually works)
14:10 < BotoX> Or I guess I could just remove the ExecStop
14:10 <@minus> nah, he needs fstab
14:10 < BotoX> Yeah, that'd be the cleanest solution
14:11 < heinrich5991> but RemainAfterExit is the solution to the problem he explained :P
14:11 < BotoX> RemainAfterExit=yes is in my network service too
14:11 < BotoX> Yep, seems like that should work
18:11 < SlayerGV> We should remove or lower the tdm respawn delay.
18:12 < SlayerGV> dunno why even the issue of 2011 from Choupon (#877) was closed
18:12 < SlayerGV> this setting needs to be discussed!
18:59 < A__> teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
19:06 < EastByte> teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
19:06 < EastByte> :>
19:06 < Dunedune> SlayerGV: is there really a respawn delay if you do not suicide? oO
19:06 < Dunedune> isn't it 0.5 or 1s?
19:12 < SlayerGV> in tdm it is 3s
19:12 < SlayerGV> !!
19:13 < SlayerGV> Dunedune
19:17 < Dunedune> guess i haven't played enough of these, SlayerGV :(
19:17 < SlayerGV> just had some test matches for the tournament
19:17 < SlayerGV> and each player was like "wtf"
20:29 < heinrich5991> matricks: does the datafile class guarantee something about the layout of the items in the memory?
20:30 < heinrich5991> because I don't particulary like the code in maplayers.cpp
20:31 < heinrich5991> where
20:31 < heinrich5991> pPoints = (CEnvPoint *)pThis->m_pLayers->Map()->GetItem(Start, 0, 0);
20:31 < heinrich5991> and then pPoints gets used like an array
20:32 < heinrich5991> which totally depends on the datafile having all the items of the same type right next to each other
20:56 <@matricks> heinrich5991: all items of the same type comes after eachother
21:05 < heinrich5991> this is guaranteed by the Datafile class?
21:06  * minus manipulates a map file to cause an overflow or DoS
21:08 < heinrich5991> minus: you can easily do a segmentation fault
21:08 <@minus> bad.
21:09 < heinrich5991> yes
21:09 < heinrich5991> minus: rework it
21:09 < heinrich5991> also, no range checking whatsoever is in place
21:09 <@minus> heinrich5991: gib time pls
23:42 < elycsar> so should we all stay at the same hotel?
23:42 < heinrich5991> huh?
