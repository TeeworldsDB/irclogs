20:43 < Fin> hallo
20:44 <@minus> greetings
20:44 < Fin> heinrich oder auch alle anderen...welches ist das beste Linux für den Normalgebrauch als auch für tw?
20:44 < Fin> wich one is the best linux os for normal use and teeworlds?
20:44 < Fin> Cause win sucks
20:44 <@minus> there is no "best"
20:45 <@minus> Ubuntu or Mint generally work for beginners
20:45 < Fin> sure, but there is a better one :D
20:45 < Fin> what do u use?
20:45 <@minus> arch linux
20:45 < Fin> *wich one
20:46 < Fin> it s wich one? .D or what is differen between debian, mint and arch?
20:47 <@heinrich5991> just use ubuntu, mint or fedora
20:47 <@heinrich5991> arch sucks too
20:47 <@minus> mint is based on debian. arch does its own thing
20:47 < Fin> heinrich wich one you prefere?
20:47 <@minus> heinrich5991: you suck!
20:48 < Fin> txD
20:48 <@heinrich5991> Fin: have you use linux before?
20:48 < Fin> nein
20:48 <@heinrich5991> *used
20:48 < Fin> no :D
20:48 <@heinrich5991> then don't take arch
20:48 < koomi> mint is maintained by retarded monkeys
20:48 <@minus> yeah
20:48 <@heinrich5991> I guess minus' yeah was @ arch
20:48  * matricks is sporting xubuntu
20:48 < Fin> so? debian?
20:48 <@matricks> Fin: no
20:49 <@heinrich5991> debian is mainly for servers AFAIK
20:49 <@matricks> Fin: just go ubuntu or xubuntu or mint
20:49 <@minus> yeah, don't use arch unless you're good at linux and want to fix things by hand if they break
20:49 < Fin> ok thanks a lot
20:49 <@matricks> minus: I prefer things that don't break :D
20:49 <@minus> debian unstable works well enough as desktop
20:50 <@matricks> Fin: teeworlds begun it's development on xubuntu ;)
20:50 <@minus> i prefer bleeding edge software, matricks. i can fix breakages easily.
20:50 <@matricks> minus: I perfer not to bleed ;)
20:50 <@minus> but yeah, xubuntu (that is, Xfce) is nice, used that for years
20:50 <@heinrich5991> I heard fedora is bleeding edge without the instability of arch :)
20:51 < Fin> so you say ubuntu would be fine for me? and tw will work on it perfectly?
20:51 < koomi> nothing about arch is more unstable than any other bleeding edge distro
20:51 <@minus> but does it have as many packages as arch in AUR?
20:51 <@matricks> Fin: yes
20:52 <@matricks> Fin: I perfer xubuntu over ubuntu because it's more classical
20:52 <@matricks> but either one is fine
20:53 < Fin> ok, if ubuntu is the origin i will try this one...today i did win xp to win 7 but 7 sucks so hard, so i decided to upgrade to 10...but its still at 5 % downloading at the bar...so i thought fuck it...i ll take linux
20:53 <@minus> xubuntu got more of a windows 95y UI :D
20:53 < Fin> wich one is more like win? caus i dont know linux, but win
20:53 < rand> kubuntu/xubuntu
20:54 < rand> but, it's only about the GUI
20:54 < Fin> win 95 was realy nice, caus of no SysError 5 :D
20:54 <@matricks> win95 was a proper toy
20:54 <@matricks> not an OS
20:54 <@minus> yeah, i'd suggest xubuntu then
20:54 < Fin> so i will take Xubuntu :d last word :D
20:54 <@matricks> yap
20:54 < Fin> oh, and ist there somethin' like ppt or word , excel for linux?

20:56 <@minus> xubuntu will be fine on it
20:57 <@matricks> Fin: linux is just the core, ubuntu is a complete os
20:57 <@matricks> Fin: you can find linux pretty much anywhere, probably even in your pocket right now
