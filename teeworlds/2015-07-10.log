13:09 < BotoX> tfw I wrote a proof of concept script to scrape all students and their private data from my university （ ´_ゝ`）
13:09 < BotoX> just reported it to them
13:11 < BotoX> looks pretty bed for one of the biggest technical universities here in Austria haha
13:11 < Learath2> should have tested it before reporting it ^^
13:11 < BotoX> I did
13:11 < BotoX> Well I didn't get all the data
13:11 < BotoX> just a few tests
13:11 < BotoX> would be bad if they saw me downloading all of it
13:12 < Learath2> true
13:13 < BotoX> I've sent them the script
13:13 < BotoX> inb4 sent it to the wrong people kek
15:56 < green_snow> hello, when I compile teeworlds, I get following warning: warning C4530: C++ exception handler used, but unwind semantics are not enabled. Specify /EHsc
15:56 < green_snow> how can I fix this?
15:57 < laxadedi> teeworlds or ddnet ?
15:57 < green_snow> teeworlds
15:57 < laxadedi> you sure it's the official repo ?
15:57 < laxadedi> master branch ?
15:58 < green_snow> umm.. It's my own modified source
15:58 < laxadedi> Well
15:58 < laxadedi> It's not really the good channel
15:58 < green_snow> hm
15:58 < laxadedi> but I can tell you that
15:58 < laxadedi> it's probably cause you are trying to try / catch something
15:58 < green_snow> yes
15:58 < laxadedi> and compiler isn't configured with bam to compile it I guess
15:58 < laxadedi> never compiled any c++, but the error message is pretty clear to me
15:59 < green_snow> yes, I included some standard c++ libraries such as fstream, they use exceptions
16:00 < green_snow> is there any way to specify /EHsc?
16:00 < green_snow> or config bam somehow?
16:03 < laxadedi> it's probably some clang option
16:03 < laxadedi> you can modify bam.lua
16:03 <@minus> clang? that's MSVC
16:04 < laxadedi> Not anymore I think
16:05 < laxadedi> when I do gcc -v, I am getting LVVM + Clang output
16:05 < laxadedi> *LLVM
16:06 < laxadedi> green_snow: using the error given by bam, you should be able to find some useful informations on the web
16:06 < Learath2> C4530 is a msvc compiler warning tho 
16:07 < laxadedi> Oh right ^^
16:07 <@minus> /EHsc is a windows switch, too
16:08 < laxadedi> Sorry for misunderstand that
16:58 < shahan> hello
16:59 < shahan> can anybody please help me understanding the main meaning of generating extra headers during compilation?
17:00 < Savander> DRY
17:01 < shahan> i don't see anybody with such name here
17:01 < shahan> )))0
17:02 < Savander> Don't repeat yourself
17:54 < LittleWhite> Do you think, he got it ?
17:54 < Savander> idk
22:12 < BotoX> wat.jpg https://i.botox.bz/1436559129.png
22:14 < heinrich5991> BotoX: maybe min is defined as a macro as well?
22:14 < BotoX> wouldn't it show that then in the compiler output
22:15 < BotoX> oh god
22:15 < BotoX> I renamed it minasdasd
22:15 < BotoX> no more warning
22:15 < heinrich5991> ...
22:15 < BotoX> *error
22:15 < heinrich5991> try clang
22:15 < heinrich5991> maybe that shows the error
22:15 < BotoX> using i686-w64-mingw32-gcc
22:15 < BotoX> works fine with gcc
22:18 < BotoX> used some #ifndef magic to work around it :p
22:18 < BotoX> and macros instead
22:32 < BotoX> https://p.botox.bz/cice oh god what do
22:33 < BotoX> I tried linking in all the stuff that teeworlds uses, doesn't seem to help - as said before using mingw and trying to compile system.c for windows on linux
22:48 < BotoX> o-okay
22:48 < BotoX> chaning the order fixed it
22:48 < BotoX> libraries after objects
22:50 < heinrich5991> yeah
22:50 < heinrich5991> had that problem too
22:50 < BotoX> it works fine on linux gcc ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
