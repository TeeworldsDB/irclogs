11:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Is there some Wireshark dissector for 0.7 protocol already?
16:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> does anyone know how to add a g++ flag when compiling with bam?
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i see, i have to change the bam.lua
17:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> hey Dune, is there a way with bam to copy settings?
17:21 < Dune> what settings?
18:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i need -std=c++11 but only for the server
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so when compiling with bam, i need other settings for the server then for the rest
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> see bam.lua
18:07 < Dune> huuuh
18:07 < Dune> just add --std=c++11 everwhere
18:08 < Dune> https://pastebin.com/8Y2WX0Jn
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> doesn't work, bam tries to compile c files with -std=c++11
18:32 < Dune> is that a problem?
18:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes, teeworlds contains some c files? ðŸ˜„
18:33 < Dune> it  shouldn't throw any error when you do this though
18:36 < Dune> if it really bugs you so much, you can change settings there: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/158326d6743c4ef03a4a8beca98972c361425ca6/bam.lua#L145-L152
18:36 < Dune> instead of BuildGameCommon, and BuildEngineCommon you could split those functions in two, for the server and the client, and use different settings for both
18:36 < Dune> I don't see why the hassle thoguh
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I will show you the logs, give me some time
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> here just a part:
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> error: invalid argument '-std=c++11' not allowed with 'C'
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> bam: 'c src/engine/external/zlib/inffast.c' error 256
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> [ 39/732] [3] c src/engine/external/zlib/crc32.c
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> error: invalid argument '-std=c++11' not allowed with 'C'
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> bam: 'c src/engine/external/zlib/uncompr.c' error 256
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> [ 40/732] [1] c src/engine/external/zlib/infback.c
19:05 < Dune> @Assa go there https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/158326d6743c4ef03a4a8beca98972c361425ca6/bam.lua#L80-L103
19:06 < Dune> add the c++11 flag to settings after it is done compiling the *.c
19:06 < Dune> (e.g. line 101)
19:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> fixed see general ^.^
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so (as you may noticed) I now have github actions deployment
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> does it make sense to do a PR even if you don't use it?
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> not deployment - I mean continous integration
19:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't see any problem with that but I think @heinrich5991 mentioned a security issue with that
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> can someone help me with windows builds :(?
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> cmake
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> y
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> getting some weird IStorage conflicts
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> with windows' own libraries
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/zcatch/runs/252570418
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> OOF
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oof
21:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dunno, why
21:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ðŸ˜®
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> LOL, about my masterserver problem: I started my server at 1:54am, last night. Now, at 9:01 pm I connected and logged into rcon, before that, it said no problems detected, after that like at 9:03 it failed to find a master. How is that connected?
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it ran 17 hours without problems, and 2 minutes after I login to rcon it fails
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Well, I have added the ddracecommands stuff from DDNet 0.6, so the extra file for all rcon commands, but this shouldnt affect this?
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> mustr be this commit. As I said this weird behaviour appeared after I updated my mod to vanilla master. @Oy, can you look into it?
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/27012ac42d60fd38813ace8d931aeba721fb8aa8
21:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune i was not talking about my current PR for latest builds, just another build pipline config for github actions
21:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Thats why ddnet7 servers dont get this error, I didnt update ddnet7 to vanilla master, just my seperate mod
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @fokkonaut oy is not here, IStorage is just an interface and has some singleton behaviour, you should only have 1 instance. Hope this helps
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ?
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I think you mean @jxsl13
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I get a conflict between teeworlds IStorage (which does not live in a namespace) and windows' own STL? IStorage
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it seems
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I never touches anything in regard to IStorage
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> touched*
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @jxsl13 it seems like this broke my master server registration. I updated my source to master 5 and 9 days ago, so the failure commit has to be inbetween these 2 dates. this would fit in and could be it
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/ca1cd3837869d70427772521a3bd23485213ffe8
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> any ideaS?
22:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> my commit broke your stuff :O?
22:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's python
22:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Oo
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what does that script do btw
22:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I don't see any commit that do anything networking related
22:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's not my script, just did some improvements to it, that fetch master server data and server info data
22:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well, i just see some master server stuff in it
22:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea
22:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> that could fail
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I build my discord bot based on that
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> built
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> usually master server's don't fail, at least when I was using the script
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> they dont instantly
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> just after time
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> most of the time you need to retry fetching server data, as thos epackets seem to be lost
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> sometimes master server fails as well, but I'm handling is in the way that I don't update my current last fetched data
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if the master server response is empty
22:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i will revert the commit and try it again
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> lolololol
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> that commit is not in my fucking history
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that script doesn't do anything to teeworlds logic, lol xd
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> with magic:
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> magic.breakStuff();
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @fokkonaut this is a separate script, if you are not running it, it will not affect Teeworlds
22:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> The server can handle automatic demos from the client, right?
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> windoofs anyone ;'?
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> i windoof but bam
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I windoof, but don't support bam :c cuz cmake libs
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :'c
