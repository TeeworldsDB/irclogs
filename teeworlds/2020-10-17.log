12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> shit I just noticed I should have done a Teeworlds Among Us clone
12:44 < ChillerDragon> why?
13:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> free advertising for Teeworlds
13:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (Y)
13:41 < ChillerDragon> how?
13:41 < ChillerDragon> I assume you are not too serious and all but teeworlds is teeworlds its imo the best game already and a few fun modes won't make it mainstream.
13:42 < ChillerDragon> The game seems to have a hard time to spread and is maybe too hard or kirby like idk what the issue is exactly but it isnt a missing among us mod.
13:42 < ChillerDragon> Keep in mind we are also battle royal now ^^
13:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> same as the person that recreated Among Us in 3D in the Unity Engine
14:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> how exactly are we battle royal?
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> lms is basically battle royale
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> no it's not
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> "a fight, often to the death, in which more than two combatants are engaged and the victor is the last surviving participant." thats how battle royale works
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> with 64 players probably
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> = lms
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> = last man standing
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> there isn't a huge map and shrinking ring tho
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> ya but lms is  boring it's not what I would consider a fun battle royal expirence
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> those are particular features of a game
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> but the defition of battle royale is the one i quoted u
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> well tw battle royale mode sucks if that is what u think of battle royale ^^
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i dont think anything
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i just said it basically is battle royale
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> we just need a bigger lms map and a shrinking zone to have the combatants engage! And then it's basically Battle Royale, riight?
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> none worked on improving it so shrug
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> it is yea at it's most basic form which is why it's so boring ðŸ˜„
14:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> also getting lobbies without some matchmaking would be... difficult, to say the least ^^
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> @Stiopa a bigger map implies more player battle royals are known for having big lobbies
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I think for tw 32 would be fine to make an intresting expeerience but we need to spice it up with all the known mechanics that made battle royal so popular last few years
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> meaning loot economy, advancing gas/force field, crates and more but then some people start complaining tw is getting to complex what happend to KISS?! and u at a point where u go in circles
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> u cant just go and put something from another game into tw and it will instantly fit
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> raising lava could be nice idea to add tho
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> raising lava would limit u to one axis .. gas/ force field makes more sense
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> zCatch :3
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i didnt say that would be the only option
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> > there isn't a huge map and shrinking ring tho
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> > well tw battle royale mode sucks if that is what u think of battle royale ^^
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> > we just need a bigger lms map and a shrinking zone to have the combatants engage! And then it's basically Battle Royale, riight?
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> it was there since infClassR (and later in infcRoya)
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> And it works nice. Some old infClass players don't like shrinking safezone from Battle Royale, but it makes the game more dynamic and prevents endless camping..
15:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> teeworlds gameplay doesn't work so well with like 32 players PvP even with a big map
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> I don't talk about vanilla teeworlds now.
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Also about Among Us: social deduction element was introduced in team fortress teeworlds mod (a Spy class).
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> And it worked reasonably wekk.
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Also about Among Us: social deduction element was introduced in team fortress teeworlds mod (a Spy class).
15:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> And it worked reasonably well.
15:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> i mean vanilla doesn't have that so lms shouldn't count as battle royale, that is all i'm saying. :P
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Sure
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> > also getting lobbies without some matchmaking would be... difficult, to say the least ^^
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Matchmaking in fact really would be nice. It would solve biggest current teeworlds problem: skill gap in a PvP-only game.
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> I feel like noobs don't have anything in the game now beside misery and pain while players with 10 years of skill purposely (and sometimes not) making the game almost inplayable for them as newcomers have to deal with a masochist-like experience.
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> I think this filter removes at least 90% newcomers from the game. Matchmaking would be an option to make pvp battles rewarding for everyone.
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Dedicated pro/noob servers wouldn't solve that problem. Noobs are constantly leaving the game for good because of that skill gap. Pros could not be forced to stay on an empty pro server when there are players already on a noob one.
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> And yes, matchmaking would be hard to do because:
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 1. Player count is really low on vanilla tw gametypes now (CTF/DM/LMS)
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 2. Ranking/matchmaking system have to be implemented. This would require stats and accounts too.
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 3. It kinda offences the current teeworlds philosophy where you can join any server (though on clan servers you will mostly just spectate as nobody will allow you to play with pros)
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Problem no 1 doesn't seems to concerns anybody and everyone is focusing on coding, not on marketing and growing community.
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Problem no 2 is solveable. I've made a stats system for my mod and half-implemented auth system in it despite that my mod has expremely low player count (~100 uninque players weekly). Maybe I will propose that system to ddnet/tw/mod developers if they will be interested. I am about to implement ranking system based on player-player pairs interaction like in CS.
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Problem no 3 is the worst as everything in tw world is conservative to the point that nobody is really interested to experiment no matter what benefit it will introduce.
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> My current stats/auth system looks like this. It's a work in progress https://infnext.tw/ . Rank is score based, but I will make it player-player interaction based soon I guess.
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> As I want to see real player skill distribution in game.
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> > u cant just go and put something from another game into tw and it will instantly fit
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> So far that worked: zombies, battle royale safezones, team fortress mod, football, battlefield mod.
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Teeworlds is great for mods. If only we've had more support in this and if only the game will not be in such a state it is now: declining stage, player numbers are small, even vanilla gametype mods don't always have players to join to.
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> "problem no 3 is the worst as everything in tw world is conservative to the point that nobody is really interested to experiment" couldn't agree more, experimenting with new mechanics is fundamental to get Teeworlds back on track and community excited as an example so many people have been anticipating slopes for years now and we still have nothing going towards it which is a shame since even us the gfx team back in 2012 where alrea
