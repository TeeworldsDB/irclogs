09:03 < day_> what are the key features of 0.7?
09:04 <@matricks> A Lot(tm)
09:10 < day_> :D
09:11 < day_> tbf. i cant really think of anything that im missing. except maybe proper game mode filtering "dm" shows also "tdm"
09:12 < day_> which wasnt an issue due to the small amount of populated servers, well it still isnt really one
09:12 <@matricks> there is a lot that you can do :)
09:12 < day_> im especially good at complaining
09:12 < day_> :)
09:12 <@matricks> has the player count gone up now with the steam release?
09:13 < day_> definitely
09:13 < day_> im used to seeing maybe 4 populated dm servers
09:13 < day_> now there are a gazillion
09:16 <@matricks> HAAHA
09:17 <@matricks> I read a review for teeworlds, he thought it was unfair because new players doesn't have a chance against people who have played 1 year+ :)
09:17 <@matricks> GOOD!
09:42 < day_> tbf. the scaling is way to insane. now that im almost at the top, im not complaining but its just demoralizing :D
09:43 <@matricks> the scaling?
09:43 < day_> well time wise/training wise. not game/item wise
09:43 <@matricks> the whole game is designed to bring out differences in players
09:44 <@matricks> in cs etc you can get lucky with a random HS och feel like you've done something, here, not so much
09:44 <@matricks> there is no random
09:46 < day_> random headshots in cs are what nade spam kills are in teeworlds :P
11:00 < rand> > there is no random ‚Üê i wonder sometimes
14:29 < BotoX> holy shit
14:29 < BotoX> the activity on github
19:29 < Fels> oink
