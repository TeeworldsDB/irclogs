00:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> first zoom client seen üòÑ nice, there we go
00:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> earlier than expected
00:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> who made it?
00:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that I cannot tell üòÆ
00:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it was most likely a private client for now.
00:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> join the zCatch discord for more drama üòÑ
00:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and more evidence
00:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *spookey and exciting*
01:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> this is crap
01:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> soon they will start ddosing the masters too, and making lots of bots again
02:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is this line a potential bug if one expects the underlying array/memory to contain garbage, especially a bit set to 1 at the position of the extend bit when the i evaluates to 0, due to the |= the value of the extend bit is not forced to 0?
02:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/b7e76314023664658b9f119bb80c9bf3d7c26361/src/engine/shared/compression.cpp#L23
02:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the 0 part should also be negated with ~(0 << 7)
02:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> inverted*
04:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, kind of not a problem it seems. as it breaks in the 0 case.
07:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @jxsl13 üëçüèº
07:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @jxsl13 zillywoods has zoom for weeks already
07:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> months
08:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @jxsl13 ... could have at least co authored me in the commit
08:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if you dont merge xd
10:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :/ didn't think about that.
11:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> guide to write zoom client
11:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> copy zilly woods
11:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> fin
11:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I doubt that zilly has this as an ingame feature :0, that would be zilly.
11:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ddnet people usually consider that as not-a-cheat because it's PvE, and they restrict it to race gamemodes
12:27 < Learath2> https://gist.github.com/Learath2/e0ebd13d3a7aad08ca96a9e658ae28d3 found it, this parses the output of heinrich5991's tool and outputs identifiers that are named incorrectly
12:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @jxsl13 of course it is an ingame feature
12:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i love how it has a "Secret" icon next to it
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I mean ingame as not in spectators.
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> Ddnet should somehow not share zoom code, its SO easy to remove the gametyp restriction
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> Useless
16:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @ÔºÉ6909 Its SO easy to just recode it
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> I dont even know c++, but i can easily remove the restriction, although i cannot recode it myself
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Skayland [identifyy host|msg me] you can change one line in the vanilla client to get a zoom client
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> make that an official ingame feature :D
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hehe
16:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> @heinrich5991 never really checked vanilla client source, only server part, so idk
16:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> "4:03 PM] Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]: Ddnet should somehow not share zoom code, its SO easy to remove the gametyp restriction"
16:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> "[4:55 PM] Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]: @heinrich5991 never really checked vanilla client source, only server part, so idk"
16:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> Ye, what
16:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> zoom code is in vanilla, yet you complain about ddnet
16:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> Remove it from vanilla then
16:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> What is it? Editor zoom?
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> leople call it dyn cam.
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> people
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's not what I'm talking about
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> Dyn cam is not zoom
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> remove zoom -> have to remove dyn cam
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> this is a different discussion and not the one we just had
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no, regular ingame "zoom", @Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> What i mean is its too easy to get a zoom client or a bot client, things should be different
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it's way too easy to get a cheat client for cs:go
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and arguments like: it jas always been here, that's wuy it can't be removed are no arguments :'(
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> valve makes millions with the game
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yet they're unable to prevent client-side hacks
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> cuz serverside is flawed.
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no.
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> in our case
17:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you will always be able to gain an advantage by zooming out, as long as we don't want to introduce ping artifacts for players playing with the normal client
17:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> i.e. players randomly appearing, **even without dyncam** @jxsl13
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah, the advantage of the range that is being used to allow for a proper entity alpearance, but the whole dyn cam range to all sides is kind of over the top.
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> appearance
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so you'd be here today to complain about zoom clients as well, I guess, if we didn't have dyncam. but they would have a smaller impact (I guess(?)), so fair
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> There is no way to combat cheat well. The cs example shows that well. Now imagine a FOSS game with no budget
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> cs:go shows that even a large budget does not help
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> check noby's server for a good approximation of anticheat
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Dunno, maybe I would if I had solutions to offer.
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> To be fair, the cheat vector would be much smaller without dyncam indeed
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> doesn't change what's here and now.
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I see plenty of people enjoying the game without constantly worrying about bots üôÇ
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I feel the worries also destroy some of the fun people have, as the bots do as well
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I don't play that much race mods, so I can only speak for mods that are more impacted by those exploits than others.
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @heinrich5991 got the same feeling. And it gives publicity
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I was mostly talking about FNG in that statement
17:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, dunno about fng, but having high mouse sense + zoom kind of gives you the advantage. but yeah, currently there might not be that much stress until one of these clients becomes publicly available.
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it looks to me, that something is done after the exploits have been distributed, like in 0.6, not the other way around. it seems that the 0.8 iteration is earlier to come than 0.7 was. just waiting and seeing the house burn, that's what imma do :)
17:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Nothing is going to be done after exploits are distributed and this kind of condescending attutude helps no one
17:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> why was the masterserver fixed then:D?
17:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> because it was possible to fix it
17:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there are some things that are unfixable, as we discussed earlier. you can try to make them harder
17:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is the fake ping part fixable?
17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> thinking about it from a network perspective, no
17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the server cannot see when you start sending your packets
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so you can always back-date them
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah, thought so
17:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> was teehistorian ported to 0.7? preferrably in an encapsulated class
17:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ?
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, it was
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I ported it over
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the same way "encapsulated" as in 0.6
17:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm k
17:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> best feature ever, btw
17:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> should be part of vanilla
17:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> imo
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I'm not sure what use it is right now
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> once‚Ñ¢Ô∏è we get playback support, it might be nice for testing gameplay
17:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's nice for the ML people to come
17:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe some crownsourcing
17:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> who knows
17:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Assa came regardless :D
17:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> he's the weirdest of those folks üòõ
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what?
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I am unable to be up to date on all what happens on the bridge
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> apparently you are part of the "ML folk"
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i was part of the TW folk before the ML folk
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> in fact i am programmer because of TW
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> :)
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> if you want something like vac-net we prob. need labeled data and RNNs
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> like GRUs or LSTMs
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and @heinrich5991 comparing teeworlds to cs:go is comparing apples to microwaves
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm?
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the most requested feature in cs is a better anticheat
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what I'm saying is that it's futile to try to prevent client-side cheats
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that only makes heinrich's point stronger?
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe i should keep reading üòÑ
17:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ping faking is impossible, but you can make it impossible to make yourself a better ping
18:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> oh true, that would be possible
18:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *prevent ping faking
18:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but I think the other way around was the interesting one
18:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the problem is the other way a round, making a worse ping
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but that's seemingly not possible
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> no, you can do this with network equipment
18:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> default client, default server, and a bad firewall
18:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the idea is to have a good ping but display a bad ping
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what do you gain from this in teeworlds?
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> in cs you have a lagswitch, in teeworlds you only interpolate server side
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *client side
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> having a hypothetical advaptive field of view based on latency
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> nothing at the moment
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but that's seemingly not possible
18:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> since the internet in germany is garbage, and people still get randomly timeouts with their non-vectorized copper cable, I don't see any way to prevent this
18:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's not called a fake ping, that's called a real garbage ping
18:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
18:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> can you tell the difference from server side?
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's the question
19:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> What about fake version? Is that considered some kind of cheat?
19:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't see what you can exploit with that
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's not a cheat, that's just the possibility for clients tobadvertise as modified, if they want.
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> To become a ML folk just use lots of acronyms, make it sound smart and you are ready, oh and some tensorflow here and there where u use already made models/layers which u have no idea how they are done internally but works (tm)
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> our AI lectures are bad as fuck, so I'm not hooked on ML
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> without understanding the stuff behind it it's also boring as hell
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ping
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Ryozuki I use Pytorch which means i actually understand what I am doing
22:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and the input and output layer size is given by the problem, you can find in between values with hyperparameter searches
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is it worth giving the source code of my mod to a guy for 150‚Ç¨?
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I cant really decide, was so much work for me and all that just grew together with me xd
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Cant just release it I feel
22:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> depends on what 150‚Ç¨ means for you I'd say :)
22:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's not like you can't use it anymore though
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> true
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Well 150‚Ç¨ isnt really much for me, its just a bit
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But on the other side
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> For a mod of teeworlds xd
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its quite a lot I'd say
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Mhhh
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> If you don't know what you'd do with that money, I'd say no
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> good point
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Because I actually have no idea xD
22:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It's quite nice to have your mod be valuated this much, and even if you refuse this gratification will remain
22:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It's a recognition of your work :)
22:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> True :)
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I put a lot of effort in it and a lot of time ü•∫
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It's not like it's going away, just someone will build on top of it though :p
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> dunno if I can handle that xD
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> It slike
22:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @fokkonaut give me the mod for free and the contact to him pls
22:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> haha
22:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I have made this for me, and for me its hard to share it like this, if someone would have just come and asked if i could help with a mod or develop something for him its no problem
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I've never made anything closed source though. It sucks when people take credit for you work but meh
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> for one person 150‚Ç¨ might be nothing, but for me it means 2 new pants
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> pants are important
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> y, i just have 3 or 4 left
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Uhm
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we should have a marathon, #modsforpants
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> xD
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> #pantsformodders
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> 75‚Ç¨ a pair though?
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> im also thinking about what others would do with my mod and how they would look at my code, but atm i never know
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> bcs i didnt make it public yet
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> oh you are right @Dune i could get new shoes too üòÆ
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @fokkonaut i think nobody of us ever made money from teeworlds
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I already did
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i think i need to do a city mod with vip oO
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Another guy gave me 50 bucks for some littlw features i already made for my mod xd
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so 50‚Ç¨ for 5min copy paste from my mod xd
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> And i am here just being open source, what a mistake!
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Man my heads in such a struggle right now xd
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Assa you'd have free time & energy to do teeworlds for ‚Ç¨ if someone asked you?
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I want a cigarette
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but im already in bed lol sux
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> is it weird that I review my own commits/ code on github in my freetime like on the bus? xd
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or in bed before i sleep? xd
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> sometimes
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune i have "freetime" for everything for ‚Ç¨ if someone asked me
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> seriously, if sb. paid me for tw i would do it
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Just as me
22:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @fokkonaut it's not weird, i usually check new comments on issues i made (or commented)
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I have a huge talent for finding bugs and breaking stuff
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i would like others to review my code
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> somehow
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> aww man its so hard, so much stuff thats unique and awwwww im in a conflict with myself
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i have issues for mxnet (DL-Framework) or the "ray" framework (for example)
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> waaaait a second
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> on the other side
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I managed to break microsoft's `azure functions`, too
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I can use github actions unlimited the
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> then*
22:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> If I go open src for example
22:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, if one has time to do it in their free time, why not get paid as well üòÆ
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ü•∫

22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> How to update your teeworlds to latest version
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nah i do it differently
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the bad way basically
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> üòÑ
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> x)
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> why the bad way?
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I don't know what differently means yet, but I see the apocalypse incoming
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> git checkout master
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> git pull tw master
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> git checkout branch
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> git merge master
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> solve conflicts, push
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> if it starts with `open new repository` i see black
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> oh yeah, merge everything on master
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> my master is not the tw master, so rip üòÑ
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what could go wrong
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> mine is ^^
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> so I'm doing basically assa's way
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> without commandline, tho, sublime merge ftw üòÑ
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you usually should only push working stuff on the master
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think the master is 0.6 zCatch from teelevision and my modifications or something like that
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> master should stay stable, that's why my repositories usually have a `master` and a `dev` branch
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> not ideal, I'd say
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> idealy you have more branches
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> master, dev, feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, hotfix 1, hotfix 2
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> got a 0.7 branch
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> features are only merged in dev, hotfixes in everything, dev is allowed in master
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> OR LIKE ME PUSH ALL DIRECTLY
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> teesmash best mod ü§ó
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @fokkonaut gh-actions will tell you if your master stays stable
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> teesmash needs polishing ._.
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> my master is vanilla master
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> My branch is my mod
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but it's fun
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> @jxsl13 i ported it in 1 day i guess yes
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> xd
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> and i ported it from scratch
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> base concept works fine
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i ported ddnet in one day
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 20hours pure copy pasting
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I ported zCatch in 4 months
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (well, to get a working ddnet7)
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> not with no bugs
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i ported Catch64 and gctf from 0.7.3 in 5 minutes
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> My own mod has got so many fixes which would be good for ddnet7 too
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I ported vanilla basically in no time at all
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i should apply them
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> > seriously, if sb. paid me for tw i would do it
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Assa 
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> then port ddnet++ to 0.7 i think i was offered also over 100 bucks to do it
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> because I didn't port it üòÆ
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon lmao
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> impossible
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> git remote add ddnet
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> git remote add teeworlds
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh and @Assa i would pay you 50 bucks if you port ddnet client to 0.7
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> git pull ddnet master
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> git pull teeworlds master
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> git pull --rebase
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> merge until you die
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> is there a other way to get the client id from within ccharactercore thats not like this? https://github.com/Ryozuki/teeworlds/blob/teesmash/src/game/gamecore.cpp#L250
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> altho the way i did it looks dope
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> character has a player pointer
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> player pointer stores CID
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Ryozuki ddnet passes the client id from character.cpp
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> im not talking about ccharacter breo
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> into the core
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> im talking about ccharactercore
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ye
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> yeah but i didnt want to pass anything
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> It throws it in
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> so i did this `this - *m_pWorld->m_apCharacters` which i think its smart :D
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> m_Core.m_Id = playergetcid
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dunno, I'm trying not to touch vanilla code most of the time x)
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe i could proxy 0.6 servers
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> teehistorian for vanilla! f3
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> imagine a proxy sever which just works as converter between 0.7 and 0.6 netcode

23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> they
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im sure some1 in the irc bridge is rly pissed of rn and being like "in the ol* days we had no teens spamming in #teewortlds"
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I guess we should spam on a different channel as the iirc bridge by the way
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> ye
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I don't see the problem
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the young from today found the irc bridge, everything is lost now, no hope left
