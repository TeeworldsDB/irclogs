09:12 <@minus> someone was being funny in the pawn wikipedia article: Pawn is a C-like Scripting Language and web-scale
09:20 <@matricks> :p
12:34 < CuBe_> hi, anyone here has some old maps ? I'm looking for pocram_winterbase or snowbase or something like that.
14:41 < DoNe> i still got the problem with my teeworlds server i made some tests and shared the results on pastebin i hope you can help me: http://pastebin.com/kiXB1JR9
14:45 <@minus> i'm busy right now but i'll go check later
14:46 <@minus> just need the ip/port of a running tw server on your machine, DoNe
14:52 < DoNe> 84.38.65.222:8303 running a 0.6.2 standart tw server
15:04 < DoNe> i even cant connect to the server in the server console it says client dropped. cid=0 addr=217.188.229.204:50844 reason='Timeout', @minus
15:05 < heinrich5991> do you have a standard client? does the map loading take very long (client-side)
15:40 < DoNe> heinrich5991 no my client loads maps fast and it is dm1
16:00 <@minus> DoNe: well, fix your firewall
16:00 <@minus> that server is not reachable
16:00 < DoNe> look at log 3, why does it work? @minus
16:01 <@minus> because tcpdump captures stuff that the firewall then drops?
16:01 <@minus> iptables -L output please
16:02 < EastByte> you can't trust tcpdump :D
16:04 < DoNe> iptables -L Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT) target     prot opt source               destination          fail2ban-ssh  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports ssh  Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT) target     prot opt source               destination           Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT) target     prot opt source               destination           Chain fail2ban-ssh (1 references) target     prot opt source         
16:04 <@minus> interesting
16:04 < EastByte> there is a problem
16:05 < DoNe> im searching for a week
16:05 < DoNe> i just dont know whats wrong
16:05 <@minus> do a nc -uvl 8301 on the server and let me send something there
16:06 < DoNe> should i stop the server before?
16:06 <@minus> or just use an unused port
16:07 < DoNe> and i DONT get this: ERROR: configure your firewall/nat to let through udp on port ####
16:08 < DoNe> running: nc -uvl -p 8380
16:08 < DoNe> udp needs -p
16:08 < DoNe> i got it
16:08 < DoNe> XXXXXXasdf test hello
16:08 <@minus> inferior gnu-netcat needs -p
16:08 <@minus> superior openbsd-netcat does not
16:09 < BotoX> minus: fail2ban finaly supports systemd journal! :D
16:09 <@minus> BotoX: never used it
16:09 <@minus> DoNe: can you send something back?
16:09 < BotoX> using it on my server
16:10 < BotoX> okay, why the fuck does iptables -L take ages
16:10 <@minus> DoNe: send something to mnus.de 8303
16:11 <@minus> because it's looking up shit from HDD and your IOwait is shit
16:11 <@minus> use -n
16:11 < DoNe> and -u?
16:11 <@minus> not you
16:11 < BotoX> htop minimal iowait
16:11 < DoNe> ah
16:11 < DoNe> i sent it
16:11 <@minus> interesting
16:11 <@minus> it arrived
16:12 <@minus> or maybe it was BotoX
16:12 < BotoX> I've sent dicks :v
16:12 < DoNe> i sent hi how are you
16:12 <@minus> yeah, only BotoX's arrived
16:12 < heinrich5991> minus: remember how we had a similar problem when we tried setting up a master server on my vps?
16:12 < DoNe> echo "hi how are you" | nc -u mnus.de 8303
16:13 < BotoX> yep, that should work
16:13 <@minus> there's the problem, you can't send udp
16:13 <@minus> let's try with TCP
16:13 < BotoX> which ISP?
16:13 < DoNe> ready for tcp?
16:14 <@minus> DoNe: go
16:14 < DoNe> the command dont gives me the curser back
16:15 < DoNe> dont know how to say it
16:15 < BotoX> it doesn't terminate
16:15 < DoNe> yes right
16:15 < BotoX> it keeps the connection open, just ctrl+c
16:15 <@minus> eh, something seems wrong on my end
16:15 < DoNe> okay
16:15 < DoNe> haha
16:15 < BotoX> you didn't get mine either, minus?
16:15 < BotoX> ah yep, can't connect haha
16:16 <@minus> eh, use port 2000
16:16 < BotoX> nc: connect to mnus.de port 2000 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
16:16 < BotoX> nvm, works nwo
16:16 < DoNe> now i have the same
16:16 < BotoX> I guess you haven't started it yet :v
16:16 <@minus> i got yours DoNe
16:17 < DoNe> k
16:17 <@minus> try again with udp to port 2000
16:17 <@minus> hello to you too, BotoX
16:17 < BotoX> :3
16:18 < EastByte> the figlet thingie was mine
16:18 < BotoX> DoNe: Which provider are you using?
16:18 < BotoX> haha
16:18 <@minus> EastByte: didn't get nothing
16:18 < EastByte> okay good
16:18 < DoNe> i tried 5 tiems
16:18 < DoNe> my vserver is from ispOne
16:19 <@minus> /something/ on your end is blocking outgoing UDP
16:19 < DoNe> yes ill check that
16:19 < DoNe> but
16:19 <@minus> probably your provider
16:19 < DoNe> ahhh and tcpdump is showing it but it dont get out ....
16:19 < DoNe> how mean
16:20 < DoNe> thanks ill check that
16:20 <@minus> yeah, your provider is probably dropping it somewhere
16:20 <@minus> a udp traceroute might show where
16:21 < DoNe> traceroute to mnus.de (84.200.43.61), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets  1  195.42.114.130 (195.42.114.130)  0.142 ms  0.153 ms  0.117 ms  2  * * *  3  * * *  4  * * *  5  * * *  6  * * *  7  * * *  8  * * *  9  * * * 10  * * * 11  * * * 12  * * * 13  * * * 14  * * * 15  * * * 16  * * * 17  * * * 18  * * * 19  * * * 20  * * * 21  * * * 22  * * * 23  * * * 24  * * * 25  * * * 26  * * * 27  * * * 28  * *
16:22 < DoNe> it just gives me "*"'s
16:22 < DoNe> oh i wondered before because i got this problem some times before
16:22 < BotoX> wait, no UDP, that means no DNS either
16:23 <@minus> BotoX: probably whitelisted
16:23 < BotoX> ya, probably
16:23 <@minus> it is
16:23 <@minus> traceroute -p 8303 -U 84.38.65.222
16:23 <@minus> times out
16:23 <@minus> traceroute -p 53 -U 84.38.65.222
16:23 <@minus> succeeds
16:24 <@minus> the hop before the server drops
16:24 <@minus> complain to them about their shitty firewalling
16:24 <@minus> but i'd rather move away from such a shitty provider (that's my personal opinion)
16:25 < DoNe> why they changed something before a week all worked :/
16:25 < BotoX> maybe they got attacked and blocked UDP
16:25 < DoNe> they cant just block UDP omg 
16:28 <@minus> also, that provider has  rather bad peering
16:29 < BotoX> http://lowendbox.com/tag/germany/
16:29 <@minus> BotoX: happen to know any cheap storage offers like OVH's 10TB one?
16:29 < BotoX> free 10TB in china
16:30 <@minus> sounds like bad bad bandwidth
16:30 < BotoX> http://www.weiyun.com/act/10t-en.html?WYTAG=weiyun.portal.index
16:30 < BotoX> I've got one, speeds are okay from home
16:30 <@minus> how does one access it?
16:31 <@minus> must be able to mount as a file system
16:31 < BotoX> shitty webUI
16:31 <@minus> nothing else?
16:31 < BotoX> https://github.com/shelmesky/weiyunfs
16:32 < BotoX> I haven't tried it yet
16:32 <@minus> https://github.com/shelmesky/weiyunfs/blob/master/weiyunfs.c
16:32 <@minus> i don't think so
16:32 < BotoX> lol.
16:33 < DoNe> lol
16:33  * minus np: Queen - The Show Must Go On
16:34 < DoNe> thanks for testing guys and thanks for the link botox ill think about moving away form the provider
16:34 < DoNe> bye
16:36 <@minus> actually, i have an idea
16:36 < BotoX> tell me
16:36 <@minus> why not just use webhosting that offers unlimited storage
16:37 <@minus> online.net, 6€/month
16:37 < BotoX> what's wrong with hubic?
16:37 <@minus> 10mbit/s
16:37 < BotoX> and what do you need the storage for?
16:37 <@minus> to store my music online
16:37 < BotoX> Didn't they get rid of that?
16:37 <@minus> when i tried it didn't get good speeds
16:38 <@minus> also, why 10€ for 10TB instead of 6€ for unlimited
16:40 < BotoX> http://url.cn/OsAOTX - only thing on my chinese 10TB
18:57 < nameless_tee08> hi

19:23 <@minus> i just saw your email

19:29 <@minus> well then, sTeupehT, looks like your ban won't be lifted for a while. in the meantime, chill and reflect on your behaviour.
19:30 < sTeupehT> so awhile as in like a day?
19:31 < Dunedune> does that look enough to you to reflect on your behaviour?
19:31 <@minus> a while as in forever
19:31 < sTeupehT> an hour sounds like enough imho
19:32 < sTeupehT> please mister I won't do again :(
19:32 < BotoX> huh, what did he do?
19:32 < sTeupehT> I offered plastic surgery to minors

19:43  * matricks is confused
19:43 < sTeupehT> minus was a little vague on his response
19:43 < sTeupehT> said I'd be unbanned in like an hour or so
19:44 <@matricks> sTeupehT: okey. I don't know which thread is yours.. just wait until your ban expires and we can talk again
19:44 < sTeupehT> wait
19:44 < sTeupehT> are you someone of authority/
19:44 < sTeupehT> cuz uh, I can let you in on a little secret if you unban me
19:44 <@matricks> oh.. bribes! I hate bribes!
19:45 < sTeupehT> I know how to get more ram quickly, you just have to download it.
19:45 <@matricks> oh.. viruses!
19:45 < sTeupehT> don't worry about the details, I have it all worked out
19:45 < sTeupehT> no no, no viruses
19:45 < sTeupehT> you can googlecheck if you'd like
19:45 < sTeupehT> here just google downloadmoreram
19:45 < sTeupehT> it's a legit site
19:45 <@matricks> either, you are a troll, or just very very bad with computers
19:45 < sTeupehT> no
19:45 < sTeupehT> it worked for me
19:46 < sTeupehT> i can play teeworlds like 20% faster
19:46 <@matricks> ... teeworlds isn't ram hungry...
19:46 < sTeupehT> it feels memory heavy
19:46 <@matricks> it's not
19:46 < sTeupehT> anyways the extra ram helped

19:47 < sTeupehT> 4.89 star video, it's good
19:48 < sTeupehT> so are you able to lift my ban? :3
19:48 <@matricks> ram is hardware, you can't modify it with software, you can do some fancy trade off and do in-ram compression
19:48 < sTeupehT> doesnt explain why downloading more ram helped me
19:48 < sTeupehT> i think they explain it somewhere
19:48 < sTeupehT> ill try to find it
19:48 < sTeupehT> they use very complex algorithms
19:48 <@matricks> haha :D
19:49 <@matricks> this is such a rip-off :)
19:49 < sTeupehT> no, the ram is free
19:49 <@matricks> nope
19:49 <@matricks> can't be
19:49 < sTeupehT> it evens goes through CNET
19:49 < sTeupehT> so you know it's legit

19:50 < sTeupehT> is that supposed to be a ram stick? lol those things dont exist
19:50 < sTeupehT> nothing could be so fragile and yet so powerful
19:50 <@matricks> okey, you are a troll
19:50 < sTeupehT> wtf
19:50 < sTeupehT> don't accuse me of being a troll pls
19:51 <@matricks> then you are an gullable fool
19:51 < sTeupehT> are you saying you wont unban me
19:51 <@matricks> no, I'm gonna ban you from this channel as well
19:51 < sTeupehT> wait what

19:51 < sTeupehT> I just downloaded like 10 more kilobytes of ram
19:52 <@matricks> that video is a total troll video and utter bullshit
19:52 < sTeupehT> no it explains what the bullshit was
19:52 <@matricks> lol
19:53 <@matricks> then take out your ram-sticks from your computer and see how it works without it
