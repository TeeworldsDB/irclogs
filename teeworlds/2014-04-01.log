00:46 < JulianAssange> google maps: pokemon edition
00:46 < JulianAssange> lol.
02:11 < JulianAssange> so 
02:11 < JulianAssange> MAX_VOTE_OPTIONS
02:11 < JulianAssange> i raised that to 512
02:11 < JulianAssange> on my server
02:11 < JulianAssange> recompiled and reran the srver.. and nothing bad happened
02:11 < JulianAssange> is this normal?
02:12 < Maimer> what were you expecting to happen?
02:12 < JulianAssange> client crash maybe?
02:28 < JulianAssange> can someone tell me what hte 'LAN' tab is supposed to do?
02:28 < JulianAssange> is it to list all servers on local netowrk?
02:28 < JulianAssange> if so, it doesn't work. it only checks port 8303
03:09 < Maimer> matricks you there?
05:41 < o0elise0o> i really like teeworlds, but it needs to more stuff
05:41 < o0elise0o> like doors, or at least triggers for map entities and stuff, moving tiles(platforms), etc
05:41 < o0elise0o> teleporters
05:45 < o0elise0o> levels are really limited in what they can do because of those missing things, ctf "bases" aren't possible for real, you just bottleneck people
05:45 < o0elise0o> the server doesn't offer much customization for like respawn time, item respawn times, etc. even the tuned stuff flags you as not vanilla
05:55 < o0elise0o> respawn times for items*
05:57 < o0elise0o> Is there anyone that can point me or help me to GIT the teeworlds repo and point me in the right direction on how to build on win64?
05:57 < o0elise0o> I guess I could possibly build on Mint 32bit
06:26 < o0elise0o> there's no repo?
06:45 < Maimer> o0elise0o there is a repo
06:52 < o0elise0o> Where?
06:53 < Maimer> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
07:07 < o0elise0o> Thanks
07:07 < o0elise0o> Is there anything special with the External Console protocol or is it just plain text?
07:22 < o0elise0o> What are the valid values for ec_output_level? I really just want to know what value to put to see the most verbose info.
07:23 < eeeee> iirc external console is just telnet
07:25 < eeeee> for the max verbosity you should specify ec_output_level 9001
07:25 < o0elise0o> It seems that way, yeah.
07:25 < o0elise0o> 9001? Really?
07:28 < o0elise0o> Is there a way to disable the EC timeout?
07:31 < eeeee> dunno, i used to just send ping commands
07:32 < o0elise0o> I wanted to make a real time logger with a trigger system
07:33 < eeeee> we used to have such a thing for ddwar
07:33 < o0elise0o> I'm just going to do it generic, using TCL
07:33 < o0elise0o> So it'll run on anything(even Android :-)
07:34 < eeeee> what
07:34 < o0elise0o> tcl/tk
07:35 < o0elise0o> its a language, theres an android ARM port
07:35 < eeeee> but why would logger even need a ui?
07:35 < eeeee> normally logger populates some kind of database
07:35 < o0elise0o> its not really a logger
07:35 < eeeee> which is then processed with some analytical logic and results are presented in the ui
07:35 < o0elise0o> more like an admin bot, with event triggers and stuff
07:35 < o0elise0o> but btw tcl doesnt have a UI
07:35 < o0elise0o> its a console mode language
07:36 < o0elise0o> um
07:36 < o0elise0o> there arent results
07:36 < eeeee> tk is the ui
07:36 < o0elise0o> yeah
07:36 < o0elise0o> but what im talking about isnt going to generate like a log file
07:37 < o0elise0o> more like an admin bot that notices when you've killed 5 people in a row but havent died and broadcasts "RAMPAGE!"
07:37 < o0elise0o> get what im saying?
07:37 < eeeee> anyway, you should try to decouple the actual "logger", that is the program which is console mode only and listens/responds to events
07:37 < eeeee> and the ui part
07:37 < eeeee> which would serve as a configuration utility for the first program
07:38 < o0elise0o> oh theres probably not going to be a configuration utility
07:38 < o0elise0o> just .cfg files
07:38 < o0elise0o> and there is no UI
07:38 < eeeee> oh, okay. carry on then
07:38 < eeeee> still, why tcl?
07:38 < o0elise0o> cuz i know it
07:38 < o0elise0o> :-P
07:39 < o0elise0o> also cuz then i can run the admin bot on my cellphone
07:39 < o0elise0o> but have the code be portable to every platform i know of that isn't made by Apple
07:39 < eeeee> pretty sure you can't
07:39 < eeeee> it would drain your battery in a couple hours
07:40 < o0elise0o> um
07:40 < eeeee> also you can likely run python or java on your phone as well
07:40 < o0elise0o> well when i say "cellphone" i mean palmtop PC
07:40 < o0elise0o> but thats ok
07:40 < eeeee> not to mention you can cross compile c++ with minimal effort to run on android
07:40 < o0elise0o> i don't know any of those languages
07:41 < eeeee> wow, okay
07:41 < o0elise0o> and tcl has a 1mb binary for all platforms, the overhead doesn't get much smaller. :-P
07:41 < eeeee> sounds like a perfect opportunity to learn them, then
07:41 < o0elise0o> i have no use for them
07:41 < o0elise0o> when/if i do i will learn them
07:42 < eeeee> you'll have no use for tcl after you learn them ;P
07:42 < o0elise0o> whys that
07:43 < eeeee> nobody really uses tcl so i strongly suspect it is an inferior language
07:43 < o0elise0o> i dont have root access on my VPS, i can't install things that need root like perl(which is already installed, but thats not hte pont)
07:43 < o0elise0o> tcl just isnt popular
07:44 < o0elise0o> i like it, the interpreter is one file, a small file, you can get precompiled binaries for every platform
07:44 < o0elise0o> seriously tcl has been ported to more platforms then most languages
08:33 <@matricks> Maimer: here bow
08:33 <@matricks> now
08:34 <@minus> here now, too o/
08:34 <@matricks> o0elise0o: btw, one of the design principles of teeworlds is simplicity, thats why you don't find loads of weapons etc in it
08:36 <@minus> matricks: but it lacks the rocket launcher from unreal tournament!
08:38 < o0elise0o> Oh I know it's simple, but moving platforms feel missing.
08:39 < o0elise0o> Really moving platforms is the only thing I listed that does actually feel missing.
08:40 < o0elise0o> well, that and being able to set the respawn timers for everything
08:42 < o0elise0o> Oh, and a tazer.
08:42 < o0elise0o> We need tasers so we can stun people.
08:42 <@minus> "only" :D
08:42 < o0elise0o> Just add moving tiles.
08:43 < o0elise0o> Have one of those 50 empty spots in the game entities file thing be a traintrack tile and you just set the speed it moves
08:43 < o0elise0o> or have a train layer. :-P
09:01 < o0elise0o> btw there is a bug in the external console
09:02 < o0elise0o> it's got garbage characters in the buffer when it asks for the password
09:02 < o0elise0o> so the first password try always fails
09:21 <@minus> sounds like a sensitive bug
10:20 < o0elise0o> It happens with every client I try to connect with, btw
10:21 <@matricks> o0elise0o: btw, why do you feel that moving platforms are missing?
10:22 < o0elise0o> It seems like it would expand the level design capabilities and make the game more fun, challenging, if implemented in a level a specific way it could make CTF bases more challenging to reach
10:22 < o0elise0o> also moving platforms seem like they fit the teeworlds style really well
10:23 < o0elise0o> In open air style maps moving blocks would add challenge to the game.
10:23 < o0elise0o> Your timings for hooks would change constantly, etc.
10:23 <@matricks> yes, and that goes against the teeworlds design :)
10:24 < o0elise0o> How so?
10:24 <@matricks> same reason why destructable terrain isn't done
10:24 < o0elise0o> I mean a level composed entirely of moving things would, but a moving platform in the middle region of the map sounds good to me.
10:25 <@matricks> teeworlds is about simplicity and predictability, the reason why people can move so fast in the game is because it's predictable
10:25 < o0elise0o> Horizontal movement I mean..
10:25 < o0elise0o> Yeah you can predict moving platforms on predestined tracks
10:25 < o0elise0o> Just like every mario game ever
10:26 <@matricks> one problem that I see with moving platforms is their velocity, you can't use them for moving a player, only creating changing obstacles
10:26 < o0elise0o> Why can't you move the player?
10:26 <@matricks> then the velocity of the platforms has to be very fast
10:27 < o0elise0o> Why?
10:27 <@matricks> why take a slow platform when you can fly fast through the air? same reason people don't walk in teeworlds
10:28 < o0elise0o> ..
10:28 < o0elise0o> Well, I didn't mean for you to use them to take a ride.
10:28 <@matricks> if teeworlds were more slow paced, moving platforms would make more sense
10:28 < o0elise0o> That's a bit odd and I hadn't thought of people doing that.
10:28 < o0elise0o> ..
10:28 < o0elise0o> haha
10:28 < o0elise0o> I guess you don't get it.
10:29 < o0elise0o> Oh well.
10:29 <@matricks> and I guess you don't get teeworlds :)
10:29 < o0elise0o> Teeworlds hasn't changed in 5 years so I'm not expecting anything new to be added ever anyways.
10:30 <@matricks> is that bad? tetris hasn't changed in.. well.. I don't know how many years :)
10:30 < o0elise0o> A moving platform in the middle area of a CTF map. It's just a moving hookable object, not a train to ride..
10:30 < o0elise0o> Um.
10:30 < o0elise0o> Tetris has changed a lot.
10:31 < o0elise0o> When was the last time you played an official Tetris game?
10:31 <@matricks> never, I play the classic ones :)
10:31 < o0elise0o> Video games that don't change get left behind, btw.
10:31 <@matricks> the thing is, let teeworlds be teeworlds, if you wanna do something else, I would do teeworlds2 or something like that
10:31 <@matricks> o0elise0o: is that a bad thing?
10:32 <@matricks> o0elise0o: games that change all the time doesn't nesessarly get better, they get bland
10:32 <@matricks> why do people thing a game dieing off is a bad thing...
10:33 <@matricks> do a new game with the updated changes you want etc instead of patching away a perfectly good game that it is
10:33 <@matricks> so people can go back and replay that old game that they liked
10:34 < o0elise0o> So basically the forum post for "hey what do you want to see in 0.7" is just bullshit?
10:34 < o0elise0o> You're saying not one dev is going to care what anyone says there?
10:35 <@matricks> I've not read it
10:35 < o0elise0o> Are you even a dev?
10:35 <@matricks> :)
10:35 <@matricks> well, not anymore
10:36 < o0elise0o> Why cuz you don't understand that an active project means an unfinished one? Or what?
10:37 <@matricks> because I got tired more or less, and had little spare time
10:37 < o0elise0o> Teeworlds hasn't even made it to 1.0 yet. Pfft, not even a traditionally non-beta release.
10:38 <@matricks> well, you have to define 1.0 to make it into 1.0
10:38 < o0elise0o> Moving platforms if done with care in the level design part could easily be easy to play and add to the speed of a level.
10:39 < o0elise0o> Teleporters, if not abused by mappers, can do the same
10:39 <@matricks> teleporters is a better fit
10:39 < o0elise0o> Doors, or just triggered moving/disappearing/appearing tiles, would most definitely add some traditional tactics to matched like CTF
10:40 <@matricks> what you want is more dynamic maps it seems
10:41 < o0elise0o> Sort of.
10:41 <@matricks> which is one of the things I stayed away from when designing the game
10:41 < o0elise0o> I want CTF to be able to even have traditional CTF tactics involved in the game
10:41 < o0elise0o> Right now the only way to really do a CTF base is to have the flag be off on a platform far off to the side with one path in
10:41 < o0elise0o> Cuz theres zero obstacle capabilities
10:42 < o0elise0o> if you had to hook/jump even one moving platform on the way into the base and the distances where right you'd create a better base
10:42 <@matricks> which game do you refer to when you say traditional ctf?
10:43 < o0elise0o> you'd add a moment of pause to recover a defense, etc
10:43 < o0elise0o> They are all the same..
10:43 <@matricks> *games
10:43 < o0elise0o> take ctf5 for example
10:43 <@matricks> well, when I think traditional ctf were I drew inspiration from when I designed teeworlds it's quake3
10:44 < o0elise0o> I'll admit that is a really well done map, but it's old and really really over played
10:44 <@matricks> and there you have no buttons, teleporters or moving platforms etc etc
10:44 < o0elise0o> But any other map to capture the gameplay would have to be a clone of ctf5
10:44 < o0elise0o> q3 doesn't have teleporters?
10:45 < o0elise0o> i know it has bouncy bouncers
10:45 < o0elise0o> whatever they are called. :-P
10:45 <@matricks> it has, but not on any of the ctf maps I think
10:45 < o0elise0o> maybe add bouncy bouncers to teeworlds
10:45 <@matricks> or well, one ctf map has teleporters and moving platform, the ctf map that sucks :)
10:45 < o0elise0o> oh and hey
10:45 < o0elise0o> what i was thinking the teleports would be good for was for spawn rooms you can't get massacred in
10:45 < o0elise0o> one way teleports out of hte spawn room
10:46 < o0elise0o> or maybe even just one way blocks in vanilla teeworlds
10:47 < o0elise0o> one way blocks that you cant shoot through but can move in a specific direction through
10:47 <@matricks> stuff like that is better
10:47 <@matricks> it fits more into the design
10:48 < o0elise0o> im a huge CTF fan btw, I played quake1, quake3, unreal tourny, urban terror, etc
10:48 < o0elise0o> i also like making teeworlds maps
10:48 <@matricks> I played q3 ctf every day before.. same map everyday :)
10:48 <@matricks> q3ctf3
10:49 < o0elise0o> if you want to see a map i made just join elise.openverse.com in teeworlds.
10:49 <@matricks> can't
10:49 <@matricks> workin
10:49 < o0elise0o> i host a dedicated teeworlds server on my vps, which btw kind of sucks the server lags on kind of a cycle
10:51 <@matricks> btw, I'm not a dev anymore, but it's me who designed and coded almost everything in teeworlds form the beginning before I handed it over to Oy
10:54 < o0elise0o> Well thanks for the game.
10:55 <@matricks> I take no part of development of the game what so ever now adays, I've done some smaller fixes etc but thats about it
10:56 <@matricks> and now I shall fix food, and then work some
11:17 < o0elise0o> Is there any logic to the item=1/0 etc stuff in the server logs?
11:21 <@matricks> dunno, don't recall
11:21 <@matricks> there is logic to it yes :)
11:21 <@matricks> but I can't remember what logic

19:49 < nameless_tee> found it thx
19:57 < nameless_tee> its a pain to play this game on fedora, besides the missing packages to even start the game which i found after inet forum search, the srv is just not working (autoexe missing it seems + other stuff). also the fullscreen mode offers extreme stutters and unability to do anything other before quit.
19:58 < nameless_tee> ubuntu worked better afaik when i tried about a year ago, beside that it crashed from time to time which is inacceptable too.
19:59 < nameless_tee> you know a distribution where this game is working correctlyẞ

20:22 < heinrich5991> what graphics card do you have, what driver do you use?
20:22 < heinrich5991> for me, it ran smoothly on ubuntu, without crashes

20:44 < BotoX> or intel did, or even AMD

20:49 < BotoX> y-yeah guys
20:49 < BotoX> we're working on it!
20:51 < BotoX> The displayport is only enabled when using the discrete AMD card, they're using a hardware mux.
20:51 < BotoX> So I guess the intel chipset isn't at fault but AMD?
20:51 < BotoX> Or the chipset doesn't give the GPU any audio?
20:52 <@minus> GPU needs no fuckin audio support for audio on DP, it just has to mux in a stream. can't be so hard. or if it really is any more complicated it's shit
20:55 <@minus> good bang for the buck http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00DMRJKLI/
20:55 < BotoX> >numpad on a laptop
20:55 < BotoX> and I hate flat chiclet keys
20:55 <@minus> well, it's 15.6"
20:55 < BotoX> Mine's too.
20:55 < BotoX> No numpad :3
20:55 <@minus> a numpad is normal on those
20:55 < BotoX> My desktop keyboard doesn't have one either.
20:56 <@minus> extra keys to remap :3
20:56 < BotoX> and oh man these awful arrow keys.

20:57 < BotoX> >Audio over DisplayPort when used in conjunction with a DisplayPort to HDMI conversion cable is confirmed to work on W500, T410 and T510 both on integrated and discrete graphics options on Windows systems. 
20:57 < BotoX> what?
20:58 <@matricks> display port has support for audio...
20:58 < BotoX> not on this laptop imo
20:59 < BotoX> or the PM44 chipset, blame whoever fucked it up - or disabled it
