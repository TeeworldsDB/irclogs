07:22 < JesseH2> My internet messed up after I sent those messages.
07:22 < JesseH2> Trying with 0.6.1 now.
07:23 < JesseH2> Ah, so it happens with 0.6.1 as well.
07:23 < JesseH2> I have no idea how to troubleshoot this sort of issue. Can someone help me out?
07:33 < JesseH2> It's happening with 0.6.0 as well.
07:48 <@matricks> sent what messages?
08:25 < JesseH2> matricks, <JesseH> Hi, I was wondering if someone could assist me in troubleshooting an issue. I don't get this with other applications; I only get it with teeworlds. Every minute or so, I get about 10-15 seconds of a sort of low-fps, lag. My ping isn't affected.
08:25 < JesseH2> <JesseH> It does this with the most current official teeworlds client, and the DDNet client. Let me try an older version of teeworlds to see if it's still the case there.
08:32 <@matricks> strange
08:32 <@matricks> check if some other process is spiking during that time
13:21 < SideTrack> hi
13:22  * SideTrack slaps matricks around a bit with a large fishbot
13:22 <@matricks> ?
13:22 < SideTrack> lol hi
13:23 < SideTrack> sigh
13:24  * SideTrack slaps matricks around a bit with a large fishbot
13:24 < SideTrack> well gtg see later
13:41 < Fels> oink
13:42 <@matricks> pig
13:42 < Fels> and? let me be a pig

13:44 <@matricks> NO!
13:45 < Fels> KWAAAK
13:45 <@matricks> duck!
13:45 < Fels> what is, 1+2*3 :>
13:45 <@matricks> same as 2 3 * 1 +
13:46 < Fels> is this a déjà vú ?
13:47 <@minus> i was thinking the same
13:47 < Savander> yea, me too.
13:47 < Savander> 7
13:47 < Savander> :PP
13:47 < Fels> the time is stuck
13:48 < Savander> now we should just start talking about
13:48 < Savander> TeeVee
13:48 < Savander> and big tournament in TeeWorlds
13:48 < Savander> btw, tee.ve is free
13:48 < Savander> http://teev.ee/ *
13:49 < Savander> i mean..:/
13:49 < Fels> tee.tv <.<
13:50 < Savander> :D
17:26 < JesseH> matricks, I didn't see anything out of the norm with my processes.
19:33 < day_> teeworlds had this strange compiling dependency. I think  matricks wrote it specifically for teeworlds. was it removed? completely forgot the name :/
19:33 < day_> i think it was written in lua. but i might be wrong
19:34 < Savander> bam?
19:34 < day_> could be :/
19:35 < Henningstone_> bam is not a compiling dependency, it is the build system. But it actually uses Lua for it's makefiles
19:35 < day_> i only remember that there always was something annoying about the compile process
19:35 < day_> yea i think thats it then
19:35 < Henningstone_> that is not annoying, it is so easy
19:35 < day_> but it seems to be still in there
19:35 < day_> its just that i slackbuild compiled the source code yesterday, and it just worked 
19:36 < Henningstone_> of cause is there anymore, and it is not annoying. you just type 'bam' and you are done what is annoying there?
19:36 < day_> the bam thing seems to be part of the tw source code though if i see it right
19:36 < Henningstone_> no 
19:36 < day_> hm. maybe i was lacking lua in my attempts years ago
19:36 < day_> hm
19:37 < Henningstone_> ok wait, you are missunderstanding. I explain.
19:37 < day_> i mean that bam already is in the github tw rep
19:37 < day_> its NOT part of tw itself
19:37 < Henningstone_> no, only the makefile is part of the repo
19:38 < Henningstone_> you have to download (and compile) bam yourself
19:38 < Savander> https://github.com/matricks/bam/
19:38 < day_> but i do not have bam on my system, yet i was able to compile teeworlds ;/
19:38 < Savander> huh?
19:38 < Henningstone_> that cannot be true. seriously not.
19:38 < day_> thats what struck me as odd ^^
19:39 < Henningstone_> did you do it with a fresh repo?
19:40 < Henningstone_> wtf
19:40 < Henningstone_> oh damn, closed the wrong process
19:40 < day_> bam should be in /bin/ right?
19:40 < day_> or at least my terminal should know it
19:40 < day_> which it doesnt, ergo it is not there
19:41 < Savander> Henningstone, : "/usr/local/bin/
19:41 < Henningstone> yeah Savander, thats right
19:41 < Savander> ye, i copied it from ddnet :P
19:41 < day_> Savander: nothing in there
19:41 < Savander> put bam there
19:41 < Savander> or
19:41 < day_> i never installed it, and i doubt its part of a vanilla slackware :D
19:41 < Henningstone> day_ if you copy the bam executable to there you can run it globally
19:41 < Savander> or use absolute path
19:41 < Savander> to bam
19:42 < day_> Savander: apparently i can compile tw without bam 
19:42 < Savander> Huh?
19:42 < day_> yeah :P thats what im thinking as well
19:42 < Henningstone> that cannot be true, again
19:42 < Savander> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/0.6/bam.lua
19:43 < Savander> as far as i know, it implemetns a lot of stuff
19:43 < day_> http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/games/teeworlds/
19:43 < Henningstone> again, it is the Makefile!! it tells bam what to do!
19:43 < day_> Henningstone: but there is no bam on my system
19:43 < Savander> day_,  i sent a link
19:43 < Savander> https://github.com/matricks/bam/
19:43 < Savander> download it, and compile it
19:44 < Savander> it'll make a "bam" file
19:44 < Savander> for you
19:44 < Savander> then copy it to  "/usr/local/bin/"
19:44 < Savander> and then in sources of tw
19:44 < Henningstone> day_: then, pls tell me how you compiled it? what command did you type?
19:44 < Savander> execute it
19:44 < day_> i didnt write the slackbuild script :/
19:44 < day_> but theres no mentioning of bam in there
19:45 < Savander> http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/games/teeworlds/ 
19:45 < Savander> its compiled game.
19:45 < Savander> not source 
19:45 < day_> :x
19:45 < day_> ohw gawd :D
19:45 < Henningstone> day_: what do you think means "compiling" then? xD
19:46 < day_> i was already amazed by the speed of my ram drive
19:46 < day_> lol
19:46 < Savander> huh?
19:46 < day_> well it 'compiled' in less than a second :P
19:46 < Savander> 285 players on Teeworlds Via steam
19:46 < Savander> good score
19:47 < Savander> First day :D
19:47 < Savander> don't understand
19:47 < Henningstone> release today?!
19:47 < Savander> Henningstone,  yes
19:47 < Savander> :P
19:47 < Savander> on steam, yes
19:47 < Savander> https://steamdb.info/app/380840/
19:47 < Henningstone> lol i'm not up to date about this ^^
19:47 < Savander> here you have more statistics
19:47 < Savander> ;p
19:47 <@minus> 989 players, 990 servers :D
19:48 < Savander> :D
19:48 < Savander> on vanilla
19:48 < Savander> over 300 players
19:48 < Henningstone> nice, every player has it's own server ^^
19:48 < Savander> but, i don't like that teeworlds has forced some filters..
19:48 < Savander> ;/
19:48 < Henningstone> mods are dangerous, you know... :3
19:49 < Savander> mods make this game still alive :D
19:49 < day_> filters?
19:49 < Savander> yes
19:49 < Savander> "Show only Standard gametypes"
19:49 < Henningstone> Savander: that was sarcasm :/
19:49 < Savander> "Show only standard maps"
19:50 < day_> you mean on first startup?
19:50 < Savander> yes
19:50 < day_> i find the stupid music much more annoying
19:50 < day_> whose idea was that crap
19:50 < Savander> :PP.
19:50 < day_> it was removed for a reason
19:50 < Henningstone> its teeish!
19:50 < Savander> Definitly!!
19:50 < day_> its the first thing everyone turns off
19:50 < day_> unless they bleed to death before they find the button...
19:51 < Savander> ;c
19:51 < day_> so what if valve adds this game?
19:51 < Henningstone> ? 
19:51 < Savander> Valve added this game?
19:51 < Henningstone> it is added
19:51 < day_> i heard about the steam implementation. NDA signing blablabla
19:51 < Savander> it's already on steam
19:51 < Savander> lol
19:52 < day_> closed source etc.
19:52 < Savander> no
19:52 < day_> how was this solved?
19:52 < Savander> teeworlds is still open source
19:52 < Savander> and don't have anything from steam
19:52 < Savander> only distribution.
19:52 < Savander> (and statistics)
19:53 < Henningstone> and tw will ever stay os!! and if not then in ya face!
19:53 < day_> would be great to see new players
19:53 < day_> even though its gonna take a few years before they are decent lol
19:53 < Savander> there is!
19:53 < Savander> https://steamdb.info/app/380840
19:54 < Savander> from 100 players on vanilla
19:54 < Savander> increased to 300 on vanilla
19:54 < Savander> in few hours?
19:54 < Savander> i think it's big step
19:54 < Savander> teeworlds was alive and will be
19:54 < Savander> :PP
19:54 < Savander> even without steam, but now.. more players :D
19:54 < LittleWhite> Savander: Well done
19:54 < day_> problem is the vanilla skill ceiling is crazy :/
19:55 < Henningstone> OH ONE THING TO SAY: There are 16x more positive reviews than negative ones :)
19:55 < Henningstone> is fact, there is ony one negative i can see
19:55 < Henningstone> but it says that there might be anotherone lol :0
19:56 < Savander> I think, new players now have good start
19:57 < Henningstone> oh, I saw these system requirements last time >10 jears ago: Memory: 512 MB RAM, Hard Drive: 10 MB available space
19:57 < Savander> because a lot of new started too
19:57 < Savander> ;d
19:57 < Savander> hjahaha
19:57 < Savander> D:D:
19:57 < Savander> i think
19:57 < Savander> wait
19:59 <@minus> wow, teeworlds needs a whopping 93M RAM
20:00 < Henningstone> i guess valve doesn't know such small numbers... :/ ^^
20:00 < Savander> :D
20:07 < heinrich5991> Henningstone: those are completely made up
20:08 < heinrich5991> I just took them from some game and adapted them so it looked fine :)
20:09 < Henningstone> ah ok :) half a gigabyte seems so overdue for teeworlds :D
20:10 < heinrich5991> I don't understand. too little or too much?
20:10 < Henningstone> overdue = übertrieben, so way to much ;)
20:11 < heinrich5991> haha ok

21:03 < Fels> wub wubwub
21:07 < LittleWhite> I hope the popularity increase will not cause problems
21:07 < Savander> LittleWhite, probablly will
21:07 < Henningstone> how should it?
21:07 < Savander> more players
21:07 < Savander> more fuckers
21:08 < LittleWhite> Like hackers ... 
21:08 < Savander> more attacks
21:08 < Henningstone> oh like this...
21:08 < Fels> http://store.steampowered.com/app/380840/
21:08 < Fels> !!!!!!
21:08 < LittleWhite> sorry, not hackers ... lamers and script kiddie
21:08 < Savander> Fels,  wow :D
21:08 < Henningstone> 0.7 will fix so much :)
21:08 < LittleWhite> No achievements :'(
21:08 < Henningstone> but the fckn little suckers are indeed a problem. steam has so much of them :(
21:14 < Savander> 420 players
21:14 < Savander> on steam
21:14 < Savander> :D
21:14 < Savander> (currentlY)
21:15 < Fels> http://steamcharts.com/app/380840
21:15 < Henningstone> peak
21:15 < Savander> https://steamdb.info/app/380840/graphs/
21:15 < Savander> :P
21:15 <@minus> 1087 players on teeworlds
21:16 < Savander> :>
21:16 < Henningstone> i guess half of the offline players switched to steam :/
21:16 < Savander> ?
21:16 < Savander> meaybe
21:16 < Henningstone> so this number is a bit fakey
21:16 < Savander> but it's good
21:16 < Savander> not really.
21:16 < Henningstone> i mean if we want to know the number of new players
21:16 < Henningstone> farmed by steamrelease
21:19 < Savander> we don't need :D
21:19 < Savander> :PP
21:20 < Henningstone> if we assume that farming new players is the main purpose of tw-steamrelease? hm.
21:22 < Fels> well..teeworlds is a player-driven-game.. no players = no teeworlds 
21:25 < Fels> and there are great mods by the community.. so.. if tw gets more players, the development activity will increase = more cool gametypes and mods in a shorter time
21:26 < Henningstone> mmh some people are not really convinced about mods and 'd have no problem with dropping all mod compatibilities :3
21:26 < Henningstone> Althought mods keeping tw alive imo
21:26 < Fels> mods keep every game alive
21:26 < Fels> there are games that wouldnt exist without mods
21:27 < Fels> and games that wouldnt be played, without mod-support
21:28 < Fels> but.. this could also go into the wrong direction.. when people start to use their modding abilities against the community. 
21:28 < Henningstone> Pff this is funny too, sometimes if you do not harm anybody ^^ ;D
21:28 < Henningstone> But the importance of mods is what I'm aiming at. I think teeworlds would not have half much players without mods
21:30 < Fels> mods mean = the game is getting developed by the players itself. ofcourse people like that
21:31 < Henningstone> and then, there are these games which should be closed source, but people are so adicted to modding that they somehow get the sourcecode xD
21:32 < Henningstone> but everybody who writes a game in java risk that. meh
21:33 < Fels> the question is always.. how far do you let people edit your game code. too much = people could destroy everything. too less = people wouldnt be able to do fancy mods.
21:35 <@matricks> LittleWhite: hopefully, never achievements
21:36 < Henningstone> they require the steam api right? and that should not be publicized right?
21:36 <@matricks> yeah
21:36 <@matricks> thats my guess atleast
21:36 < jxsl13> I'd like some kind of small ingame tutorial for movement for the beginners and a lil bit of gameplay
21:36 < Fels> yea, tw is pretty hardcore for new players
21:37 < Henningstone> matricks: I've heared that if you implement the Steam API, they force you to go closed source since they do not want their code to be published
21:37 < jxsl13> vanilla is too complicated, even for me x)
21:37 <@matricks> more or less
21:37 < Henningstone> and if you publish it anyway, you'll be punished... but not sure, dunno where I read this
21:37 <@matricks> I think it's bad enough that teeworlds is on steam, but thats me
21:38 < Fels> i mean.. the player count didnt really drop.. didnt it?
21:38 < Fels> in the past few years?
21:38 < Henningstone> but it didn't raise either
21:38 < jxsl13> from 10k to 1 k
21:38 < jxsl13> well
21:38 <@matricks> ...
21:39 < jxsl13> maybe 10k is too much
21:39 < jxsl13> but it were more players in my opinion
21:39 <@matricks> teeworlds never had 10k
21:39 < Fels> yea
21:39 <@matricks> topped at around 1.5k or something
21:40 < Fels> as i said.. the playercount is pretty solid
21:40 < Henningstone> 10k sounds a bit overdue :D would have needed 625 vanilla servers, all 16p
21:48 < Fels> oink
21:48 < Henningstone> gleichfalls
21:48 < Fels> english 
21:48 < Fels> pls
21:48 < Henningstone> was just a joke ;)
