20:14 < day> Dune_: online?
20:14 <@Dune_> yes
20:15 < day> nice. you on archlinux atm?
20:15 <@Dune_> no
20:15 < day> im still having trouble running tw on arch/i3. my cursor instantly freezes in the upper left corner, when i move it the first time after starting the game
20:16 < day> any idea what might be causing that?
20:16 <@Dune> do you have a 4k screen?
20:19 <@Dune> also, can you try with inp_grab 1 in f1 console, day?
20:19 < day> no just two 1080p screens. looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/I1pvkws.png
20:19 <@Dune> hm, I have the same config
20:19 < day> the black bars are 'dead space' outside of monitors
20:20 <@Dune> please try inp_grab 1. have you tried to switch on and off gfx_fullscreen as well?
20:21 < day> lul i just found the solution by accident
20:22 < day> inp_grab 1
20:22 <@Dune> if you set it back to 0, the problem occurs?
20:22 < day> yeah
20:23 <@Dune> Wanna report that at https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues ?
20:23 <@Dune> I can do it, otherwise
20:23 < day> sure i can
20:23 < day> maybe you want to test it on your system first though. if its unique to me it might not be worse investigating?
20:23 <@Dune> no, it's not a unique problem, but I thought it was fixed
20:24 <@Dune> I never had that problem but I run ubuntu 16.04
20:28 < day> Dune: wait you mentioned inp_grab 1. i didnt read it :P
20:37 <@Dune> twice :P
20:38 < day> is it normal that i cant uncheck the 'standard gametype' flag in the search filter?
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Mice> No
22:01 <@Dune> day, probably is, if you're in the "Teeworlds" filter
22:04 < day> ah. i was used to the old filter. i didnt see i can add new 'virtual folders'
22:05 <@Dune> yeah. you can also modify "All" afaik
22:14 < day> dont really need it, i only play vanilla anyways. although im a bit confused why LMS is now vanilla :P
22:14 <@Dune> Because it's a new gametypes, alongside with LTS :)
22:16 < day> i figured, im just confused why. never seen it being played as a mod. i remember freeze
22:17 <@Dune> I think that's different?
22:17 < day> yeah. you can be defreezed
22:17 <@Dune> and I think it was a mod called SUR in 0.6
22:17 < day> get*
22:17 <@Dune> there is no freeze things in LMS
22:17 < day> i know
22:18 < day> i would have promoted the most famous mod to vanilla status, not create something brand spanking new and call it vanilla
22:19 <@Dune> well, mods that fit teeworlds get incorporated in the basic game
22:19 <@Dune> I think survival fits pretty well and is easy to implement, probably why it was made first
22:20 < day> as long as you dont promote ddrace...
22:20 <@Dune> if ddrace was somehow made in a teeish way, why not. it's hard though, not really the vanilla mechanics
22:21 <@Dune> it's not as easy as just moving modifications code into teeworlds though, it has to be well integrated in client ^^
22:21 < day> time to promote iCTF then :p
22:22 <@Dune> that one is super controversial
22:22 < day> i know :D
22:23 <@Dune> I personally would enjoy that, but I don't really mind much, because in the end instagib doesn't benefit that much from official integration, does it?
22:24 < day> well it's a technically anyways. no one cares if it's in the 'standard gametype' section or not.
22:24 <@Dune> well with some gametypes like race it's a big deal because you get client-sided features and what not right
22:25 <@Dune> but yeah I agree with you
22:25 <@Dune> it feels like a technicality for ictf
22:25 < day> if you put too much into it, it wont help newbs because there would be too many gametypes to choose from
22:25 <@Dune> not everyone agrees though. that decision was made long ago, and I didn't follow teeworlds back then, so I don't really know all the arguments ^^ maybe you know better
22:25 <@Dune> maybe
