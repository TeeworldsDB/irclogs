12:26 < Dune> Usage: wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...
12:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Any reason Player configs are not prefixed with cl? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/variables.h#L60
12:32 < Dune> being nice with compatibility? :p
12:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> comaptible to what?
12:42 < Dune> other versions of teeworlds
12:42 < Dune> guides etc.
12:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hmm k
12:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so it has always been like that so it wont be changed?
12:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i see
12:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> guess then i stay compatible as well
12:51 < Dune> don't break what isn't broken :p
13:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Well i break compability to ddnet if i dont use cl
13:21 < Dune> well then /shrug
21:20 < kma> blargh
21:43 < Dune_> bleh
21:47 < Dune_> matricks: hey, do you know of security issues why it would be unfit to load untrusted png's in pnglite?
22:18 < minus> that's kind of a silly question
22:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> please minus, do enlighten us
22:29 < minus> it's a relatively widely used png library. if the latest version had some long-known security issues it wouldn't be used at all
22:29 < minus> tho can check changelog and CVEs
22:29 < minus> oh
22:29 < minus> last update 2013?
22:29 < minus> yeah i guess i wouldn't use it
22:30 < minus> likely has some serious vulns
22:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Well that answers it :D thx
22:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I was asking mtx because he said he would switch away at some point in the past :)
22:31 < minus> oh lol it's even heinrich5991 who maintains the AUR package
22:31 < minus> yeah just use libpng
22:31 < minus> i guess
22:32 < minus> % y -Qi libpng | grep -i size
22:32 < minus> Installed Size  : 572.00 KiB
22:32 < minus> that's not too bad
23:23 < matricks> minus: there is kinda of an intressting observation been done with code
23:23 < matricks> minus: people tend to not trust code that havn't been touched in a long while and itsn't activly pushed forward
23:24 < matricks> that code might however be the most tested and well understood code
23:24 < matricks> minus: not saying that is the case always but
23:25 < matricks> like, something that is 3 years old with no updates, would you trust it? :)
23:26 < minus> if no one uses it, no one will find bugs and look for vulns
23:27 < matricks> used and updated is two different things :)
23:27 < minus> but yeah, haveing no changes isn't a bad thing per se
23:27 < matricks> like zlib, last update is jan 2017 :)
23:27 < matricks> almost 3 years
23:28 < minus> yeah, but zlib is very widely used in contrast
23:28 < matricks> that tech is however quite old
23:29 < minus> http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html damn that's a lot of warnings
23:30 < matricks> yeah I was looking at that as well
23:30 < matricks> might as well just put a sign saying, "For the love of god, please use the latest version"
23:30 < minus> :D
23:30 < minus> RiiR
23:31 < minus> if rust was only as widely compatible as c
23:52 < matricks> I've had a funny problem lately
23:52 < matricks> something was sucking up my drive space for some reason, couldn't find it
23:52 < matricks> found it today
23:52 < matricks> ~/.xession-errors....
23:53 < matricks> that file was 200gb :D
23:53 < matricks> space well spent!
