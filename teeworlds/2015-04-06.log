11:52 < lekc> heya
11:53 < lekc> anyone around?
11:53 < LittleWhite> Hey
11:54 < lekc> im trying to setup a server
11:54 < lekc> but i'm getting timeouts only on my server
11:55 < LittleWhite> firewall ?
11:55 < LittleWhite> DNS ?
11:55 < lekc> that is, i connect play a bit 
11:55 < lekc> and then randomly timeout
11:55 < lekc> if it was a firewall issue would i be able to connect and play?
11:56 < lekc> afaik there is not closed ports and i have permitted the teeworlds_srv.exe from the firewall
11:56 < LittleWhite> Did you check the log (from client and server)
11:56 < lekc> yeah
11:56 < lekc> [client] disconnecting reason = unknown
11:56 < lekc> offline error = timeout
11:58 < lekc> [server] client dropped. cid=0 addr=xxx reason='Timeout
12:01 < lekc> [55225882][register]: no firewall/nat problems detected
12:01 < lekc> [55225882][register]: no firewall/nat problems detected
12:04 < lekc> anything?
12:06 < heinrich5991> is it a local server?
12:06 < lekc> no
12:09 < heinrich5991> mh.
12:09 < heinrich5991> do you know if others are getting disconnected as well?
12:10 < lekc> i don't have anyone else to test
12:10 < lekc> you wanna try?
12:13 < LittleWhite> Is your server is accessible from Internet ?
12:13 < lekc> yeah
12:13 < lekc> i connect from another machine not LAN
12:13 < lekc> but get timeouts
12:13 < lekc> randomly
12:14 < LittleWhite> Ok
12:14 < LittleWhite> I can check
12:14 < lekc> ok i'll pm you ip:port
12:16 < LittleWhite> I see
12:16 < LittleWhite> I think it's related to the server
12:17 < lekc> did you also?
12:17 < lekc> hm
12:17 < LittleWhite> since, I got timeouted
12:17 < lekc> okay i'll look into it then 
12:17 < LittleWhite> Maybe a port is not open ?
12:17 < LittleWhite> the one related to alive checking
12:18 < lekc> hmm
12:18 < LittleWhite> (can't remember the correct name)
12:18 < lekc> there are not any closed ports
12:18 < LittleWhite> working like a watchdog
12:18 < lekc> only a firewalla that allows/disallows connections
12:18 < lekc> is it a different process than the server or service/
12:19 < LittleWhite> no
12:19 < LittleWhite> but can be a different port
12:19 < heinrich5991> I don't think there's such a different port
12:19 < LittleWhite> ah
12:20 < heinrich5991> I'm not aware of any modification that does this
12:20 < lekc> i created an outbound rule lets see
12:20 < lekc> i already had an inbound
12:23 < lekc> yeah seems that was the issue
12:23 < lekc> i wasnt allowing to connect to the player
12:24 < lekc> noo timeout again
12:32 < lekc> ok so i tried w/o firewall (disabled it) and still the same, i'm pretty sure it's not a port issue as i run lots of services w/o ever opening up a port on this machine
