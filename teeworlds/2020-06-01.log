20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, this is correct, ZillyHuhn
20:23 < ZillyHuhn> bit 
20:23 < ZillyHuhn> much 
20:23 < ZillyHuhn> guess its to support the weird format
20:24 < ZillyHuhn> what is the advantage of bytes be over just storing it as a int?
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> theoretically, int is a bad idea because different machines order the bytes in a int differently
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness
20:29 < ZillyHuhn> ah ok
20:29 < ZillyHuhn> what is different here? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1591036173.png
20:30 < ZillyHuhn> oh wait wrong 
20:30 < ZillyHuhn> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1591036233.png
20:31 < ZillyHuhn> ah ok its differnt nvm im confusd af
20:35 < ZillyHuhn> wait but @heinrich5991 64 can be stored in one byte already how is that affected by endianess?
20:35 < ZillyHuhn> or is that a useless optimization?
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think it's just that it used to be an integer and people did not want to change the format
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (?)
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but it could definitely be stored in just one byte
