03:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <1stDecadeTW> @ChillerDragon  I like your "z7" bot in your CTF 5 server, I thought it was a new player in the game, it's a good idea for training new players but it falls down a lot... It would be possible to add more options? Like: add new bot to red/blue team, remove bot...Increase the difficulty or add different classes of bots with certain behavior?
10:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ah donâ€™t leak my bot Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s illegal xd
10:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @1stDecadeTW this bot has zero brain and is almost completely blind xd. Im currently too noob to not make him fall down.
10:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Itâ€™s just there to play with nameless tees and disconnects when more than 3 humans are online.
10:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh and regarding options @1stDecadeTW you can write !disconnect in chat to make him leave. And in case more commands like team switch are coming those will be listed in !help or !cmdlist
13:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Hey, is oy there?
13:54 < Dune> no, you can use https://webchat.quakenet.org if you want to check irc
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Okay, anyways, can someone help with the buffer overload problem for rainbow? since i need to send a skinchange every tick - to every player - it will at some point crash the server
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if too many tees have rainbow
14:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i checked which packets arrive at the client, at there is nothing weird happening, no unwanted other packets
14:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so its kinda weird that it overloads already at ~7 players with rainbow at a time
14:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @fokkonaut can you give us a link to your server code?
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it is private, due to stealing attempts by @jason54 | BlackPast
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I can give you access tho, or show the rainbow part
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah either is fine
14:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://pastebin.com/raw/Bj66p8fW
14:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I just send this in the `CPlayer::Snap`
14:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Each tick, to each client individually
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if I'd sent it in `Tick()` and send it to `-1`, it would overload even faster. I could of course make a loop inside of the Tick function, but Snap is a loop already
14:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> what do you mean by overload?
14:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> The buffer overloads
14:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> what exactly happens?
14:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> mostly it crashes the server and/or disconnects players for Error sending data
14:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> do you know how to use a debugger?
14:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> not really, my server runs on linux
14:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> there are debuggers for linux
14:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> attach one, force the server to crash when built on debug mode
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and look at the trace
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I tried to run the server with gdb
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but that didnt work out well, didnt get a BT
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> well I suggest you try again, maybe we can help you with that
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> maybe you built release mode? aka without debugging info
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no, debug was true in f23
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no, debug was true in f2
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> huh, I don't think that's the same debug
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it is debug mode on
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well, it is automatcially true if built in debug mode
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> oh, okay. didn't know
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and: i had dbg_dummies
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> they are only in debug build
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> still, make sure there is a `-g` somewhere when you compile teeworlds
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> huh
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..`
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i used this
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> then make, then used the binary
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't know what cmake does and whether it adds -g
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> would be nice to make sure with verbose :)
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> try gdb again, let's see what it tells you
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you said you couldn't get a backtrace?
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it was just empty, if i remember correctly
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune what do you mean with -g?
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> a compiler flag
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> where do i need to add that?
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> idk cmake
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> check that it adds it when it compiles
14:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> huh
14:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it probably does
14:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> open your generated Makefile, check if there are any -g
14:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> make VERBOSE=1 on cmake iirc
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> no, there are'nt any or no you won't? ðŸ˜„
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> there is not -g in that file
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune where? D:
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> compile with this command
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `make VERBOSE=1 |grep \-g` something like that :p
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what does the `debug` command in f2 does?
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what does the `debug` command in f2 do?
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> enable some debug-only routines in teeworlds iirc
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> grep: invalid option -- 'g'
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Try 'grep --help' for more information.
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> have no idea, sorry :/
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> pastebin your makefile please @fokkonaut
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i have two build folders, you mean the debug one?
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yes
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://pastebin.com/raw/dww6THYN
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> isn't there another one?
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nop
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> A Makefile2 perhaps?
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its in build/CmakeFiles/
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea, there is a makefil2
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> alright give me that one
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://pastebin.com/raw/puu0fWGd
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I don't see any compiler flag in that one either
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> mh
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> but anyway, cmake *should* add the proper flags by default
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> just run gdb again
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> how does that work again? :p
14:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> https://cs.baylor.edu/~donahoo/tools/gdb/tutorial.html
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `gdb -ex run -ex bt --args ./yourserver -f autoexec.cfg`
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> lol
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> got a bt
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> juste `make VERBOSE=1`, you'll see the g++ command
14:55 < redix> ever thought about the possibility that the buffer really overloads?
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> LOL
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `pPlayerInfo->m_Latency = SnappingClient == -1 ? m_Latency.m_Min : GameServer()->m_apPlayers[SnappingClient]->m_aActLatency[m_ClientID];`
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> why does it crash here
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> which one redix?
14:59 < Dune> the network ringbuffer?
15:00 < redix> yes. when there is a client with high latency sending all these packets might fill it up
15:34 < redix> hmm when the connection ringbuffer is full it should just drop the client... didn't read that the server crashes
15:36 < redix> but still... sending packets to all clients each tick might be too much for the netcode. snapshots do this much more efficiently
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> THATS WHY I AM SO MAD THAT WE DONT HAVE SKIN IN SNAP ANYMORE
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> sorry for caps
15:38 < redix> well... i agree on that
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :0
15:38 < Dune> maybe just send it less often
15:39 < redix> send it just every 2 or 3 ticks
15:39 < redix> or increase the network buffer size
15:39 < redix> or do both
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i asked oy, you cant increase it
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (he said)
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://discordapp.com/channels/407308363031117832/490150878934990850/635099018275323924
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> why does it crash there tho
15:40 < redix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/28946c3a84cfe31d1372f18d845fdcddec040bbe/src/engine/shared/network.h#L132
15:40 < redix> try to increase this value. might work
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> could you enable core dumps and give me a zipped version of the executable + core dump, @fokkonaut? Disord sucks btw.
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> uhm, can we do that tomorrow? i dont have much time left today
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> would need some help for that
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> doredump is created when the server crashes
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> cor
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> e
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> e
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> basically executing `ulimit -c unlimited` before starting the server executable
