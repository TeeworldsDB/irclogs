13:48 < kingteeger> Hey, I've a Question: Why I can't compile the actuall Teeworlds Source (from Github/teeworlds/teeworlds) in my enviroment? (Win 10, 64 Bit AMD, VS 2013(!), Bam 0.5) Teeworlds 0.6.3 works fine for me (I just had to fix a Bug in math.h.  I think it's due vs 2013))
13:48 < kingteeger> ""SDL.h": No such file or directory"  yeaa thats true! Because someone deleted the files on github lol 
13:48 < kingteeger> :D
13:49 < kingteeger> in src/engine/client/backend_sdl.cpp(2)
13:59 <@minus> you need to get SDL and freetype dev files + libraries
14:00 <@minus> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11870 you could try that thing
14:07 < kingteeger> Thanks, I will try it out
14:09 < Obani> kingteeger, you have BAM 5.0 ?
14:11 < kingteeger> Yes (Qoute: "(Win 10, 64 Bit AMD, VS 2013(!), Bam 0.5)") ^^. My PC is currently running the SDL install Script from Blade67. Then I can give you more Informations :)
14:13 < Obani> minus, I was enabled to compile teeworlds with bam 5.0
14:13 < Obani> I need to use bam 4.0
14:17 < kingteeger> @minus thanks, work for me
14:18 < kingteeger> now one error only left. The File ft2build.h can't be found (needed in src/engine/client/text.cpp(13)). And again I dont have this problem with the 0.6.x Source
14:19 <@minus> Obani: teeworlds' bam file has been upgraded to require bam 0.5 a couple days ago
14:20 <@minus> kingteeger: freetype probably not placed correctly or so; i suggest you try to find out why and then comment in that thread (or look there first?)
14:21 < kingteeger> ok thanks
14:21 < Obani> minus, ok that's why
14:22 < kingteeger> but i can say bam 0.5 is faster? :) 
14:22 < Obani> minus, I guess I should apply the change to the clients that didn't :)
14:22 <@minus> mh?
14:32 < kingteeger> I can't fix it. I'd answered in the topic. 
14:33 < kingteeger> Why did you remove the SDL Files from the Teeworlds Source?
14:37 < kingteeger> I have to go. I hope that they can help me through the forum
14:37 < kingteeger> bb
19:27 < magneticduck> indeed, why would anybody remove any library headers from a project's source!
19:30 < Henningstone> to clean up the repo because it are external dependencies I guess
19:36 < magneticduck> I'm being sarcastic
19:37 < Henningstone> oups, seems that sarcasm doesn't get transferred well in a text message :0
19:37 < magneticduck> I tried to type in italic by slanting my fingers slightly
19:38 < magneticduck> that could have conveyed the snideness, but my keyboard didn't pick it up
19:38 < Obani> Henningstone, sarcasm can be easily transferred by a chat message
19:38 < EastByte> exclamation marks in chat mostly indicate sarcasm
19:39 < Obani> You just need a higher brain level :3
19:39 < magneticduck> there's also /s and the backwards question mark
19:39 < Henningstone> Obani: I think I can't supply that :P
19:39 < magneticduck> Obani: it's famously difficult to distinguish between lower stupidity and higher sarcasm
19:39 < magneticduck> i.e. Poe's law
19:40 <@minus> ^
19:40 <@minus> i /could/ try to get teeworlds to build on my windows machine
19:40 <@minus> but i really cbf dealing with installing VS crap
19:41 < Henningstone> and i could try to build the sarcasm parser on my brain, apparently :3
19:41 < magneticduck> if I ever go forward with my plans to do stuff with the teeworlds client, I'd probably make a nix build file
19:41 < magneticduck> in that case, teeworlds would be buildable in exactly three commands on any linux machine, and two of them are amortized
19:42 < magneticduck> (amortized system-wide)
19:42 < magneticduck> Fuck Windows Development (tm)
19:43 < Obani> magneticduck, can I join your company ?
19:43 < magneticduck> you can be my company
19:47 < magneticduck> (don't worry, company isn't exclusive)
19:51 < magneticduck> mm, the nice thing about C++ development is that it gives me time to think
19:55 < magneticduck> sometimes even engage in hobby projects -- like knitting sweaters for my horses
19:56 <@minus> fascinating
20:00 < magneticduck> or memorizing the list of reasons that modules weren't accepted to be standardized in C++17
20:03 < magneticduck> all moderately sized C++ projects, at some point, enter the stage where you can finish a prolonged game of Rocket League before the project can rebuild
20:03 < magneticduck> this is known as the "first productivity dip"
20:08 <@minus> that implies you're running on windows tho, doesn't it?
20:08 < magneticduck> I do development on windows, sometimes -- sure
20:09 <@minus> i mean, rocket league is windows-only, right?
20:09 < magneticduck> supposedly it works on wine
