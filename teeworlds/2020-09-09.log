00:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> What is a `CNetBan::CNetHash::MakeHashArray`?
02:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> c++20 gonna be liiiiit
08:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Lit like a dumpster fire
10:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Don't be like that, c++20 is bringing some great features
10:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It is, yeah
11:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> header files, fuck header files üòÑ
12:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Modules, concepts, std::format are more than enough for me
12:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> ‚ù§Ô∏è
17:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> is tw cpu or gpu "bottlenecked"?
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> okay after quickly testing it's cpu bottlenecked for a single core
17:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> try `gfx_finish 0`
17:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> but at least if you have a dedicated gpu it's really limited by the cpu
17:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> mostly because it uploads all vertex data to the gpu each frame
17:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> by storing the text and map data on the gpu you can easily get ~90% gpu utilization while keeping the cpu load kinda low
17:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what does this command do? I have not quite but close to doubled my fps with it
17:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> it's still "just" 70-80% gpu utilization but much closer at least
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> `gfx_finish 1` makes sure that the gpu finished rendering the last frame before submitting commands for the new frame
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> in certain scenarios this can reduce input latency, but most of the time it just wastes gpu performance, since the gpu is idling while the cpu is preparing the new frame
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> in tw it usually does not matter. for me the game runs with >1000 fps anyway üòÑ
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @redix I think you kinda broke net_addr_comp, it no longer returns the correct order
18:55 < Oy> what order?
18:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Atleast the comment in system.h needs to be updated it never returns >0 anymore
18:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> If something like a sorted array of NETADDRs was relying on net_addr_comp > 0 to order it, it would have broken
18:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yeah okay. but i'd rather just change the docs
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Sure, but that won't leave any way to have an order relationship between NETADDRs just so you know
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> true, but one can add this if it's really needed
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> since we have prediction for other players now... what about projectiles? no real physics prediction, but rather just displaying them at the position for the predicted tick, so all objects on the screen are in sync
19:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> for high ping the projectiles may seem to spawn late and fly through walls then, but the experience with prediction for other players is also awful with high ping
19:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> just as a note: that would only require changing a few lines
19:21 < Oy> yeah, sure sounds good
19:23 < Oy> but should probably make a config for it, so people can turn it off. just in case
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yeah sure, it should also be disabled by default, like `cl_predict_players`
19:26 < Oy> yeah
19:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Dune if oy appears again, I started a versionsrv running on current master (2020-09-05, dccfaf9354af1dcfbdf60fc517f669346aa8b578) on version.teeworlds.com
19:28 < Oy> good thx, anyone tested if it works?
19:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @heinrich5991
19:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> iirc it doesn't
19:29 < Oy> hm ok, maybe it's the server?
19:30 < Oy> can't reproduce it and don't see any changes that could cause that
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> redix said "but still no response =\"
19:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah henrich5991.de works so it's the server somehow
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Anyone ever experienced the problem that you can see all servers in the browser, but cannot connect to any? After restarting the game everything is fine =\
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Maybe some uninitialized stuff...
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Cannot connect as in stuck on the connecting screen?
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yeah. times out after a few seconds
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Next time it happens, launch wireshark üòÑ
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yeah should do that ^^
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It happened to me once or twice before, but I chalked it up to the very broken 0.7 bridge stuff I was messing around with
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> experienced it several times, but it's kinda seldom
