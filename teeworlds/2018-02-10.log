10:08 <@minus> heinrich5991: obviously, since ipv6 causes problems
10:09 <@heinrich5991> "obvious" :P
10:09 <@minus> we tried it years ago
10:10 <@heinrich5991> need better protocol support?
10:10 <@minus> clients that have an ipv6 stack but no connectivity used ipv6 and thus got no server iirc
10:10 <@heinrich5991> yea, browsers use the "happy eyeballs" algorithm
10:10 <@minus> plus dualstacking of servers is unsolved
10:10 <@heinrich5991> try both ipv4 and ipv6
10:11 <@heinrich5991> yes
10:11 <@heinrich5991> need better protocol support :(

15:36 < pinkieval> what if only some of the master servers had ipv6?
15:36 < pinkieval> this way, clients without ipv6 have a fallback
16:17 <@minus> one exclusively ipv6-master should work
19:27 < day> teeworlds doesnt appear to work on multi screen setups anymore on linux (for a few month by now i believe)
19:27 < day> the second i use anything but fullscreen it fixes my mouse into the upper left corner
