01:06 < BeaR> hey, is there also a code patch for this new release?
22:11 < nameless_tee00> Hi, I've got a question about the fixed server crash in 0.6.3 release by making some integers unsigned. Wasn't it already fixed by "if(Chunk < 0) return;"?
22:12 < EastByte> no it wasn't
22:12 < EastByte> Offset still can be < 0 due to an integer overflow
22:13 < nameless_tee00> "m_pCurrentMapData[Offset]" would then cause the crash I guess, but It wouldn't even pass to there o.O
22:13 < EastByte> Offset < 0 would pass
22:14 < nameless_tee00> hm, ok
22:14 < nameless_tee00> so I need to fix my mod^^
22:14 < nameless_tee00> ty
