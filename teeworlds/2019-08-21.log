00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I find some of the Sonix skins very detailed and others have some weird symmetry / shapes
01:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> whis skins for vanilla official.
11:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Cool to hear you already worked on it @Sonix :)
19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what do you think of dragon decorations?

19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> like this
19:38 <@Dune> not teeish
19:38 <@Dune> too detailed
19:40 < Oy> yeah, what Dune said
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I mean not this logo in particular, but in general a dragon "tatoo"
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i mean not teeish is a point
19:43 <@Dune> tees are small, decorations should be lines, circles, hearts, but nothing too detailed like a dragon imo
19:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and a music note like in the music emote?
19:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> or a clef
19:44 <@Dune> decorations are more about patterns than images imo
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> this is a pattern, do this ðŸ˜„

19:48 <@Dune> Oy: you said there was a mixup yesterday, I'm not sure how though? I don't think the current PM blocks binds other than pageup/pagedown
19:52 < Oy> Dune: they shouldn't block any possible binds. right now when ingame the binds have input focus, everything works through binds, there are no blocked keys. it should continue that way. so best is to either have it like i posted there or second option would be to make that chatline up/down work via binds
19:54 < Oy> it's done with next/prev spectator f.e.
20:08 <@Dune> Alright, I think that is a good idea. A "pagenext" bind could be used for a 64p scoreboard as well
20:10 < Oy> yeah
20:16 < Oy> Assa: the decorations should be like markings, like you know from wildlife
20:17 <@Dune> they used to be called markings iirc
20:22 < Oy> seems like they still are, decorations are the things on the head :D
20:22 <@Dune> oh :D
20:24 < Oy> checked the code, to see when it got renamed and saw it then :D
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Assa - confusing devs since ever
