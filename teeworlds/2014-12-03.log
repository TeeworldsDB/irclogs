01:24 < pielover88888> hi Edible 
01:28 < Edible> hey pielover88888 
01:28 < Edible> nice to see you talking to me again
01:29 < pielover88888> with the alias, i'm less mad at you
01:29 < pielover88888> !seen Dunedune
01:29 < Nimda3> I've last seen Dunedune 22 days, 6 hours, 18 minutes and 53 seconds ago in #teeworlds saying "i may just want to spectate a game of my friends, right?".
01:32 < pielover88888> So i made it so spectators could spawn, by commenting two lines in the source..
01:32 < pielover88888> technically possible to hookfly with a spectator..
02:24 < Edible> YOU"RE AN ALIACIST!
02:24 < Edible> now what would be the point of spectating then?
02:32 < pielover88888> Cant take damage or be killed, unless through some weird glitch with Ninja.
02:32 < pielover88888> !wiki aliacist
02:32 < Nimda3> Your term doesn't exist at this Wikipedia Database.
02:33 < pielover88888> also it has shoot-through, including for hammers..no hammerfly, only hookfly
02:33 < pielover88888> they also disappear semi-randomly and come back semi-randomly
04:02 < pielover88888> Deku: do I know you? Deku/mint pi?
