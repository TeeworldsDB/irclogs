01:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> forum spam bs.
01:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe start an alternative forum test instance? this one has more spam lately than actual topics or posts :/
09:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> If no one does it, it will not be done
09:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> If spam is the biggest bother, just make new accounts have to get approval to post
09:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> If someone has the skills, time, motivation to make something better, go ahead
09:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Teeworlds has a total of 0 employees :)
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I dont know why, but sometimes my server keeps telling me No master servers, retrying in 60 seconds
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I can still find it in the master tho, even with deleted serverlist.json
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> It started to happen after I did some updates to vanilla master, dont know when
17:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> mh, server is not in master atm

17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> getting these a lot :/
17:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> a server restart fixes it again... Can anyone check if this occurs on current master?
17:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> cant reach again, even after restart? I didnt change anything in the code that should fuck this up, it happened after an update to vanilla master as i said...
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> udp protocol packet loss?
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no idea
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Marius told me to restart my vServer, will try that later
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> he said it fixed the problem for him
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> run a script in bg with the `ping` tool
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so you find out if it's package loss or another problem (like firewall?)
19:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> should work
19:05 < Hawdwin> test
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it just tells me no master servers, randomly it works and then it doesnt again, server runs stable, idk
19:39 < minus> i got credentials to set up a new master like 2 months ago but haven't gotten around to it
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> When I start my server, it nicely searches for the master, chooses one and starts sending heartbeats
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i hope i can find something suspicious why it randomly stops sending
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> tenemos un nuevo forum.
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> lol i can speak spanish
21:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Well, at some point - randomly, it says master server isnt responding, switching master, and from then it just searches and cant find masters...
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I had a vanilla server running now for some time, and it didnt happen there. What could cause this? I havent modified any of that code
21:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Teeworlds uses legacy OpenGL
21:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I will do a pull request, because a cmake flag is missing
21:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you can't compile with a newer opengl
