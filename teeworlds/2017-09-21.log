19:07 <@heinrich5991> matricks: is there a way of a
19:07 <@heinrich5991> only passing flags to the c++ instead of both to c++ and c compiler in bam?
19:08 <@heinrich5991> (suppose I wanted to enable c++11 support)
19:17 <@matricks> yes
19:17 <@matricks> cxx_flags or flags_cxx
19:17 <@matricks> dont remember which
19:18 <@matricks> flags_cxx seems more like it
19:23 <@heinrich5991> thanks, works
19:28 <@minus> C++17 is finalized, use that
19:29 <@heinrich5991> not supported in msvs
19:29 <@heinrich5991> even c++11 isn't completely supported
19:29 <@heinrich5991> but at least be happy to be able to use c++11 :)
19:29 <@heinrich5991> foreach loops!
