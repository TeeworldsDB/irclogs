22:19 < r2d2_> Hi all! Yesterday I tried to put up a post on the Development forum about my new map editor. Unfortunately, I did not understand whether my post went to moderation or there is just some problem with the forum. After submitting the form the number of posts in my profile still remains 0. Can anyone help me out? Thank you!
22:25 < minus> r2d2_: your post wasn't approved yet
22:25 < r2d2_> Thx! ^^
22:25 < minus> the forum isn't really in a good shape, spam is getting out of hand badly
22:35 < r2d2_> this is very sad :c I noticed recently that 6-10 new members register on the forum every day. Are these really people or are they spam accounts?
23:06 < minus> all spam
23:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> And the lockdown has already driven the activity to near-zero levels
23:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> The spam did that beforehand
23:56 < Dune> r2d2_: are you aware of the efforts to revamp the editor?
