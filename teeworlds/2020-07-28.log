00:30 < DuneIsHere> heinrich5991, minus: why am I getting email spammed by the forum mailer all of a sudden?
00:30 <@heinrich5991> hmm
00:31 <@heinrich5991> I don't see any mail :o
00:31 <@heinrich5991> i.e. idk. maybe minus knows
00:35 < DuneIsHere> heinrich5991, the mails I get are cc'd to your @g**.** address
00:36 <@heinrich5991> perhaps they're getting filtered hmm
00:38 < DuneIsHere> only saw them when I opened my spambox
