00:02 < minus> Dune: attached the banner and embedded it, i hope that works for everyone
00:03 <@Dune> thanks minus
00:03 <@Dune> works
00:04 <@Dune> isn't the zpB5N... attachment visible for everyone though?
00:05 <@Dune> can something be done about the "Download Teeworlds 0.6.5 for Windows" mention on the frontpage, later?
00:05 < minus> yes
00:06 < minus> $version = "0.6.5";
00:06 < minus> that can be changed
00:09 <@Dune> cool
10:51 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr opened pull request #1846: Add -msse2 flag to bam.lua for linux x86 compilation (master...fix-linux_x86) https://git.io/fp5zX
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> hi  all
20:12 <@Dune> hi
20:15 < minus> o/
20:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> still no release :(.... where is the problem?
20:21 < Oy> hey
20:21 < minus> \o
20:39 <@Dune> hey
20:40 <@Dune> What do you mean oy by " Could you check if it works if you remove #include <immintrin.h> //_mm_pause?"
20:40 <@Dune> surely it doesn't wokr without the include?
20:42 < Oy> it was just added for mingw
20:43 <@Dune> well, I would have to remake the docker, but sure, I can test that
20:43 <@Dune> isn't it better to not change the code though?
20:43 <@Dune> steam is ready
20:43 < Oy> cool
20:43 <@Dune> we gave some beta keys away for windows linux mac to check it works
20:44 < Oy> Lordsk build it without the line
20:44 <@Dune> @LordSk, you did?
20:44 <@Dune> I think he is on 64bit, that's why
20:45 < Oy> was his pr
20:45 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1553
20:48 <@Dune> hm
20:49 <@Dune> so I'll build again without the line, sure, but isn't the bam fix better?
20:50 < Oy> it builds without problems?
20:50 <@Dune> yes
20:50 <@Dune> that's what I used to build it/draft release on git&steam
20:51 <@Dune> ah, you mean without the line
20:51 <@Dune> haven't checked yet because I have to reinstall the environment, takes time
20:51 < Oy> ah ok
20:52 <@Dune> heinrich ran scripts and did some quality check in the night, he was of great help
20:52 < Oy> dunno if that include could create other problems, when it's just supposed to be used by mingw - then i would add include restrictions for it
20:52 < Oy> ok, good :)
20:55 <@Dune> it's installing
21:02 <@Dune> source zips are missing in github btw
21:03 < Oy> they appear automatically when u publish the release
21:04 <@Dune> oh, TIL
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hey did I miss something?
21:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah I'm on windows though, I think msvc includes intrinsics by default
21:14 < Oy> ah ok
21:14 < Oy> thought u were on linux
21:14 <@Dune> I compiled again with the x86 environment Oy
21:14 <@Dune> and when I remove immintrin.h, it doesn't compile
21:14 < Oy> ok
21:15 <@Dune> ah wait
21:15 <@Dune> should I apply the bam fix too
21:15 < Oy> no
21:15 <@Dune> alright
21:16 < Oy> then i'll add the bam fix
21:16 < Oy> arm shouldn't support it, but will fix that later
21:16 < Dune_linux> src/engine/client/client.cpp:1779:14: error: '_mm_pause' was not declared in this scope     _mm_pause();       
21:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Oy is x86 mingw working ok without -msse2?
21:17 < Oy> yeah
21:18 < Oy> tested ur pr with mingw and told u to include #include <immintrin.h> to make it work for mingw ;)
21:19 < Oy> we don't use the -m32 compiler flag for mingw so it shouldn't need the -msse2 flag
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah I remember
21:19 < minus> why _mm_pause instead of thread_yield?
21:19 <@Dune> cool then
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok yeah it makes sense then
21:19 < minus> pthread_yield*
21:37 < Oy> __mm_pause behaves better
21:37 < Oy> it's used for the fps limiter
21:37 < Oy> pthread_yield should behave like sleep on windows
21:38 <@Dune> :)
21:39 < Oy> https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-optimization-manual.pdf section 13.5.2
21:39 < Oy> Each call to Sleep() experiences the expensive cost of a context switch, which can be 10000+ cycles
21:39 < Oy> When there is no other thread waiting to take possessi on of control, this sleep loop behaves to the OS  as a highly active task demanding CPU resource, preventing the OS to put the CPU into a low-power  state.
21:40 < Oy> By slowing down the ‚Äúspin-wait‚Äù with the PAUSE in struction, the multi-threading software gains:  ‚Ä¢ Performance by facilitating the waiting tasks to ac quire resources more easily from a busy wait. ‚Ä¢ Power-savings by both using fewer parts of the pipeline while spinning. ‚Ä¢ Elimination of great majority of unnecessarily exec uted instructions caused by the overhead of a  Sleep(0) call. 
21:40 < Oy> In one case study, this technique achieved 4.3x  of performance gain, which translated to 21% power  savings at the processor and 13% power savings at platform level
21:43 < Oy> are we ready for the release then?
21:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Sleep() is also not very precise, Sleep(1) can take 1-15ms
21:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Dune are we ready?
21:44 <@Dune> yes. all red buttons ready
21:45 < Oy> then we should release :)
21:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> alright hit the buttons Dune!
21:47 <@Dune> in the night?
21:47 <@Dune> isn't afternoon better?
21:47 < Oy> better how?
21:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> dota 2 updates always happen late at night
21:48 <@Dune> people see it, download it, and meet on servers
21:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> while millions of europeans are waiting for it
21:48 <@Dune> now it's a bit late, but as you want
21:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I think this is fine
21:48 < Oy>  2011-07-31 21:43:56 release of 0.6.1
21:48 <@Dune> come on, we're better than valve, LordSk ;D
21:49 <@Dune> alright
21:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it's always late somewhere though
21:53 <@Dune> readying up

22:32 <@Dune> thank you minus

22:38 <@Dune> minus: a moment to run the version server?
22:40 < Oy> i think it loads as fast as the other images, but it's pretty big, 400KB. so u might notice
22:42 < minus> optipng'd it by 17%
22:44 < Oy> good
22:47 < Oy> Dune: do u know if it's possible to add a news for the steam library page https://www.solidfiles.com/v/M22GMAmnZaX82 like f.e. here https://www.solidfiles.com/v/6aaqz8Qr82g6x ?
22:56 <@Dune> hmm
22:58 <@Dune> heinrich5991 told me to not touch anything if possible
22:58 <@Dune> I'm not very fluent in steam
22:58 < Oy> ok. maybe he can do it later
22:59 <@Dune> yeah, I think that is best
23:01 < Oy> yeah, it's not a big problem, just noticed that there wasn't a news announcement and other games have it :)
