18:06 <@Dune> hey, there's some twitch developer/streamer doing Teeworlds right now! Implementing gamepad support at https://www.twitch.tv/tsoding :D
18:26 < day> Dune: has anyone ever looked into making teeworlds controller compatible? i think it would be perfect for controller play
18:28 <@Dune> well, there's that guy :)
18:28 <@Dune> issue https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/40 otherwise

18:35  * day demands xbox360 controller support
22:00 < rand> being banned, that has been a long time x)
22:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Hookbot? :D
22:11 < rand> hook/aim, everything x)
22:12 < rand> it seemed obvious but the guy couldn't explain how :c
22:38 < day> rand: my favorite is always how they complain about hooks and aim, but movement? nah
22:39 < day> that being said, I'm still not sure how my hooks have like a 90% hit chance whereas my railgun misses everything :P
22:40 <@Dune> because the hook isn't instant and you can adjust with movement I guess?
22:41 < day> i dont think you can readjust the angle can you?
22:41 <@Dune> so why does it feel so much easier to hook someone?
22:42 < day> no idea
23:14 < day> wp rand
