12:43 < heinrich5991> TIL if you turn a weapon counter-clockwise in teeworlds
12:44 < heinrich5991> and it's passing the vertical
12:44 < heinrich5991> the weapon does a full clock-wise round
14:51 < Dunedune> heinrich5991: like a bit overflow? but that shouldn't impact the visuals, right
14:51 < heinrich5991> no, I guess it's imperfect interpolation
14:51 <@matricks> huh?
14:52 <@matricks> oh, the interpolation is wrong then for some reason
14:52 < heinrich5991> yes
14:52 <@matricks> that should be fixed, I thought I fixed it :)
14:52 < heinrich5991> cyclic interpolation isn't trivial
14:52 < heinrich5991> matricks: if you fixed it after 0.6.2, then it might be fixed, saw it in 0.6.2
14:53 <@matricks> fixed as in fixed waaaay back
14:53 <@matricks> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/components/players.cpp#L207
14:53 <@matricks> ...
14:54 <@matricks> loads of stuff for doing the angular mixing: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/components/players.cpp#L76
14:55 <@matricks> and the angular stuff is commented out...
14:55 <@matricks> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/components/players.cpp#L219
14:56 < heinrich5991> if I had to guess
14:56 < heinrich5991> it's probably the commit "copied trunk to refactor"
14:56 <@matricks> saw it, anyway, should just be fixed

14:58 <@matricks> luls
14:58 <@matricks> just fix it :)
14:59 <@matricks> it comes from an optimization before
14:59 < heinrich5991> the video was how I found it
14:59 < heinrich5991> will fix it later, already created an issue for it :P
14:59 < heinrich5991> need to go
14:59 <@matricks> in previous versions, the game sent mouse x,y of the other player
14:59 < heinrich5991> ah
14:59 <@matricks> wayback
14:59 < heinrich5991> that could be interpolated :)
15:00 <@matricks> yeah, but normal linear
15:00 < heinrich5991> well, bye
15:00 <@matricks> BYE!
15:00 <@matricks> o/

16:11 < CookieMichal> http://is.gd/RSAICd
16:12 < PsychoGod> am, no thx <3
16:13 <@minus> matricks: heading home would be nice, still have to film a short movie/promo here
16:13 <@matricks> >.<
16:13 <@minus> i don't think i'm going home any time soon
16:31 < CookieMichal> I like cake
16:32 <@minus> we know already
16:32 < CookieMichal> That's alternative way to say hello
19:34 < d-t> hello
19:35 < d-t> i have a "little" problem there with programming, does any of you may can help me? *my english is the best *not**
19:37 <@matricks> depends
19:39 < d-t> im working on a clientmod with 128p support. sometimes my bots/dummys all disconnects with reason "Error sending data" and the server crashes.
19:39 <@matricks> the protocol can't handle that
19:42 < d-t> how i can fix that? change the 128 to a smaller value?
19:42 <@matricks> to get everything to work with 128 players, you need to make significat changes to the protocol and the code
19:43 <@matricks> you can't just increase the number
19:43 <@minus> so the code just is too bad :D
19:43 <@matricks> heh, no, the code isn't done for it more or less
19:43 <@minus> excuses!
19:44  * minus gets the pitchfork
19:44 < d-t> can you tell me, what i have to change?:D
19:44 <@matricks> isn't a part of the requirements
19:44 <@matricks> d-t: well, no, it's a lot and I'm not gonna sit here and go through everything
19:45 < d-t> but if i change all what i need, the protocol can handle 128 players without crashing?
19:46 <@matricks> no, the protocol only handles 16, you need to change it as well
19:46 < d-t> yea i mean if i changed it
19:48 <@matricks> there is non-obvious scalability issues to be solved as well
19:48 <@matricks> p2p collision is one of em
19:48 < d-t> isnt it handled when set MAX_CLIENTS to a higher value ?
19:48 <@matricks> there are many places in the code that is O(nÂ²)
19:49 <@minus> there's mods that do 64 players, might wanna hook into that
19:49 <@matricks> d-t: nope
19:49 < d-t> ok i will do, thank you -
19:49 <@matricks> minus: got more flying gear today :E
19:50 <@minus> "shut up and take my money"
19:50 <@matricks> hehe
19:51 <@minus> what'd you get?
19:51 <@matricks> a towing release for the tandem gear :)
19:51 <@matricks> so, nothing major
19:51 <@matricks> still costs like 50 bucks
19:51 <@matricks> (euro)
19:51 <@minus> what's it do?
19:51 <@minus> 50 SEK would be cheap :D
19:51 <@matricks> it connects your harness to the towing like with a mechanism to release it from the line
19:52 <@matricks> as seen in this video: http://vimeo.com/42879764
19:52 <@matricks> :)

19:54 <@matricks> tihi, my 12:th flight
19:54 <@matricks> wow, much noob, so bad
19:54 <@matricks> very nervous
19:55 <@minus> :D
19:56 <@matricks> kinda fun to have that kinda footage
