15:54 < fstd> or opinion, i guess
16:45 < Peasant65> It´s not a requirement to build packages though, you could just compile the binaries and put them in a tgz like you´ve done in the past. Provide them *as is*. If they don´t work for you, you´re out of luck 
16:46 < Peasant65> fstd, ^
16:52 < fstd> Peasant65: oddly enough, that's exactly what i did -- and you found out the binary didn't work for you, so you're out of luck :)
16:53 < Peasant65> fstd, yea, i´m not complaining about that, I was just reffering to your complain about the out-of-date binaries 
16:53 < Peasant65> (I did compile btw, works fine :)) 
16:54 < fstd> great
16:54 < fstd> btw, keeping them up to date would require me to additionally retain build machines for the respective architectures
16:55 < fstd> i'd provide binaries for NetBSD, but since i'm probably the only NetBSD user in teeworlds, it'd be pointless
17:08 < Peasant65> wouldn´t NetBSD work on most other platforms ?
17:09 < fstd> hm?
17:10 < fstd> i don't understand the question
17:28 <@heinrich5991> no, netbsd binaries wouldn't work on other platforms
