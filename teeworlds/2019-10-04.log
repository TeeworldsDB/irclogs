10:54 < Kottizen> jxsl13, as long as the website is alive, I am alive! 
11:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Since we already talked about a new release, @Dune could you look into https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2258 before we release a new version?
11:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ClipEnable doesn't work there for some reason, so I had to cap Linewitdh. For some reason it's not consistent. Text rendering is painfully inconsistent in general though...
11:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> What was your commit for anyway?
11:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Maybe we can just revert it?
11:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2198
11:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oof
11:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so how would you fix it? xd
11:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> #2258
11:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> No idea. Maybe the Linewidth calculation is too pessimistic, in which case it's not too hard. Maybe it's just the Textrender that is too inconsistent and in this case, it's hard
11:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is it generally that we cant write in the last 2 lines or why does it happen? because of the amount of newlines above?
12:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't know, you have to experiment to figure. You can see a full MOTD on the screenshot of the PR
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the navigation in the 0.7 map editor feels less precise :c and also why does it move stuff while zooming in and out?
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah now i get it it zooms to the cursor. Hm ok that can be seen as a feature i guess just have to get used to
23:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <BeaR> you can disable it IIRC
23:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <BeaR> `ed_zoom_target`
