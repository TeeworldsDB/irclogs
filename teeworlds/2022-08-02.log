15:23 < ChillerDragon> Why does my client send like 1000 null bytes in the beginning of the connection to my local server? Seems like a waste of bandwith
15:23 < ChillerDragon> or am i reading that wrong?
15:26 < ChillerDragon> yea no i confirmed with tcpdump that looks like waste
15:27 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1659446820.png
15:27 < ChillerDragon> the first three packets of client and server. It starts with a bunch of nullbytes from the client with a smol response from the server and yet another big chunk of nullbytes from the client. Whats the use of that?
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I don't know if all the null bytes are intended, but some of them are for amplification protection
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the problem with initial UDP packets is the potential for amplification attacks using spoofed attacks
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> since the server only responds to large packets (I think >512 bytes) with small packets (<50 bytes), the amplification factor is like 1/10, so no attacker is going to use that for attacking other servers
15:38 < ChillerDragon> ah i see ok thats fair
15:39 < ChillerDragon> i wonder if more data could be squeezed in tho like username and skin info etc
15:39 < ChillerDragon> but thats probably messing with the whole order of how things should work
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the very first packet can't contain a lot of data, the server won't remember any of it
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it's just going to send a challenge so the client can connect
15:40 < ChillerDragon> yea thats what i thought
15:40 < ChillerDragon> thanks a lot :) 
16:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <AssassinTee> you could hide secrets in this for your mod tho
17:53 < ChillerDragon> yeah nice idea :)
