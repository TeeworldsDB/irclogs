21:21 < koomi> so I was just playing on a server when my client posted my public IP and local port in chat without me doing anything
21:21 < koomi> several others players did the same
21:21 < koomi> and then the server died
21:21 < koomi> Teetime: ^ was your save server
21:22 < koomi> hm no, the server didn't die, it seems more like my client disconnected
21:23 < WolfAlex> koomi: add all servers to favorites and don't use the serverlist anymore, this is a stupid fix, but does work xd
21:25 < Teetime> hm.. yea i guess somebody grabbed the IPs from the serverlist request.. or is there any other way?
21:25 < deen> Teetime: yeah, that's exactly what they do, and then spoof your ip and send chat messages to servers to correlate ip and player
21:26 < deen> koomi: with ddnet client this shouldn't happen
21:26 < koomi> hm I see
21:27 < deen> next step for them then is to disconnect their target players or ddos their home connection
21:27 < koomi> I'm not going to use a different client though
21:27 < koomi> heh, have fun dossing my university
21:28 < deen> koomi: not sure if your university likes > 100 gbit/s ddos attacks
21:30 < koomi> we'll see, no load thus far
21:30 < deen> yeah, unlikely that you're their target
21:31 < koomi> what's up with all ddos kids, this has become much worse than it was some years ago hasn't it?
21:31 < deen> no, it's been pretty terrible for the last 2 years or so
21:31 < deen> wasn't involved before that
21:32 < EastByte> the main reason are all the stressing services
21:33 < EastByte> many even provide such attacks for free
21:34 < EastByte> related: http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/stress-testing-the-booter-services-financially/
22:02 < Teetime> I just updated my mod to tw 0.6.4, I hope this fixes the problem for now
22:04 < Henningstone> this breaks map downloading iirc
22:06 < EastByte> that's a client-side problem
22:07 < Henningstone> ah right. I knew there was something :D
