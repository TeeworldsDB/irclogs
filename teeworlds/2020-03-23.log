13:08 < Learath2> What is a m_PendingChatCounter?
13:23 < Learath2> One of you with admin access to the repo seems to have accidentally enabled circle again
13:56 < Learath2> @LordSk make sure you let popups store some context somewhere, I'll hack it in for now but it deserves a nice clean api
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yes
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @jxsl13 whats your problem with spec?
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2507 last comment
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @fokkonaut
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> gotta type everything manually in the chat, (was using the gamer client)
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> didnt watch the video, but i know the problem now
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> It is because command stuff did change a lot, very often without another release now. DDNet7 uses the latest master command system, aswell as the F-Client. So those can communicate. Wait for another vanilla release to be able to use commands without the need of pressing escape before seding it with vanilla client.
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> also, Dune could push an Update with the updated command sys
15:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> If you would use the master now, compile it and try again, it would work
15:02 < Dune> yeah my client is not up-to-date with trunk/master and the latest post-0.7.4 client-side features :)
15:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, k
15:27 < Learath2> For the record I did want to add a check to support older clients on ddnet7
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> do so
15:53 < Learath2> Too late, I'm busy wrestling with some UI code now
15:53 < Dune> o/
15:54 < Dune> what doesn't kill you make you stronger
15:59 < Learath2> It can be surprisingly hard to avoid dynamic allocations, I'm having trouble figuring out where to store the CUIButton's for each line of the listbox
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> do we avoid allocationsi n the editor as well?
16:01 < Learath2> @heinrich5991 I'm not sure if we have to but it's good practice to not have them in UI code
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it's good practice to not overdo them, e.g. not allocate each frame
16:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but having no allocations at all seems more like a goal you'd pursue for the goal itself
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8706420
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> note that it's not the omnibox that makes browsers heavy
16:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Learath2: you could make a smallish CUIButton array and do array[i % capacity] since there are few buttons displayed at once
16:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> That is already used in the server browser friends tab iirc. But imo a vector would be best fit here
16:31 < Learath2> eh, went for stateless buttons instead
16:49 < Learath2> Did one of you break popups in the last couple commits?
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> not me!
16:59 < Learath2> f7c6cbb3cc124582638d941cd076e36af528b069 broke popups @LordSk you can't just set POPUP_NONE every iteration
17:01 < Learath2> Ah, you just mis-simplified that if condition, you were only clearing the popup if it was the palette and space is no longer pressed or the tool has changed
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ah yes that's true now that I think about it
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> well patch it however you like, that stuff will go anyway
17:03 < Learath2> Yeah, just giving you a heads-up
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Learath2: btw, for the extended server info
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think I simply use an empty server name etc. for the server whose player packet arrives before the main packet
22:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @heinrich5991 can I expect a master ban or not?
22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i hope there are warnings before ban
22:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what did you do ðŸ˜®
22:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there is no info anywhere
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I didn't do anything, just requesting a ban.
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 we are uncertain whether your server's name is unique enough that you can claim ownership of the name
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon hart to do warnings if server owners don't give contact data somewhere
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> *hard. german lol
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm k.
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> RAWR
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> so no.
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 yea sure. But i mean if people that are active in this irc/brige are planned to be banned id hope there is some warning first.
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if we can find out who hosts the server, yes
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if there's no clue anywhere, no
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i see
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if it's ChillerDragon's DDRace server or the motd mentions ChillerDragon, I know who to contact
22:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, stressing network,.. xD rip vanilla
22:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you were unbanned
22:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 it's not the default config, "Simply zCatch Grenade"?
22:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no
22:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> default is unnamed server
22:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is there any fix to that stressing network problem in vanilla?
22:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe we need some server verification -  my MITM server has already got all the rcons
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 banned
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok, ty.
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> mine as well ðŸ˜® /assa?
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> rip
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> no I just got your bank account

22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yea, I banned 91.250.87.150
