01:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the heck is this pyramide of doom
12:20 < Learath2> does anyone happen to know where io.open in configure.lua uses as it's pwd?
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @jxsl13 we are now at 0.7.4, the pyramide is broken now ðŸ˜„
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> need a new shape
18:17 < Learath2> @Dune can you tick off the fixed ones in #1120 ?
18:37 < Dune> Learath2: none are fixed that I know of
19:00 < Learath2> Dune: 28.0f is not used in the gamecore anymore except as PhysSize
19:01 < Learath2> Hookstate isn't set twice anymore
19:04 < Dune> Learath2: thanks, updated
20:45 < Learath2> @LordSk this popup chain stuff is very horrible without lambda functions...
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Then perhaps we should change how it works
20:46 < Learath2> like setjmp longjmp would look less uglier then defining oneshot functions to chain them
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I'm not sure yet
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> The question was really just to know if you tried it
20:47 < Learath2> It'd be great if we could stop avoiding useful language constructs because Oy doesn't feel like it and @Dune thinks it'll make us magically accept dirtier patches
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and what you thought of it if you did
20:48 < Learath2> @LordSk if it was a single popup it'd be fine either way, but now that we need to chain popups, e.g. first Save As, then Load, callbacks look ugly
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Yes it is hard to follow
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Just do what's easy for now, we'll think about it later
20:49 < Learath2> Maybe an exit popup callback?
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I had one in place at first
20:50 < Learath2> eh even then I need an ugly one-shot function to chain the next as function pointers can only take a single signature
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> but I realize you could just call that code right before calling ExitPopup
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Well, that was aggressive
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> realized*
20:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> With that reasoning there is no reason to write C, always use cpp17
20:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I do feel similarly. lambdas have made it to *java*
20:52 < Learath2> @Dune as long as we only accept code reasonable code it's fine, just don't accept template messes?
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the backwards enterprise languages that was always behind
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that tries to be as boring as possible to be managable by businesses
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but we still don't allow it for teeworlds
20:52 < Learath2> lambdas, smart pointers, constructor delegation are all very useful features that help cleanliness more then they allow messes
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Well, it seems you feel more strongly about this than I do
20:54 < Learath2> @LordSk I'll just add another callback, you can clean it up however you feel like
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok
21:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok Learath2 I just had an idea. We could push the load popup then the warning one, and on yes push the save one. The load one should be sitting in the background until the other popups are closed.
21:08 < Learath2> Well in my opinion that's just a workaround, but sure, I'll do that
21:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> how so?
21:09 < Learath2> It's not the behaviour we intended but behaviour forced onto us through limitations of the code. I guess it's more of a compromise then a workaround
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I mean yeah, it's a different way of doing it
21:18 < Learath2> Doesn't work with "New" need an extra callback for that one
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok
21:29 < Learath2> Actually, doesn't work at all, we can't have multiple file select popups on the screen as we have a single state
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> can't we have 2 of those?
21:35 < Learath2> Sure, if you prefer having an entire extra file select popup state which has an entire file list of it's own instead of another callback
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I'm sure it's fine
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Dune sorry that cane out a little more agressive then intended, I get pissy when I have a headache
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> get well then :)
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> and thanks for the PR flood, I wouldn't have the energy
22:45 < Learath2> well it's good for me too, it makes me feel useful :)
