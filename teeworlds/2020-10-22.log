20:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> big issue
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Oof
20:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xD
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> sorry, i was not familiar with vanilla logic
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I mean I probably would be confused as well. But still funny nonetheless.
20:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> :D
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> What do you consider the hardest to understand teeworlds code?
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I go with everything related to sdl2
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I go with undocumented code
23:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> I haven't coded enough to judge, but currently editor code is giving me a real headache ^^
23:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> all of networking and the inner stuff is black magic to me though
23:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> just say: undocumented code ðŸ˜„
23:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> x)
