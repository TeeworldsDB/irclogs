01:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> in Go that is
01:10 < bridge_> <jxsl13> for the rest I was too lazy D:

07:19 < Metal> hi d_une i got same error like this post https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=111840#p111840 with `bam -c` and `bam -c all`
07:53 < Metal> reitw i added python to path manaully but nothing changed , i also think its because windows sdk
08:40 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Amazing you really did it? Thanks a lot. Yea the rest is fun did it in ruby and python already so itâ€™s just about getting familiar with Go syntax and finding the time
08:40 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> (@jxsl13)
08:41 < bridge_> <jxsl13> Would appreciate contributions to that library D:
08:46 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Not sure if you want my messy code haha
08:54 < bridge_> <jxsl13> imma review it :p and gibe feedback
08:54 < bridge_> <jxsl13> if you want
08:54 < bridge_> <jxsl13> give
08:55 < bridge_> <jxsl13> fot now parts of that library are in an unfinished messy state. At some one might refactor it and create a clean api for external consumption ðŸ™‚
09:18 < Metal> @d_une @ReiTW my output errors https://file.io/39nhJkpahqtR

09:32 < Metal> https://sharetext.me/kpruyzajje
09:33 < Metal> is this ok ?
09:34 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> seems like the generated files are still a problem
09:35 < Metal> is there any way to fix it ?
09:36 < Metal> everything was ok till i installed windows sdk 7.1
11:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> looks like python is still not found
11:02 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> you could consider trying with cmake. it'll at least tell you when python is not found. I don't have a lot of experience building the bam anymore
13:29 < bridge_> <d_une> @metal python probably not in your path. Open a console and type python
13:47 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> they left at 11:27 CEST
14:30 < minus> don't @ me
14:36 <@heinrich5991> I don't see anyone @'ing you
