00:35 < izmo2000> hi guys
00:35 <@minus> 'ello
00:36 < izmo2000> i don't have any sound at all in teeworlds
00:36 < izmo2000> i tried setting the snd device from -1 to 3 but no help
00:36 <@minus> what OS, where did you get teeworlds from?
00:36 < izmo2000> i use an usb-dac with alsa
00:36 < izmo2000> arch linux repos
00:36 <@minus> mh
00:37 <@minus> same here, but pulseaudio inbetween
00:37 <@minus> no idea about what the problem could be if you're just using alsa
00:38 < izmo2000> weird!
00:39 < BotoX> try other games that use SDL
00:39 < izmo2000> such as?
00:39 < izmo2000> does xonotic use sdl?
00:39 <@minus> warsaw i think
00:39 < BotoX> http://modarchive.org/forums/index.php?topic=793.0
00:39 <@minus> probably too
00:39 < izmo2000> well xonotic is fine
00:40 <@minus> heh, modarchive
00:40 < BotoX> well gn8 :3
00:40 <@minus> nn o/
00:42 < izmo2000> cat /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf: 
00:42 < izmo2000> options snd slots=snd_usb_audio,snd_hda_intel options snd_usb_audio index=0 options snd_hda_intel index=1
00:43 < izmo2000> think that has an effect?
00:43 < izmo2000> that's 3 lines :)
00:43 <@minus> nah, that just concerns the driver, which obviously works
00:46 < izmo2000> well fuck...it probably would work with the sucky integrated chip
00:59 < izmo2000> just to let you know minus, export SDL_AUDIODRIVER=alsa did the trick
01:01 < izmo2000> cya!
01:28 < Rajh> Someone has a design pattern for centralised accounts ?
01:29 < JulianAssange> Rajh: is all you do in this channel ask about centralized accoutns?
01:29 < Rajh> Dunno, is all you do taking a real people name as nickname ?
01:30 < JulianAssange> i have had this name since like 2011
01:31 < Rajh> Cool
01:35 < JulianAssange> have you been complaining about the lack of centralized accoutns since 2011?
01:42 < Rajh> Dafuk whats your problem
01:43 < Rajh> If you dont want to answer, just ... don't ...
01:44 < JulianAssange> http://teedune.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/some-facts-about-the-planned-account-system/
01:44 <@minus> >2015-4
01:44 < Rajh> lol
01:44 < JulianAssange> "There is no issue about that for 0.7.0, so it will not be done until the 0.8.0 release."
01:45 <@minus> man, things are going slow
01:45 < JulianAssange> it is still relevant 
01:45 < Rajh> Doesnt mean i cant do it ?
01:45 < Rajh> Who are you to prevent me from developping it ?
01:45 < Rajh> I'm just asking a design pattern
01:45 <@minus> as in, gang of four?
01:46 < Rajh> dont know it
01:46 < Rajh> minus, yeah i see things are going slow :(
01:46 < Rajh> seems like it didnt change since i left
03:49 < baklava-tee> Regarding the account system, I am not sure if this was mentioned before, but is it possible to implement it via IRC? Just one IRC server for the master server, and a channel for every game server. Is this possible/feasible?
03:50 < baklava-tee> With adding IRC support to the chat system of the client.
04:37 < Rajh> dont think so
07:17 < baklava-tee> @Rajh as for the design pattern, I just found this https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=112549#p112549
16:45  * yolo69 slaps BotoX around a bit with a large fishbot
18:10 < BotoX> ok
18:21 < EastByte> ok
18:21 < EastByte> BotoX: any progress on your bunnyhopping stuff?
18:21 < BotoX> I've managed to do it on the next day
18:21 < EastByte> oh
18:21 < EastByte> does it check whether the player hits the ground and then jumps?
18:21 < EastByte> or simpler?
18:21 < BotoX> 1 Perf: 0.999463 || Avg: 1.000498/892.489929 || BotoX<2438><STEAM_0:1:25587348><> || Map: ze_rawnscape_b2 || Last: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
18:21 < BotoX> it checks if you are pressing down the spacebar
18:21 < BotoX> tells the engine to release the jump flag after you're in the air
18:21 < BotoX> and waits until you land again and then jumps again
18:21 < BotoX> until you stop pressing the spacebar
18:21 < EastByte> hmm
18:21 < EastByte> how did you find offsets and stuff?
18:21 < BotoX> IDA
18:21 < EastByte> ah
18:21 < BotoX> found the offset on windows
18:21 < EastByte> so you analysed are part of the gameengine?
18:21 < BotoX> checked on the windows DLL
18:21 < BotoX> well, the engine is open source
18:21 < BotoX> so it's not really hard to do
18:21 < EastByte> oh
18:21 < BotoX> I just checked where it is on windows in IDA and then searched for nearby parts on the linux library and foudn it
18:21 < m80116> hello teeworlders !
18:22 < EastByte> hello m80116 
18:23 < BotoX> so, what do with drivers license
18:23 < EastByte> crash the car!
18:23 < BotoX> if you provide me one
18:23 < BotoX> that I can crash
18:23 < EastByte> buy a car!
18:24 < m80116> has anybody if you ever heard of ChickenMilk ?
18:24 < BotoX> Well, I have one, but I don't want to crash it D:
18:24 < EastByte> I heard the name
18:25 < m80116> yes... we're a clan... well... other then a conversation group because we played together in TW
18:26 < m80116> I was wondering what do you do in here... I made a channel for us because I thought we should stay independent from chat programmes
18:26 < m80116> and I like the IRC
18:27 < m80116> more than I do of Skype that's for sure
18:27 < EastByte> well you are not alone
18:27 < m80116> guess not
18:28 < m80116> QuakeNet... almost never entered before now
18:28 < m80116> I've always been... well in my past IRC times, many years ago... EFnet
18:32 < EastByte> haha you must be old :p
18:38 < m80116> well I am quite older than IRC :)
19:01 < Toast> any1 who can bash? 
19:01 < EastByte> depends
19:13 <@minus> EastByte | crash the car! ‚Üê been there, done that
19:13 <@minus> not as fun as it sounds
19:14 < EastByte> was it your fault?
19:14 < m80116> aren't cars meant to be driven not crashed ?
19:14 < EastByte> not sure about that
19:14 < m80116> one thing is sure... you can't crash it and drive it
19:15 < m80116> you could at most drive and crash it
19:19  * EastByte is afk
23:21 < ipv6stuff> I read here https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=journal&id=7576 that Teeworlds supports IPv6. True?
23:21 <@matricks> think so yes
23:23 <@matricks> quite sure of it when I think of it
23:23 <@matricks> I think we fixed the master servers and everything
23:26 < heinrich5991> ipv6stuff: there's still some issues, e.g. I think a server can only register as ipv4 or ipv6 at once
23:26 < ipv6stuff> That works too
23:28 < ipv6stuff> thx for info
23:35 <@minus> yeah, master server ipv6 stuff is broken
23:35 <@minus> fubar
23:52 < baklava-tee> This post dates back to 2001 https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10300 oO
23:53 <@minus> obviously the date was wrong
23:54 < baklava-tee> Yea, sure. And the user is registered at 2001, too.
23:57 <@minus> i just realized we don't have a link to the source/github anywhere visible
23:57 < heinrich5991> mhhh
23:57 < heinrich5991> that should really be visible somewhere
23:57 < Rajh> google teeworlds
23:57 < Rajh> its somewhere xD
23:57 <@minus> it's in the docs somewhere
23:58 < heinrich5991> not on the first google page
23:58 <@minus> but it should be on the front page and in the download section
23:58 < heinrich5991> on german google, on google.com it's the third result
23:59 < heinrich5991> Platforms: GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, OS X, Berkeley Software Distribution
23:59 < heinrich5991> .... no
23:59 < heinrich5991> oh
23:59 < heinrich5991> nvm
