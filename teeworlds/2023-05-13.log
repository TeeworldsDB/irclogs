13:38 < bridge> <Dune> I'm not sure if it matters so much at this point, but either way I'd rather contact Oy before taking any decision like that
14:09 < bridge> <Stiopa> Do you have contacts to him?
14:25 < minus> Dune: maybe not but that's besides the point. i don't think there's much point in talking about it much, but informing him is the least, yes
14:31 < ChillerDragon> @Dune imo it does slowly begin to matter. if we keep ignoring it it will stay in this state for years. but yes lets get Oy on here to ask him what we can do
16:28 < bridge> <Dune> @Stiopa yes
16:29 < bridge> <Dune> minus: I can understand refusing any sort of "we do nothing" answer from Oy, but it seems counter productive not to at least hear what he'd legitimately want us to do?
16:31 < minus> sure
16:36 < minus> just do what it takes to move forward, if talking to him works, then that's great
21:02 < bridge> <Stiopa> As long as something is done, it'd be great. And talking to Oy is good courtesy
21:19 < minus> you worded that much better than me
