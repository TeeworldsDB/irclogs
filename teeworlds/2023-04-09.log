10:06 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: the system messages are part of the engine and do not really know anything about the game
10:07 < bridge> <heinrich5991> both snapshots and inputs are transmitted in a way that makes the engine more or less oblivious of its contents
10:30 < ChillerDragon> ooo heinricho alive
10:31 < ChillerDragon> ah so everything sent from engine/ folder etc is system and game/ folder is game?
10:31 < ChillerDragon> interesting so it makes sense in the tw code base but when just looking at the protocol its less obvious i see
10:31 < ChillerDragon> thanks heinrich pro
10:36 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 ill quote you on that in my docs xd
10:38 < ChillerDragon> feel free to complain or suggest changes to my quote xd https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/07/system_messages.html
19:03 < bridge> <jxsl13> uih, nice @ChillerDragon documenting the protocol
21:51 < ChillerDragon> ye :)
