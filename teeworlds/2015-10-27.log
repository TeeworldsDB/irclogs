06:49 < eeeee> that Cider guy reminded me of Orz from Star Control 2
07:03 <@minus> uh
12:36 < Squz> Hi guys. Can somebody help me with server monitoring?
14:00 < allu2> Btw what does sv_high_bandwidth actually do? I read somewhere it doubles bandwidth usage but that doesn't really say why and what uses it has
14:01 <@matricks> allu2: it changes the snaprate from 25 snaps/sec to 50 snaps/sec
14:01 <@matricks> twice the amount of updates from the server
14:02 < allu2> And why this shouldn't be used in other then LAN games?
14:02 <@matricks> who said that?
14:03 <@matricks> if you have the bandwidth the spare, go for it
14:03 < allu2> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=server_settings
14:03 < allu2> "Use high bandwidth mode, for LAN servers only"
14:03 <@matricks> meh, doesn't actually do that much either way
14:04 < allu2> So most likely it wouldn't affect gameplay anyway?
14:04 <@matricks> it shouldn't, everything should be a little bit smoother
14:05 < allu2> So if bandwidth isn't my problem then its recommended to use it?
14:05 <@matricks> a bit meh :)
14:05 <@matricks> and if the clients doesn't have a problem with it
14:05 < allu2> Btw is the spoofed clients connecting problem fixed in 0.6.4?
14:06 <@matricks> dunno
14:06 < allu2> Had some kid spamming clients from random ip's and having them get banned for stressing network, filled the chat with crap
14:07 <@matricks> dunno, I don't keep track of the development
14:07 < allu2> :P
14:15 < heinrich5991> allu2: it's gonna be "fixed"
14:15 < allu2> So current 0.6.4 doesn't fix it?
14:16 < heinrich5991> the current attacks won't work anymore
14:16 < heinrich5991> but since the whole thing is a big backward-compatible hack, I'm not sure it fixes everything
15:16 < allu2> Ok so there is some sence in updating all my servers to 0.6.4 now
23:03 < Obani> Hey
23:03 < Obani> I've been playing this game for years and just started beeing active on Github and so I decided to join the IRC :)
23:16 <@matricks> `:)
23:18 < Obani> matricks, are you dev ? :p
23:18 < Obani> :/
23:19 < Obani> I'm trying to compile teeworlds
23:19 < Obani> (I'm installing the probably missing depencies right now)
23:19 < Obani> is the documentation up to dat ?
23:20 < Obani> (date*) And if yes, do I have to do fetch http://teeworlds.com/files/teeworlds-0.7.0-src.zip  ?
23:24 <@matricks> Nope, I was a dev
23:25 < Obani> ? :o
23:25 < Obani> What do you mean ?
23:25 <@matricks> I'm not a dev anymore
23:25 < Obani> because you're not working on the game ?
23:26 <@matricks> yap
23:33 < Obani> Can someone help me compiling the game ? :x
23:34 < Obani> minus ?
23:35 <@matricks> isn't there a guide for this?
23:35 < Obani> no
23:35 < Obani> I can't use it
23:35 < Obani> matricks, ah, forgot that https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds
23:35 <@matricks> don't use that
23:35 <@matricks> that is old as hell
23:36 < Obani> No I use that https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/blob/master/compiling_everything.md
23:36 < Obani> But fetch is not a command to me
23:39 <@matricks> fetch / wget/ curl
23:43 < Obani> Ok thanks :)
23:43 < Obani> I'll finally can try the dev version :)
23:45 <@matricks> for the dev version, you need git
