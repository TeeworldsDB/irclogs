15:00 <@Dune> heinrich5991, do you have any opinion on implementing the InterfaceID as described in the comments there? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/8e8e05c4f37670359b7b54a95a8b94285de4a7cc/src/engine/kernel.h#L26-L32
15:00 <@Dune> this would allow to have several elements of an interface, e.g. two m_pConsole, etc.
15:01 <@Dune> right now all interfaces have to register with an useless identifier, e.g. MACRO_INTERFACE("map", 0)
15:02 <@Dune> (of course, this could be worked around with an interface containing N sub-interfaces)
15:02 <@Dune> I have no experience in OOP design so :)
15:17 <@Dune> eh, I guess you need sub-interfaces either way :|
21:07 < day> today i realized teeworlds doesnt use the w and s buttons. and that theres no up and down :^)
21:07 < day> only took me 10years
21:12 <@Dune> pfft, I realized that weeks ago when I made the hints. I had drawn a 3x2 grid for WASD :/
21:21 < day> haha
21:21 < day> i now have rail and nade on w and s 
21:23 <@Dune> I'm wondering if it would be any good to bind "+weapon4;+fire"
21:24 < day> dont think so
21:24 < day> the problem is the shotty reload delay handling
21:24 <@Dune> I don't see the problem
21:24 < day> if you do nade and then hit the +weaponX;+fire it wont fire it will only switch
21:24 <@Dune> so what?
21:25 <@Dune> that's expected behavior?
21:25 < day> then why add the +fire if it wont fire in most cases?
21:26 <@Dune> well it should? do you hold down the fire key that often?
21:49 < rand> use w for jump !
21:50 < day> Dune: not sure what you mean, i never hold my fire key
21:50 < rand> `s` is for shotgun !
21:51 < day> switch to nade, click mouse1 once, instant switch to rail gun and shoot without waiting for the railgun to be equipped. 500ms later or so the railgun will 'spawn' but you wont shoot
21:52 < rand> do you fire before actual switching ?
21:52 < day> well thats what dune's binding would do, wouldnt it
21:52 < day> ?
21:52 < rand> (happen all the time for me bit I don't know if that's because i click before pressing switch key)
21:53 < day> and yes that behavior bugs me to no end. im a strong advocate for every weapon having its own cooldown
21:53 < rand> its binding says “change weapon; fire”
21:54 < day> well is it equivalent to 'change weapon && fire'?
21:54 < rand> i don't know
21:54 < day> or rather at the end of change weapon the weapon actually is changed*
21:54 < rand> I was expecting some sequential treatment
21:54 < rand> but, the input are sent simultaneously so…
21:55 < rand> I think the server does what you said
21:55 < day> well pressing '3' and 'shoot' is sequential. the command to switch the weapon came earlier, but the game doesnt actually swap the gun
21:55 < day> its just throwing the command into the weapon cooldown pipeline
21:55 < day> and the shoot command gets dumped
21:55 < rand> that right if you are in a cooldown
21:56 < rand> what happened if that is the first action in a while
21:56 < rand> *pens +?
21:56 < day> then it probably works
21:56 < day> lemme try. maybe it actually waits, that would be even worse :P
21:57 < rand> just tried, fire before switch
21:58 < day> yeah lol
21:58 < rand> iirc, fire is handled on tick, but weapon switch came after (some m_NextWeapon variable)
21:59 < day> would individual weapon cooldowns doable? or is there really just one global cooldown atm?
21:59 < day> be doable*
22:01 <@heinrich5991> day: then you could all five weapons in quick succession
22:01 < day> yeah thats what im after
22:01 <@heinrich5991> that sounds too much balanced towrads bots and not humans
22:02 < day> bots will delete you anyways
22:02 < minus> oh wow, 's' really is a free key in tw.
22:02 <@heinrich5991> w, too
22:02 < day> haha
22:02 < minus> does anyone actually use space for jumping?
22:02 < day> so im not alone :D
22:02 < day> i do
22:03 <@heinrich5991> I use space
22:03 < minus> hm
22:03 < minus> i played a lot of solday, so i use w
22:03 < minus> i use space to throw knife
22:04 < minus> hm, i wonder if teeworlds works on sway now
22:04 < minus> apparently pointer constraints has been implemented
22:04 <@heinrich5991> what's that?
22:04 <@heinrich5991> lifetimes in c++-speak? :)
22:04 <@heinrich5991> oh
22:04 <@heinrich5991> wayland stuff
22:05 < minus> yes
22:06 < day> w nade, s shotgun is an evil combo
22:06 < minus> oh shit it actually works
22:06 < day> the server agrees. everyone left ^.^
22:06 < minus> 700 fps, nice
22:07 < day> which gpu?
22:07 < minus> RX550
22:07 < minus> aka The Only Viable Wayland GPU
22:07 < day> really?
22:07 <@heinrich5991> why?
22:08 < minus> i mean you can get some Vega shit or GCN1
22:08 < minus> well, intel works too i guess
22:08 < minus> and nvidia with nouveau
22:08 < minus> if you want that
22:08 <@heinrich5991> other cards with similar names would work as well?
22:08 <@heinrich5991> similar to yours I mean
22:09 < day> ive to cap the fps otherwise my ears start to bleed due to all the coil whine :P
22:09 < minus> there is other ones ofc, but if you're buying one for desktop usage that works with wayland, RX 550 is the cheapest one that's not old
22:09 < minus> it's ~100€
22:10 <@heinrich5991> does it work with games? probably not for 100€
22:10 <@heinrich5991> ?
22:10 < minus> oh right, older AMD cards work just fine too, but those run on the radeon driver and don't do DP chaining, that was the issue there
22:10 <@heinrich5991> DP?
22:10 < day> displayport
22:11 < minus> i don't game
22:11 <@heinrich5991> teeworlds! :P
22:11 < minus> dunno if it runs CSGO or shit decently
22:11 < minus> well, teeworlds obviously runs on a potato (assuming said potato supports opengl)
22:11 < day> i barely have 2000fps D:
22:11 < day> i can feel the stutter
22:12 < minus> oh, 1200 fps on ctf5
22:14 < day> im hoping the intel gpus next year are decent...
22:14 < minus> would be cool if AMD made the good ryzens with integrated graphics
22:15 < day> always annoys me that intel puts gpus into theirs ;D
22:16 < day> feels like buying a cake and throwing half of it away
22:21 <@heinrich5991> you mean intel cpus?
22:23 < day> no gpus
22:24 < day> they are releasing dedicated gpus in the very near future. apparently some features were already patched into their linux drivers recently :)
22:28 <@heinrich5991> yea, also read that :)
22:36 <@Dune> if every weapon had its own cool down you would have a ridiculous dps by shooting them all at once day
22:36 < day> yes i know
22:37 < day> but that would be balanceable by simply reducing the over damage output, but it would make the game feel more responsive
22:37 < day> *the over damage output* << what was I thinking when i wrote that o.o
22:39 < day> i mean i am pretty sure you can do this in quake, or am i mistaken?
22:40 < day> well there certainly is a switching animation that prevents insta combos
22:40 <@heinrich5991> I bet only the cooldowns are lower or maybe the new weapon is shown instead of the old one when switching during cooldown
22:42 < day> In short: it is the same as always - all weapons have different reload time in order to make it fair. Before one can switch to the next weapon the reload time of the former weapon must be over.
22:42 < day> fk
22:42 < day> but anyhow as matricks always said. Teeworlds isn't quake! :D
22:50 <@Dune> I think it would be a bit dumb to have to constantly rotate between weapons to optimize your dps
