19:55 < EastByte> much dynamic
19:55 < BotoX> hope you guys have WebGL
19:56 <@minus> well, at least it has sauce
19:56 < BotoX> arrow key up/down to switch songs
19:56 < EastByte> ah it's music
19:57 <@minus> is that pattern synced to the song?
19:57 < BotoX> yeah
19:57 < EastByte> I dfon
19:57 < EastByte> stupid return
19:58 < BotoX> dfon
19:58 <@minus> how much of it did you code, BotoX?
19:58 < BotoX> the effects are made by some valve guy
19:58 < BotoX> and the rendering stuff
19:59 < BotoX> I decompiled the origin swf
19:59 < BotoX> and ported it over
19:59 <@minus> swf can run shaderz?
19:59 < EastByte> interesting
19:59 < BotoX> no, they do it with bitmap manipulation in SW
19:59 < BotoX> in the SWF
20:02 <@minus> could've done it in js too instead of with a shader
20:02 <@minus> but proobably not as smooth
20:03 < BotoX> haven't tried it
20:03 <@minus> so you copied the morphing code from the swf into the shader?
20:03 < EastByte> that would be pretty skilled I guess
20:03 < BotoX> nah, most of the stuff is copied from some other webgl js crap using pixie
20:04 < BotoX> pixi.js
20:04 < BotoX> the hardlightfilter
20:04 < BotoX> and the colorcrap

20:14 <@minus> oh lame, the blur animation is not done by the shader, just the colorization
20:22 <@minus> BotoX: good job though. now go make a proper demo :3
20:22 < BotoX> a proper demo?
20:23 < BotoX> https://googledrive.com/host/0B6wTJ67GewqrWDBuV185MEFDMjA/Versions/0x40%20hues%20v2.32S.swf
20:23 < BotoX> should look like this in the end
20:23 <@minus> i'm sure you're familiar with the demoscene
20:23 < BotoX> ah lel
20:23 < BotoX> I'm not really at that level haha
20:24 < BotoX> also compressing the music probably won't be that easy
20:24 < BotoX> pictures can be vectorized and compressed
20:24 < BotoX> since they're only black and white
20:25 <@minus> i said demo, not 64k
20:25 <@minus> though that would be fun too
20:25 < BotoX> >fun
20:25 < BotoX> I don't think you understand what fun means :D
20:25 <@minus> BotoX: ever replaced the X11 root window?
20:25 < BotoX> But a browser version is way better than an executable
20:26 < BotoX> the root window? idk what that is
20:26 <@minus> it's everything
20:26 <@minus> the desktop mainly
20:26 < BotoX> I don't think that I did.
20:26 <@minus> mplayer can render on the root window
20:26 <@minus> (mpv can't)
20:26 < BotoX> so above everything?
20:26 <@minus> other way around
20:26 < BotoX> as a standalone X11
20:26 < BotoX> oh, under everything
20:27 < BotoX> and the desktop is rendered above the root window or on?
20:27 <@minus> dunno
20:28 <@minus> in i guess, but it stays thesame
