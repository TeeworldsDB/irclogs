21:35  * tob is now away: off
21:57 <@matricks> good work
21:57 <@minus> he had his warning
21:59 <@matricks> HALP!
22:00 <@matricks> I have a encrypted disk I don't know how to mount :/
22:00 <@minus> how'd you encrypt it
22:00 <@matricks> ubuntu did :)
22:00 <@minus> not exactly helpful
22:01 < LittleWhite> Forgot the name of the program to do that
22:01 <@minus> cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdwhatever asdf && mount /dev/mapper/asdf /mnt
22:01 <@minus> might do the trick
22:01 < LittleWhite> that's it !
22:01 <@minus> assuming it's encrypted with dm-crypt
22:01 <@matricks> mount: unknown filesystem type 'LVM2_member'
22:02 <@matricks> :/
22:02 <@minus> aye
22:02 <@minus> you're trying to mount the wrong thing
22:02 <@minus> the thing you want to use with cryptsetup is /dev/mapper/lvmthingie
22:03 <@matricks> but.. huh.. the cryptsetup was successful :/
22:05 <@minus> it was, only the mount failed?
22:05 <@matricks> yah
22:05 <@minus> i see
22:05 <@minus> check if something appeared in /dev/mapper that you can mount
22:06 <@minus> in the for of abc-def
22:06 <@matricks> only the device I told cryptsetup to create
22:06 <@minus> if not: vgscan && vgchange -ay
22:06 <@minus> then look again
22:07 <@matricks> nothin'
22:07 < heinrich5991> minus: can you also tell me my password for my luks encrypted device? :<
22:08 <@minus> heinrich5991: dd if=/dev/zero of=â€¦ :D
22:09 <@matricks> sdc, has 3 partitions, sdc1 = EFI
22:09 <@matricks> sdc2 = /boot
22:09 <@matricks> sdc3 = /
22:10 <@matricks> sdc3 is of typ 'crypto_LUKS'
22:10 <@matricks> sdc2 is just ext2
22:12 <@matricks> doing a luks open on the sdc3 yeild a new mapper device with the type LVM2_member
22:12 <@matricks> filesystemtype that is
22:12 <@minus> you already decrypted sdc3 to /dev/mapper/asdf, that again now contains an LVM that needs to be loaded, that will yield another /dev/mapper/thing that you then can mount
22:13 <@minus> or at least it should, i did get it to work by running vgchange -ay
22:14 <@matricks> hmm
22:14 <@matricks> vgscan -v doesn't sat shit about that disk
22:15 <@matricks> lol
22:15 <@matricks> I popped the disk into my workstation instead
22:16 <@matricks> it just asked for the pw and mounted everything
22:16 <@minus> lol
22:16 <@minus> nice
22:22 <@matricks> nice, copying has started
22:22 <@matricks> need to go to ze store
