13:32  * minus explodes all over #teeworlds
13:32 <@matricks> ...
13:46 < heinrich5991> http://bash.org/?207373
13:46 <@matricks> hirr
13:53 <@minus> don't blame me for your dirty mind
13:54 <@minus> yeah, i'm gonna drop the cloudflare proxy for downloads.teeworlds.com
13:54 <@minus> totally bottlenecking
13:55 < BotoX> more OT https://i.botox.bz/shot0001.jpg
13:55 <@minus> with CF: 3m4s, without CF: 45s for 1.3G
13:55 < BotoX> to which ISP?
13:55 < BotoX> is it the peering from CF to downloads.teeworlds.com or from CF to you
13:56 <@minus> prometeus to accelerate
13:56 < BotoX> ah, makes sense
13:56 < BotoX> you could set up a CDN with rage4
13:56 <@minus> starts at a nice rate (up to 30MB/s) then drops (~5MB/s)
13:57 <@minus> gonna test if i get better performance in the US through CF
13:57 <@minus> http://{direct.,}downloads.teeworlds.com/everything.tar
13:57 <@minus> maxing out my 100mbit over cf
13:58 < BotoX> A friend of mine worked at rage4, maybe he can put my account to unlimited :o
13:59 <@minus> didn't you intern at a DC?
13:59 <@minus> wait what
13:59 <@minus> my US VPS is not on 100mbit/s
13:59 <@minus> getting 15MB/s without cf
13:59 <@minus> cool. it used to be on 100mbit/s
14:00 <@minus> naww, it dropped below 10MB/s
14:01 <@minus> avg 14.9MB/s
14:01 <@minus> nice nice
14:11 <@minus> hm, no ipv6 for teeworlds.com
14:11 < BotoX> NOOOOOOOO
14:11 <@minus> not even configured on the server
14:12 < BotoX> you terrible person
14:12 <@minus> idek
14:12 <@minus> gotta check for IPs then
14:17 < BotoX> https://p.botox.bz/yape.nginx
14:17 < BotoX> ipv6 for every domain + spdy
14:17 <@minus> auch mail von @mnus.de wird als spam gekennzeichnet ._.
14:18 <@minus> mh
14:18 < BotoX> hehe, wrong window :p

14:20 < BotoX> minus: you can switch to english again, this is #Teeworlds :v
14:20 <@minus> oh, wrong window
14:21 < BotoX> I just do include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf; in my nginx.conf

19:55 < nameless_tee15> Uhm, where did my post on the forums go? I want an explanation.
19:56 < nameless_tee15> DUNE
19:56 < Dunedune> nameless_tee15: hello
19:56 < nameless_tee15> Hi, what did you do to my post?
19:56 < nameless_tee15> It says moved, where is it?
19:56 < Dunedune> who are you
19:56 < Dunedune> your name is nameless_tee15.
19:56 < nameless_tee15> I'm Skeith
19:57 < Dunedune> check your inbow
19:57 < Dunedune> inbox*
19:57 < Dunedune> BotoX: lool this is gold
19:57 <@minus> BotoX: unfortunately, the comment is true (yay, spoilers)
19:57 < nameless_tee15> It's ddrace, I thought you didn't acknowledge ddrace? I thought you had nothing to do with ddrace?
19:58 < Dunedune> minus: how is it pedophilia when both are teens?
19:58 <@minus> orite
19:58 <@minus> well half of it
19:58 < nameless_tee15> zoom isn't cheating in ddrace.
19:58 < nameless_tee15> I'd like my post put back.
19:58 < Dunedune> nameless_tee15: we don't offer supports for mods
19:58 < nameless_tee15> Oh? Well then, why did you support your own emotions when you removed my post?
19:59 < Dunedune> however we'll still do our best to ban the use of cheat clients
19:59 < Dunedune> these are cheats in vanilla too
19:59 < nameless_tee15> It was in fan art and other
19:59 < Dunedune> it's exploit
19:59 < nameless_tee15> And? It's part of the ddrace client
19:59 < Dunedune> you're not even showing shame of using exploits
19:59 < Dunedune> the fact that some guy coded exploits is not a valid reason to use them
19:59 < nameless_tee15> Just put it back, love
20:00 < nameless_tee15> You can only use that "exploit" in ddrace
20:00 < nameless_tee15> It was literally made to where you can't use it in vanilla
20:00 < Dunedune> why is that?
20:00 < Dunedune> aha? duh
20:00 <@minus> what's this about
20:00 <@minus> i demand links
20:00 < nameless_tee15> aha? Why does it concern you that I'm using zoom when it's ddrace and you don't care for ddrace?
20:00 < nameless_tee15> He removed my post for using zoom on ddrace
20:00 < Dunedune> nameless_tee15: we dion't say we don't care about mods
20:00 < nameless_tee15> Like, who does that?
20:01 < Dunedune> we say we don't offer supports for bugs others created
20:01 < nameless_tee15> You made it fairly clear that you don't care about ddrace.
20:01 <@minus> brb while waiting for link
20:01 < Dunedune> we used to have threads of "help me make my ddrace mod work" etc.
20:02 < Dunedune> the ddrace mod having an "official" client that uses exploits is not a valid reason to post topics that promote it on the official teeworlds forum to me
20:02 < Dunedune> and I don't like your attitude, you're requesting something, don't give orders.
20:02 < nameless_tee15> I wasn't supporting anything.
20:02 < nameless_tee15> I like to play like that.
20:02 < nameless_tee15> Why are you hating on my personal preference?
20:02 < nameless_tee15> I'm sorry, just please put my post back.
20:02 < Dunedune> I like to kill people in the street
20:02 < nameless_tee15> It means a lot to me, dune
20:03 < Dunedune> why are you hating on my personal preference?
20:03 < nameless_tee15> I have a passion for let's plays.
20:03 < nameless_tee15> Oh, cool
20:03 < nameless_tee15> We share a common interest.
20:03 < Dunedune> that basically sounds like that
20:03 <@minus> what's that game in the video?
20:03 < nameless_tee15> Oh?
20:03 < Dunedune> minus: game?
20:05 < nameless_tee99> I don't know what happened.
20:06 < nameless_tee99> Dune, darling, let's be civil about this. I like to use zoom on ddrace, something you don't support to begin with.. But that doesn't stop me from posting about it on the forums, it's completely allowed.. Right? So, why do you have rules for something you don't support? 
20:06 < nameless_tee99> Aren't rules like some kind of support?
20:07 < Dunedune> posting DDRace stuff on the forums, such as the mod, clients about it, fanart, videos, etc... is completely relevant and allowed
20:07 < nameless_tee99> Hello, dune?
20:07 < Dunedune> goddammit you're not gonna get a 10s answer out of me
20:08 < nameless_tee99> Zoom is in a client about it, I was showcasing during that let's play.
20:08 < Dunedune> I thought you said to be civil about that.
20:08 < nameless_tee99> It's neat, right?
20:08 < Dunedune> promoting the use of exploits by showing the video of someone using that is forbidden on the Teeworlds forum
20:08 < nameless_tee99> You're really hurting my feelings, dune
20:09 < Dunedune> then you should have used another tone on the first place
20:09 < nameless_tee99> You completely ruined my let's play.
20:09 < Dunedune> which has only one video at the moment
20:09 < nameless_tee99> I'm tone deaf, sorry
20:10 < Dunedune> heinrich5991: he has a point though, the client only allows zooming out within DDRace
20:10 < nameless_tee99> Thank you.
20:10 < Dunedune> although posting videos showing that exploit on the Teeworlds forum should not be allowed imo
20:10 < Dunedune> do you disagree?
20:10 < Dunedune> I gotta go eat, cya
20:11 < Dunedune> besides: this is IRC, don't expect people to answer within seconds. He will answer when he will be back, do something else meanwhile.
20:11 < nameless_tee99> My let's play!!!
20:20 < nameless_tee06> I'm waiting for dune to aid me on my let's play journey, I need something to pass my time.. Ideas?
20:21 < nameless_tee06> Hello? Is anyone there?
20:22 < nameless_tee06> Chew faster please, Dune
20:23  * nameless_tee06 slaps Dunedune around a bit with a large fishbot
20:24 < nameless_tee06> Cool, slap button
20:24 < nameless_tee06> 1v1 me dune, slap
20:24  * nameless_tee06 slaps Dunedune around a bit with a large fishbot
20:26 < nameless_tee06> Anyone wanna 1v1 slap me?
20:26 <@minus> if i do, you ain't coming back
20:36 < nameless_tee50> Sorry, my connection dropped.. About that slap fight, I trust you.. You can slap me but try to be gentle. Don't hurt me senp
20:37 <@minus> senp? sendpain?
20:37 < nameless_tee50> No... no.. no...
20:38 < nameless_tee50> Only a little bit, minus.. Not too much.
20:38 < nameless_tee50> Don't leave a mark.
20:39 < nameless_tee50> The teachers might ask about it, that could lead to problems.
20:42 < nameless_tee50> Do it minus!!! MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A MAN!!!

22:31 < Learath2> interesting person
22:39 < Dunedune> heinrich5991: ping me when you'll be here
23:02 < heinrich5991> Dunedune: I'd allow such a post I guess
23:02 < heinrich5991> assuming what that I understood everything correctly
23:02 < heinrich5991> he has a video of a client
23:02 < heinrich5991> which he says is only capable of zooming in ddrace
23:02 < heinrich5991> and he only shows it there in the video
23:03 < Dunedune> yeah
23:03 < heinrich5991> that'd be fine with me
23:03 < Dunedune> hm ok
23:03 < Dunedune> is there anyone relevant for a third opinion?
23:03 < heinrich5991> ask minus or so
23:13 < RUSterrorist> What about me
23:13 < RUSterrorist> You want to know my opinion?
23:17 < nameless_tee09> Yo dune, you there?
23:18 < Dunedune> nameless_tee09: i told you to see heinrich5991 
23:18 < nameless_tee09> Yo heinrich, you there?
23:19 < nameless_tee09> And I don't recall you telling me to do so, sorry?
23:19 < Dunedune> accurate, sorry, I thought so
23:23  * nameless_tee09 slaps heinrich5991 around a bit with a large fishbot
23:23 < RUSterrorist> So aggressive
23:23 < nameless_tee09> Says the terrorist
23:32 < heinrich5991> nameless_tee09: hello?
23:33 < nameless_tee09> Hi, my post was removed on the forums and dune told me to talk to you.
23:34 < nameless_tee09> It was removed because I used zoom in the video but I was playing ddrace where it really doesn't matter.. And I was using a client that only allows the use of zoom while playing on a ddrace server.
23:36 < heinrich5991> nameless_tee09: ok, do you still have a backup of said post?
23:36 < nameless_tee09> Yes, give me a second.
23:38 < nameless_tee09> http://puu.sh/ahfg0/669b917c16.png
23:39 < nameless_tee09> The video was a joke (Obviously) but I still would like the post put back because I don't believe it really violated any actual rules, zoom isn't considered an exploit in ddrace and you can only use it in ddrace.
23:41 < nameless_tee09> If there is a rule against "exploiting" in videos, I believe zoom in ddrace should be an exception.
23:45 < heinrich5991> nameless_tee09: I restored your video
23:45 < heinrich5991> *your post
23:46 < nameless_tee09> Thank you! :)
