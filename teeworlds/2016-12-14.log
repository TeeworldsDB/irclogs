22:53 <+necropotame> minus, you talked before about a file that describes the compilation process. Landil may have also svg files for tilesets. Why all of that is not public ? There is more resources related to teeworlds dev that is not released ?
22:54 <@minus> well, i just wrote a couple of notes when working on the file, might not even have it anymore
22:54 <@minus> if you bug me again in a couple of weeks i might write a journal entry on the steps of teeworlds compilation
22:54 <@minus> i have no info on the tilesets stuff
22:55 <+necropotame> Oh, I see. It sounded bigger when you mention it yesterday ^^
22:56 <@minus> the only thing we're holding back is the release date of 0.7 =D
22:56 <+necropotame> Because there is one ? :D
22:57 <+rand> soon enough
22:58 <+necropotame> Like in one week in teeworlds calendar, that represents in the normal calendar 2 years
22:59 <+rand> at least, dev prevent remote code execution on clients :3 
23:00 <+necropotame> I'm asking for those not because I'm interested by them (my code is not even a fork), but because it make the game development more robust in case of personal problem/leadership problem, etc
23:00 <+rand> does your mod with targets is still working/running ?
23:00 <+rand> s/does/is/ -is
23:01 <+necropotame> No. 
23:01 <+necropotame> TeeUniverse is just an editor atm
23:02 <+rand> oh, i saw screens on the forum but I though the basis was the same as before
23:02 <+necropotame> The server and the client are not yet implemented. (I use the editor to make sure the core is okay, like how sprites are defined, how animations are done 
23:02 <+rand> ok, that's why it's not a fork (anymore?)
23:03 <@minus> my todo list has ideas for games of my own, so i'm all set
23:03 <@minus> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
23:03 <+necropotame> Yes, I've removed everything. I've just imported some code for basic stuff like graphics and storage
23:03 <@minus> and the design :P
23:03 <+necropotame> More or less ^^
23:03 <@minus> didn't matricks say that the kernel part was a mistake?
23:04 <@minus> speaking of
23:04 <@minus> !seen matricks
23:04 < Nimda3> I've last seen matricks 73 days, 15 hours, 50 minutes and 30 seconds ago in #teeworlds saying "Stitch626: http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/232/768/e84.jpg".
23:04 <+rand> what's the idea behind engine/interface/register in teeworlds code ?
23:04 <+necropotame> Mine is different. I don't use those interfaces
23:05 <+necropotame> The kernel is just a list of component that are updated one after the other. Each component can call the others. That's it. No more virtual call for graphics
23:05 <+rand> (yours or teeworlds' ?)
23:06 <+necropotame> TeeUniverse
23:06 <+necropotame> TeeWorlds use a weird kernel that try to hide the implementation of each component. The result is that it's painful to edit something and that it's slower
23:07 <+rand> so you have some singleton kernel that has a list of single instance class
23:07 <+necropotame> Yes. There is also different level of kernel : shared, client, game
23:07 <+rand> that could be fun to have another server implementation respecting all physics and gameplay of the official server
23:08 <+rand> (that's not a fork like teeunivers)
23:08 <+necropotame> This is what I'm trying to do, but with cross compatibility between 0.6 and 0.7 in addition
23:08 <+rand> *TeeUniverse
23:09 <+rand> are the two version gameplay compatible ?
23:09 <+necropotame> More or less
23:10 <+necropotame> Atm, the collision part is the same
23:10 <+necropotame> For the rest, it's just a matter of warping between both protocol
23:12 <+rand> is collision the only thing that can differ in teewolrds (except protocol) ?
23:12 <+rand> i mean, if the information are the same and are computed the same way, the protocol is not a big issue
23:13 <+necropotame> Yep. There is also the map, but my approach is to make them use the TU format, then convert in both 0.6 and 0.7 depending of the client
23:23 <+necropotame> All of that would be easier if TeeWorlds dev accept to implement some sort of mod support *innocent*
23:24 <+necropotame> And from what I've seen, "mod support" is in fact just a matter of better abstraction of the actual game (instead of hard code everything)
23:25 <+rand> implement some lua api for easy modding without build everything :3
23:25 < Henningstone> Uh ever so fancy lua :3 :3 Awesome stuff that is
23:26 <+necropotame> I will add lua script, but I think it's good to keep some limitation in it.
23:26 < Henningstone> rand: I started to make a mod with all the gamelogic done completely in lua, but oh dear porting that whole thing is so much 
23:26 <+necropotame> The graphics should not be made using lua script for example
23:27 < Henningstone> * gamelogic meaning serversided gamelogic
23:28 <+necropotame> The collision in both server and client should be made in lua script. That way the biggest limitation in the game will be removed
23:28 <+rand> Henningstone: i only tried to make an simplified api (in order to port my bot in lua). I succeed to made him jump but i got some segfault sometimes
23:29 <+rand> collision in lua script ? 
23:30 < Henningstone> rand: there is a cool thing called luabridge which makes everything so much easier
23:30 <+rand> why should it be in lua for both ?
23:30 <+rand> Henningstone: i guess i like the difficulty ;)
23:30 <+rand> (before using some good stuff)
23:33 <+necropotame> Because, if the server can send this lua scripts like maps, then we will no more get prediction problem in case of new version of mod. That's also what TU will do: send all game related files like maps (sprites, sounds, materials, GUI style,...)
23:33 <+necropotame> New version or mod*
23:34 < Henningstone> Oh I'd be the first one to send you the most useful script ever when you join my mod hehe
23:34 < Henningstone> and that's where the problems begin
23:35 < Henningstone> you need to take so much into account inorder to prevent people from abusing it :/
23:35 <+necropotame> ?
23:35 <+necropotame> that's why I said there is some limitation needed in lua script
23:35 < Henningstone> yeeeeaaaahhh but you can never have enough limitations :3
23:37 <+necropotame> What kind of abuse are you talking about ?
23:37 < Henningstone> fun stuff like this for example: https://apocrypha.numin.it/talks/lua_bytecode_exploitation.pdf
23:37 <+necropotame> you mean that lua script are not safe ? mhh
23:39 <@heinrich5991> that site isn't responding for me
23:39 <+necropotame> same for me
23:39 <@heinrich5991> but maybe it isn't talking about something that could be exploited from lua, but only from lua bytecode? :)
23:39 <+necropotame> It's a trap :D
23:41 < Henningstone> Nevermind, Lua should be fine... there are always things that are kinda "unsafe" if you work with computers I guess
23:43 < Henningstone> here's the pdf from the site:  https://mein-twserver.de:8877/lua_bytecode_exploitation.pdf
23:44 < Henningstone> dunno how good it is though, just picked one randomly that was fitting the topic
23:45 <@heinrich5991> they say JS would work. if someone can exploit that, they're rather going to exploit it in the browsers :)
23:53 < Henningstone> probably true :) But you know the teeworlds community :3 Doing bad shit just for the sake of having it done is quite a thing (probably not the kind of stuff *that big*, but you know what I mean xd)
23:58 <+rand> ddos is a common thing in our community x)
23:58 < Henningstone> aswell as the most boring kind of attack imo
