16:51 < Dune> o/
16:51 < Dune> > Maybe showing a box with less alpha when they're not selected
16:52 < Dune> a box that takes all the width of the column?
16:53 < Oy> yeah, like the one when u select the header of the column. do one with less alpha for the ones that are not
16:53 < Dune> then they would all have to be centered for it to look good
16:54 < Dune> but the map one f.e. will look off
16:55 < Oy> just the header
16:56 < Oy> u wanted to put a box around the whole column?
16:56 < Dune> problem is, the map column is large but most maps are 4-5 characters, so the centered header looks off :/
16:56 < Dune> owell
17:05 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpAAl

17:20 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 99d12c9 oy: small improvement
17:22 < Dune> so the meeting will take place too late for any change before xmas, realistically

17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I was wondering, yesterday you told me "don't mess something up" (about the editor), did you have anything specific in mind?
17:30 < Oy> well, now the editor is pretty stable, there used to be some hard to catch bugs/crashes in the past and for some time
17:30 < Oy> shouldn't go there again
17:30 < Oy> :)
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> alright I'll make sure that does not happen then
17:32 < Dune> or you could make the new editor *an option*
17:32 < Dune> haha jk
17:33 < Oy> input might be tricky, furthermore use the dobuttons functions etc. from the menu - they should be save input-lock wise
17:33 < Oy> if u keep the basic structure it should be fine
17:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> input-lock?
17:41 < Oy> there used to be some gui locks in the past where the input was frozen
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hmm okay
17:43 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/828
17:44 < Oy> these kinda chings
17:44 < Oy> *things
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok, so I should definitely use CMenus functions?
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> be cause I'm not right now
17:51 < Oy> would be best to perevent code duplication
17:52 < Oy> is there sth that is missing?
17:53 < Oy> or merge them later one
17:54 < Oy> Dune: u fixed this https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1776 right?
17:54 < Dune> in https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1895
17:55 < Dune> merging the PR will close the issue
17:58 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed pull request #1895: Adjust chat messages to not display UID when option is turned off (master...adjust-uid-msgdisplay) https://git.io/fpA1T
17:58 < Oy> oh, thought i did already :)
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah I'll see about merging them later then, easier for me to do
18:00 < Oy> ok
18:00 < Oy> and don't use DoButton_SpriteClean from menus
18:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> hi
18:01 < Oy> hey
18:01 < Oy> Dune: when motd is empty it won't be displayed
18:39 < Dune> Oy: motd wasn't empty on the servers I checked
18:41 < Dune> @Sonix: got any plans for xmas works? :)
18:50 < Oy> ok
19:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @oy, Slayer*gV* and I want to revive your old domination mod but with some changes (I found the old patch :D)...  is this ok for you as the original creator? We will of course name you in the credits etc...
19:21 < Oy> yeah sure go ahead
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> cool thanks
19:25 < Oy> reviving flagball might be cool too :D
19:29 < Dune> sources anywhere?
19:29 < Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=7622 gives 404
19:30 < Dune> ah well I have the 0.4 there http://tmp.dominik-geyer.de/teeworlds/teeworlds-0.4.2-mod-flagball-0.1.9.patch.html
19:31 < Oy> i ported it to 0.5
19:31 < minus> i'd enable attachments in the forum for everyone, but we're not set up for that storage-wise
19:35 < Oy> then probably better to not do it :)
19:35 < Oy> Dune: jini-zh.org/teeworlds/flagball/flagball-0.2.0.patch seems to work
19:35 < Oy> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=82604#p82604
