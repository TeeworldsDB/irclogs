18:05 < Learath2> There is a very annoying bug on macOS that crashes the client if I switch workplaces
18:05 < Learath2> workspaces*
18:06 < Learath2> only when fullscreen
18:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> at least you don't have a memory leak like my gnome
18:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's a SDL bug?
18:14 < Learath2> The crash? Seems so
18:14 < Learath2> happens on the swap command and I don't have debug symbols for sdl so I cant track it deeper
18:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @ChillerDragon mind commenting on https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2475 , especially the clan tag part.
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I though about it
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> It is currently not possible to get clans from the logs hm?
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think not
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is there any better way to prevent people from possibly exploiting their nicknames to kill th elog parsing, other than putting 15 whitespaces there
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nicks & clans
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as whitespace is the only stuff that seems to get trimmed from nicks Oo?
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is it possible to have empty nicknames on ddrace? on vanilla it was seemingly possible, dunno if that's still the case.
18:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I removed it for ddnet
18:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in 0.7
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 it got treated as duplicate nick, leading to "(1)"
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> are duplicate nicks treated properly Oo? (1) -> (2)....
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes afaik
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm k
