18:15 <@minus> EastByte: better?
18:17 < EastByte> if you are okay with that, yea
20:37 < Speedy_Consoles> hi there, i have a little problem compiling a modified teeworlds client with gcc
20:37 < Speedy_Consoles> the same code worked with msvc on windows
20:37 < Speedy_Consoles> i call closest_point_on_line in vmath.h from somewhere else
20:37 < Speedy_Consoles> and it tells me
20:38 < Speedy_Consoles> src/base/vmath.h:84:58: error: ‘clamp’ was not declared in this scope, and no declarations were found by argument-dependent lookup at the point of instantiation
20:38 < Speedy_Consoles> and later:
20:38 < Speedy_Consoles> src/base/math.h:9:10: note: ‘template<class T> T clamp(T, T, T)’ declared here, later in the translation unit
20:39 < Speedy_Consoles> any idea?
20:46 < Speedy_Consoles> branch is 0.6 btw
20:48 <@minus> maybe you're calling it with wrong arguments
20:50 < Speedy_Consoles> i'm not calling clamp, i'm calling closest_point_on_line
20:52 < Speedy_Consoles> if i called closest_point_on_line with wrong arguments it should complain about that in a different way, shouldn't it?
20:52 < Speedy_Consoles> full output btw: http://pastebin.com/FBcQBwFr
20:58 < goo> what is the tick rate for teeworlds game?
20:59 < EastByte> 50 afaik
20:59 < goo> thanks EastByte 
21:44 < Learath2> Speedy_Consoles: feels like #include "math.h" in vmath.h is getting ignored 
21:45 < Speedy_Consoles> but what does the note mean?
21:45 < Learath2> note ?
21:46 < Speedy_Consoles> src/base/math.h:9:10: note: ‘template<class T> T clamp(T, T, T)’ declared here, later in the translation unit
21:47 < Learath2> thats why i said its somehow getting ignored as vmath.h closest_point_on_line requires math.h clamp
22:18 < BotoX> change it to <math.h>
22:18 < BotoX> and see if it helps ?¿
22:18 < BotoX> ¿ ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ?
22:18 < BotoX> I remember having an issue like that before, years ago……
22:32 < BotoX> #include <math.h>
22:32 < BotoX> #include "math.h"	// mix
