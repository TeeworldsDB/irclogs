10:40 < ChillerDragon> oh thats bad @jxsl13 yea i wait for the first message which gives me ip and then assign the name of the next message to it
10:41 < ChillerDragon> id*
10:42 < ChillerDragon> oh hm looking at my code it could still work
10:42 < ChillerDragon> ``[server]: player is ready. ClientID=0 addr=172.20.10.9:52244`` tells you a new player joined
10:43 < ChillerDragon> ``[game]: team_join player='0:ChillerDragon' team=0`` then you parse id here and assign the player a name
10:43 < ChillerDragon> so order doesnt matter since both include ids
10:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it might work. as id is shared
10:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah
10:46 < ChillerDragon> the big trap is tho that the second message does not gurantee to have a name
10:46 < ChillerDragon> in like 1 out of 1000 it is a invalid name
10:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> wat
10:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Really? I thought that log message couldn't happen before we already have startinfo
10:48 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/chillavanilla/TeeworldsEconMod/issues/49
10:48 < ChillerDragon> this is one is easy because there is another message clearing it up
10:49 < ChillerDragon> but i already had cases with team_join connecting followed by pickup message with name and nothing inbetween
10:49 < ChillerDragon> if i remember correctly
10:50 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 its super rare my server crashed like twice because of that since its running
10:51 < ChillerDragon> maybe not 1 of 1000 but 1 of 5000 idk
10:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Oh this is completely luck based
10:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ENTERGAME happens before STARTINFO
10:53 < ChillerDragon> yea thats not too nice :/
10:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Actually, no I don't see why that's happening
10:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ENTERGAME won't happen before you get a SV_READYTOENTER which you won't get before you send STARTINFO
11:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I might guess that it's simply an empty nickname?
13:49 < ChillerDragon> no but there are no name changes in 0.7 @jxsl13 so it can not be first a empty nickname interpreted as (connecting) and then a different name
15:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, read the logs in the issue.
15:23 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> team_join message might be sent to the logs too early.
