09:38 < bob> hi
09:39 < bob> i have a question about teeworlds 0.6.x
09:39 < bob> can i compile 0.6.x teeworlds source with visual studio 2022 ?
09:40 < bob> what version of bam i need ?
09:41 < bridge_> <d_une> Probably doable with vs2022 but don't use the last bam version. I think the last is 0.5 so use 0.4?
09:43 < bob> there is no "make_win64_msvc.bat" for vs2022 in bam 0.4
10:03 < bridge_> <d_une> You can edit it to add vs2022 to the list of supported architectures most likely
10:06 < bob> with bam 0.5.1
10:06 < bob> Could Not Find c:\bam\bam.exp
10:29 <@heinrich5991> bob already gone
10:30 <@heinrich5991> but if their source has a CMakeLists.txt, that might be slightly easier
16:11 < minus> bam is ridiculously verkill for teeworlds tbqh
16:11 < bridge_> <d_une> got something simpler that does the job, minus?
16:12 < minus> make probably does the job
16:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> CMake is widely used for C++ projects
16:13 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> it's hard to make pure make work with MSVC
16:14 < bridge_> <d_une> make is less readable than cmake/bam though
16:14 < bridge_> <d_une> I don't see the benefit?
16:52 < bridge_> <jxsl13> cmake is standardized but it's overly complicated...
16:53 < minus> jesus teeworlds' cmakelists.txt is over 2000 lines
16:54 < bridge_> <jxsl13> cmake is rip
16:54 < bridge_> <jxsl13> in every aspect of rip
16:55 < bridge_> <d_une> partly because it lists every file
17:03 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I don't see much better solutions than CMake
17:03 <@heinrich5991> I quickly checked, it's 800 lines of listing files
17:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> I also doubt that there is anything better
17:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> bit it's still rip ðŸ˜„
17:05 < bridge_> <jxsl13> you have rust as comparison
17:11 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> that doesn't help to compile c++ ^^
