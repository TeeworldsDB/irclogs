12:16 < Lisiro> Heyo
12:16 < Lisiro> I think I did something wrong o/ http://i.imgur.com/qlkswuW.png
12:18 < EastByte> what's wrong with that?
12:18 < Dune> well, these are not apparently not terminating
12:19 < Dune> looks like it doesn't like it when I use bam -j 2 too often =p
12:19 < EastByte> oh
12:19 < EastByte> ah case for matricks I guess
12:20 < Dune> I think they conflict or something
12:20 <@matricks> You rang?
12:20 < Dune> ding dong
12:21 < Dune> I think this comes from running bam -j 2 before the previous bam -j 2 completes (maybe?)
12:21 < Dune> Trying to configure sublime text for bam ><
18:37 < Dune> back
18:39 < Dune> matricks: It seems like configure.lua is a generic file useful as is for other projects than Teeworlds. Is it released somewhere under a separate license or do I still have to include Teeworlds' license.txt file in my own project if I want to use it?
18:43 < Dune> or maybe I'm mistaken and it's Teeworlds specific
