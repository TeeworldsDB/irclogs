16:39 < BotoX> Look what I've built mates: https://imgur.com/a/WmP9u
16:43 <@minus> BotoX: 1MV output?
16:43 < BotoX> was a microwave oven transformer
16:43 < BotoX> cut the secondary coil
16:43 < BotoX> and put that big copper cable through it
16:43 <@minus> the cable seems unnecessarily thick
16:44 < BotoX> it has to handle ~500A
16:44 < BotoX> the primary coil has 230 windings and is connect to 230V
16:44 < BotoX> so every winding on the secondary equals one volt
16:45 < BotoX> two windings = 2V and since the primary can handle 1000W the secondary should be able to push 500A
16:45 <@minus> oh, i was thinking the wrong way around
16:45 < BotoX> Well, I was able to melt screws and coins with it
16:45 < BotoX> also welded a few things together
16:46 < BotoX> have to find some good copper contacts or something, to make a spot welder out of it
16:46 < heinrich5991> (that sounds super dangerous...)
16:46 < BotoX> no it's not really haaha
16:46 < BotoX> the original transformator was
16:46 < BotoX> since it was producing, I think 1.5kV?
16:47 < heinrich5991> I don't remember my physics lessons, but I think that can jump 1.5cm
16:47 < BotoX> yeah, about that for low current stuff
16:47 < heinrich5991> (I mean, it can bridge 1.5cm of air)
16:47 < BotoX> yeah
16:47 < BotoX> but when it does that
16:47 < BotoX> it turns the air into plasma
16:47 < BotoX> so you can do much more than that
16:48 < BotoX> because of the high current output of that thing
16:48 < heinrich5991> great
16:48 < BotoX> anyways, I cut the secondary and replaced it since that was too dangerous
16:48 < BotoX> and now it only outputs lovely 2 volts
16:50 <@minus> can you touch it?
16:50 < BotoX> yeah, of course lol
16:51 < BotoX> (I wouldn't touch it when you short the two wires though :P)
16:51 <@minus> ;D
16:51 < BotoX> first I tried was melting a 5 cent coin
16:51 < BotoX> it got so hot the asphalt under it started burning
16:51 <@minus> nice
16:52 < BotoX> also sparks flying everywhere on some metals
16:52 < BotoX> got the microwave out of the trash
16:53 < heinrich5991> BotoX: at least you tried it outside :D
16:53 < BotoX> nah in my dads workshop ^^
16:53 < heinrich5991> where does the asphalt coem from? ^^
16:53 < BotoX> the floor is asphalt
16:54 < BotoX> he's a mechanic
16:54 < BotoX> so, ofc. he does welding in there too etc.
16:56 < heinrich5991> ah
16:59 < BotoX> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZpBMfA9lZs
16:59 < BotoX> got the idea from that guy
17:09 <@minus> literally insane
17:09 < BotoX> haha
17:09 < BotoX> check his other videos then
17:10 < EastByte> definitely do this at home
17:11 <@minus> link me the second bread knife video
17:11 < BotoX> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcjGRXTpHGI&spfreload=10
17:15 <@minus> heh
17:46 < Learath2> oh yeah that guy is crazy
