04:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/TeeworldsEconDiscordModerationBot has been updated to work with vanilla. have fun. (please report bugs if you find any)
10:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 love the detailed readme
10:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Is there any way to specify config values on multiple lines? Like the Econ ip config line can get very long
11:01 < Dune> don't thikn so
11:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @jxsl13 this looks really nice, you can add a moderator call button, too! like `!admin` or `!report` so a post is created in the dc. Nice Project!
13:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you can call moderators from ingame via @mods, @admins etc.
13:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or what do you exactpy mean witu call button Oo?
13:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @everyone does anybody know the developer of the ball/tabletennis mod? Or does anyone have the sourcecode for it? I want to port it to 0.7
13:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> thank you, got pm'ed ‚ù§Ô∏è
13:41 < Learath2> We had a huge problem with bridging tw to discord, without accounts people just end up spamming discord...
13:42 < Dune> Yeah right, that doesn't sound very sane
13:56 < Learath2> @LordSk where is the brush selector in the new editor? I see the code but I don't see what rect it's supposed to be rendered in
13:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @ChillerDragon reading the used package documentation, you can actually do yaml style configs, I have not tried it, but you might do multi line with yaml.
13:57 < Learath2> oh it's not even using m_UiCurrentPopupRect
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Yeah the popup stuff is not great at the moment, that's actually what I am working on right now
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Learath2: `CEditor2::RenderPopupBrushPalette()`
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> migjt try to add a backslash at the end of lines
14:02 < Learath2> @LordSk just so you know, I'm writing a file selection dialog to start fixing up #2503
14:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> That's kinda out of the scope of this issue
14:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> but sure why not, we'll have to do it anyway
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @Fisico made a visual concept yesterday, if you could use that https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/510815644648865815/691030817954201670/editor_open.png
14:06 < Learath2> Yeah sure
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> nice
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, after etsting, it's apparently not possible to have multi line configs.
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> testing
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> üòÆ there is even the preview for images there (Y)
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (Y) <- thumbs up
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ?
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> in the concept art üòÑ
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yea i put features in that are not doable i think üòÑ
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Yeah well I was supposed to post that in an issue, and say that most of this functionality won't be available until much later (if at all)
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I have an issue open for that exact feature.
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as selecting mapres/tilesets is more of a memorizing game nowadays.
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> it is not a tileset/mapres preview... it is the open map dialog
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> oh rip :/
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Also Learath2, one last thing: please just use the editor2 ui stuff, I know it's ugly (and purple), we'll make everything pretty in the end.
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> mini map preview then
14:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yes
14:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I guess that might be hard to do.
14:15 < Learath2> Previews are not too hard to get
14:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm k
14:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> you have to load bits of the map if you select it. And show a ingame view?
14:16 < Learath2> @LordSk do you want the file selection thing as a dialog or do you want it fullscreen?
14:16 < Learath2> @Fisico pretty much, but it'd be horrible without caching and asynchronous loading, too slow
14:17 < Learath2> Not sure how useful a preview of that size would be though, for images I understand but maps can get huge
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Learath2: whatever you feel is best for now
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> names are often not that great to remember.. a small preview often give you the right hint to select the right map
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> names are often not that great to remember.. a small preview often give you the right hint to select the map you are searching
14:39 < Learath2> I'm not familiar with what you did to the UI code in 0.7 let alone the editors UI code, I get the entire screen with UI()->Screen() right?
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> That shouldn't have changed
14:40 < Learath2> I get the entire screen, I map the graphics screen to it, I draw an overlay but it won't cover the entire screen
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> you probably don't need to map it
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> the brush palette popup has an overlay
14:43 < Learath2> @LordSk one that doesn't cover the entire screen either
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Ah yes that's true
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> `m_UiScreenRect` should cover everything
14:45 < Learath2> Yet it doesn't, I have a feeling this is a highdpi issue
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Do you have a screenshot?
14:48 < Learath2> sure, 1sec
14:49 < Learath2> @LordSk https://learath2.info/sshot1.png
14:50 < Learath2> https://gist.github.com/Learath2/4dac5df8841858d3aafb6a51a3c857f2
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Alright so either you're rendering too early and the other stuff comes on top, or you're not using the right rect
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Ah great I was going to ask you about the code üôÇ
14:51 < Learath2> I'm rendering all the way at the bottom of RenderMapEditorUI(), maybe you are accidentally modifying m_UiScreenRect along the way?
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Ah I see what's happening
14:53 < Learath2> Well I tried getting the rect from *UI()->Screen() too, that also doesn't look right
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> There is a clip where you inserted your function
14:53 < Learath2> aha, missed that
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ```
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk>     // popups
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk>     if(m_UiCurrentPopupID == POPUP_BRUSH_PALETTE)
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk>         RenderPopupBrushPalette();
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> 
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk>     if(m_UiCurrentPopupID == POPUP_MENU_FILE)
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk>         RenderPopupMenuFile();
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> 
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk>     UI()->ClipDisable(); // main view rect clip
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ```
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> which is my fault really, as I said the popup stuff is not done at all
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I was going to setup an easier system and then ask people to help me on it
14:55 < Learath2> I just assumed the popup stuff was working, didn't even think twice to check there :D
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Yeah...
16:52 < Learath2> Immediate mode gui is really fun to work with...
16:53 < Learath2> https://learath2.info/sshot3.png
16:53 < Learath2> Took me like 2 hours to get everything laid out
16:55 < Dune> imgui looks cool yeah :) bit overkill for teeworlds tho
16:57 < Learath2> Well what teeworlds has is immediate mode gui, imgui is just a library that also implements the idea
16:58 < Dune> ah, nvm
16:58 < Dune> so the "really fun" was sarcasm?
17:12 < Learath2> yep :D
17:54 < Learath2> Did you know that CTextCursor never get's it's font set ever
18:14 < Learath2> Did you know that the text we render is actually thicker then the height of the cursor?
18:16 < Learath2> s/thicker/taller
18:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> TextRendering is full of wonders I've heard
18:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @Learath2 very nice work
18:17 < Learath2> How do we ever align something vertically?
18:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't know if all those features should be implemented though, looks like a lot of work
18:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Do we ever do that?
18:17 < Learath2> text is usually centered vertically in buttons
18:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Learath2: don't try too hard on these
18:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> We don't have a precise way of mesuring text bounds (yet)
18:19 < Learath2> These things always keep getting pushed back and they just end up never getting done
18:22 < Dune> that's true, that's because there is always more important stuff to do
18:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> you guys need hex values for the colorS?
18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Well I have a text bounds thing working, perhaps I should PR it at some point
18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> You could just use the DrawText() function Learath2 for now
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @Fisico we may need the icons, if you could make one image with all of them that'd be great
18:52 < Learath2> @LordSk I did, I also patched in horizontal alignment for it
18:53 < Learath2> I used unicode symbols for the icons, they just don't align too well vertically
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah ok that's fine
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> as I said making things pretty comes later
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i have a question... my icons are bad is tw allowed to use fontawesome? https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Your icons are great
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> we nood a lot of icons, i have to draw them all
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> we need a lot of icons, i have to draw them all
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> https://fontawesome.com/license/free
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> looks good....
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> stuff that is not there i will make on my own, i see no reason to spend time on making new icons for stuff that is already there
19:24 < Learath2> We really should be making an icon font for ourselves and merging that with the font we ship at compile time
19:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> That sounds sane yeah
19:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Keeping it separate might be best though
19:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> You have things like chinese fonts etc  that would be harder for users to insert without breaking the icons
19:27 < Learath2> Unicode has PUAs we can use
19:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> PUA?
19:38 < Learath2> Private Use Area
19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> File popups should be basic imo. Favorites, sorting options, previews, etc can come later
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Critical bits should be done first imo
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> So we have something releasable
19:39 < Learath2> It's fairly easy to hide the parts that are not done for a release
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah, true
19:39 < Learath2> Besides I'll be done with the file dialog way before the entire editor is done
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @heinrich5991 there is someone copying my servers
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @learath2, can you add sent commands to the history, please?
19:41 < Learath2> @fokkonaut is that really wanted?
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i find it very annoying that its not
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> especially if you missspell some stuff and need to retype everything for example
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and just in general
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its weird that its not added to history
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/691356231054524486/Bildschirmfoto_2020-03-22_um_19.42.37.png
19:43 < Learath2> It's not exactly trivial (chat history code looks a little convoluted), so I'll only take a look if people actually want this
19:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i'd love it
19:46 < Learath2> I should get the color rework in sometime, HSL would be much easier to work with when coloring the ui
19:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 do you know who that is?
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> let me join that server, maybe there is some info
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> BTW, can we move player info to the snap again?...
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> these newclient and disconnect packets are so *** ...
19:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @Assa , stop what you are doing
19:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ?????
19:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/691360131417374840/Bildschirmfoto_2020-03-22_um_19.58.05.png
19:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what are you crying about? You don't have any money on your bank account either way
19:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> true :'/
19:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
20:15 < Learath2> @LordSk I kinda like the way you set up the ui components, the components themselves having a little bit of state goes a long way
20:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> thanks üôÇ
20:16 < Learath2> ofc it comes with the drawback of being able to accidentally get the ui and the actual state out of sync, but I think it's worth it
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah I'm not sure if all of that stuff will stay at the end, since we're supposed to merge with main teeworlds UI stuff
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> we'll see
20:19 < Learath2> Well CUI is really not in the best state
20:20 < Learath2> (it is a bit better then it was in 0.6 though)
20:25 < Learath2> @LordSk while you are here, how do you handle scrolling?
20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Scroll regions
20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Check out the main teeworlds code, it has a mini doc
20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> the editor one is the same
20:28 < Learath2> found it, thx
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there's docs in tw?
20:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nice.
20:31 < Learath2> about 10 lines worth :P
20:38 < Learath2> https://learath2.info/sshot4.png I guess I'll take a break, get some sleep and finish it up tomorrow
20:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> looks good!
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah! :)
