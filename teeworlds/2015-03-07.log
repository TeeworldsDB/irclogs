21:17 < jxsl13> how do I detach a teeworlds server screen from terminal?
21:17 <@matricks> -D
21:18 <@matricks> or just -d
21:18 <@matricks> you want the d
21:18 <@minus> ctrl-a d
21:18 < jxsl13> well I tried something like screen -AmdS teeworlds_srv
21:19 <@minus> you're not supposed to start it that way when running it as a daemon
21:19 < jxsl13> the folder contains a autoexec.cfg file, yet nothing is shown in the screen
21:19 < jxsl13> only screen -d teeworlds_srv ?
21:21 < jxsl13> whats the full command ._.?
21:21 <@matricks> what are you trying todo?
21:21 < jxsl13> starting multiple tw servers
21:21 < jxsl13> from one terminal
21:21 < jxsl13> and switching between those screens
21:21 <@matricks> so you wanna start it in a screen and detach it immediatly
21:21 < jxsl13> yes
21:22 <@matricks> -d -m
21:22 <@matricks> Start screen in detached mode. This creates a new session but doesn't attach to it. This is useful for system startup scripts.
21:22 <@matricks> reading manuals
21:22 <@minus> run it as a system service, god damnit
21:23 <@minus> and attach to the logs
21:23 <@minus> teeworlds_srv doesn't accept input anyway
21:23 < jxsl13> hm, the screen -d -m cmd didnt do anything
21:23 < jxsl13> no screen started, neither did the tw server start
21:24 <@matricks> did the server quit immideatly for some reason?
21:24 < jxsl13> don't know
21:24 <@matricks> speeling, not foor evry one
21:25 <@matricks> jxsl13: can you do the -d -m with something simple to try that it actually works?
21:25 < jxsl13> if I were to use it like ./tw_srv it would start perfectly and a while ago it started with the screen -AmdS option quite well, now I kinda don't get it started anymore
21:25 < jxsl13> sadly no other testing material
21:25 < jxsl13> :c
21:25 <@matricks> what do you mean no other testing material?
21:25 <@matricks> cat?
21:25 <@matricks> watch?
21:25 <@matricks> gdb?
21:26 < jxsl13> binaries for testing
21:26 <@matricks> less? tail?
21:26 <@matricks> loads of options here for testing
21:26 < jxsl13> my linux knowledge is quite limited I must say :/
21:27 < jxsl13> none of those names ring anything
21:27 <@matricks> they are standard in every unix system
21:27 < jxsl13> ok
21:27 <@matricks> (almost)
21:27 < jxsl13> let's see
21:28 < jxsl13> ._.
21:28 < botnik> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=._.
21:29 < jxsl13> when I do screen -r screenID  I get angain an empty screen
21:29 < jxsl13> tried watch
21:29 < jxsl13> screen -d -m watch
21:29 <@matricks> ...
21:29 < botnik> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis
21:29 <@matricks> watch terminates directly if you don't give it anything...
21:30 <@matricks> "watch ls"
21:30 <@matricks> it runs a command ever 2 seconds
21:30 <@minus> what are you trying to do?
21:30 <@matricks> start multiple servers in screens apperently
21:30 < jxsl13> screen -m -d "watch ls"
21:31 < jxsl13> ?
21:31 <@matricks> jxsl13: dunno if " is needed
21:31 <@matricks> I don't have screen installed so I can't test
21:32 < jxsl13> when I switch to the screen I see the folder content of the folder I was in
21:32 <@matricks> then it works
21:32 <@minus> http://ix.io/gMl some screen startup script i wrote years ago
21:33 < jxsl13> how do I terminate that watch screen .?
21:34 <@matricks> jxsl13: http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/html_node/Invoking-Screen.html
21:34 <@matricks> time to RTFM
21:34 < jxsl13> read text for mroe?
21:34 < jxsl13> more?
21:34 <@matricks> read the fucking manual
21:35 < jxsl13> x)
