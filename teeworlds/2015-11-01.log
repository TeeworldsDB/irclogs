12:08 < Obani> heinrich5991 ?
12:08 <@heinrich5991> Obani ?
12:09 < Obani> can you explain me where did I got wrong in my explanation ? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1349#issuecomment-152780628
12:11 <@heinrich5991> are you TheRealOrangus?
12:11 < Obani> no
12:11 < Obani> I'm ObaniGemini
12:12 < Obani> (ying yang)
12:13 <@matricks> Obani: balance is more then just team balance
12:13 <@heinrich5991> I believe what they're trying to say is that it's hard to create maps
12:13 <@heinrich5991> you could argue that a symmetrical map is all you need
12:13 < Obani> That's just what I told :/
12:14 <@heinrich5991> but the good vanilla maps offer much more than that: good movement, weapon placement, etc.
12:14 <@heinrich5991> what is what you told?
12:14 <@matricks> weapon/armor/health balance
12:14 <@matricks> offensive vs defensive balance etc
12:14 < Obani> Make a balanced map : A map that does not disadvantage a team to another ?
12:15 < Obani> "So it would be harder to make balanced maps if they're not symetric, than if they are"
12:15 <@matricks> Obani: yes, but a map can be too balanced towards defence for example
12:16 < Obani> True
12:16 <@matricks> not enough weapons, too much armor etc are all balance questions
12:16 <@matricks> making it equal for both teams doesn't make a good balanced map
12:16 < Obani> So make it be balanced = attack not too hard, defence not too hard, and at the same level for both sides ?
12:17 <@matricks> well, it should be balanced :D
12:17 < Obani> lol so that's all ? x)
12:17 < Obani> ok
12:17 < Obani> I won't flood the GitHub :p
12:18 <@matricks> defending shouldn't be impossible, but it shouldn't be impossible to attack
12:18 <@matricks> it's a balance :)
12:18 <@matricks> and it's affected by a lot of things, like pickups, choke points, routes, ease of movement etc
12:19 <@matricks> putting the flag in a room with only one narrow exit and loads of grades in the map == bad balance
12:19 < Obani> yes
12:20 <@matricks> and too open and too much health and armor on the map with little weapons makes it too easy to attack
12:20 <@matricks> oh well, time for me to move
12:21 < Obani> ok
17:14 < Obani> Sonix-, edited the reply
19:23 < Obani> Sonix-, you're on IRC and you still use the forum to talk
19:25 < Obani> matricks minus heinrich5991: why wouldn't you add a bot which allows to tell someone something later ?
19:25 <@matricks> oih45t6qwo'ir5ejt
19:25 <@matricks> don't scare me
19:27 < Obani> ?
19:28 < Obani> a bot would be very useful, especially for when there would be action on Github
19:28 <@minus> that existed
19:29 < Obani> on this channel ?
19:29 <@minus> it's actually still enabled
19:33 < Edible> i actually have a bot that does that
19:33 < Edible> its running on another channel on this server
19:45 < rand> #teeworlds-dev ?
19:46 <@minus> nah, it's set to post here
19:46 <@minus> might be the channel modes preventing it
19:46 < EastByte> interesting, still people in teeworlds-dev
22:15 < Inedible> botnik, ?
