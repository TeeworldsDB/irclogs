10:17 <@minus> firefox 29 now. looks almost the same. for some reason i still have the status bar. that's good
14:27 < DAFT> Thats not teeworlds related
14:32 <@minus> but i'm teeworlds-related
15:02 < Learath2> minus: what did you do to it
18:10 <@minus> i have an @ in front of my nick
18:12 < Learath2> thats quite obv
18:12 < Learath2> i was talking abt what you did to your ff
18:14 <@minus> did nothing
20:47 < heinrich5991> matricks: have you considered caching the rendering of whole strings?
20:53 <@minus> that would make sense
20:54 < BeaR_> aren't we already caching the glyphs?
20:55 <@minus> but rendering each glyph independently still is a lot of work
20:58 < BeaR_> as long as we dont need to change the glyphtexture, it shouldn't matter
21:01 < BeaR_> text drawcalls just need to be batched better, as the texture gets changed twice each call to TextEx()
22:10 < heinrich5991> uh why?
22:10 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: ^
22:10 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: what do you mean (:?
22:10 < heinrich5991> where are the texture changes?
22:11 < BeaR_> 1. texture change when rendering the outline and 2. texture changes when switching font size
22:12 < BeaR_> 2nd one applies to multiple TextEx() calls
22:17 < heinrich5991> k
22:26 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: so 'only twice' per string?
22:42 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: yes
