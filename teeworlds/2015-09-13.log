00:00 < heinrich5991> BotoX: http://ref.x86asm.net/coder32.html
00:00 < heinrich5991> it's really helpful
00:00 < BotoX> IDA has comments :p
00:00 < BotoX> auto comment function
00:00 < BotoX> ah okay the opcodes
00:00 < BotoX> https://p.botox.bz/zabu.cpp
00:01 < BotoX> signature scanning using the opcodes
00:01 < BotoX> ? are things that change when the program gets updated
00:02 < heinrich5991> ah
00:02 < BotoX> also yeah, this dumps all netvars: https://p.botox.bz/esew
00:02 < BotoX> so I don't have to look for the offsets myself anymore
00:03 < BotoX> for the networked variables at lest
00:03 < BotoX> (which is a lot in source)

03:38 < heinrich5991> anyone know what could cause this effect?
03:39 < heinrich5991> http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/423692186784409264/7EEE3D1DEB90C971DA719319D0F8A497EDC21816/
03:39 < heinrich5991> this is that guy's config
03:39 < heinrich5991> (really weird rendering, almost looks like a tileset without dilate (or was it borderfix (?))
03:41 < fstd> reminds me of un-borderfix'ed rendering, too.  but i think the rest (including non-tiles) wouldn't be so blurry
03:41 < fstd> same when he disables or reduces or power-of-two's the FSAA setting?
03:45 < heinrich5991> for me the graphics show fine when having fsaa 6. should I still suggest him to try that?
03:47 < heinrich5991> fstd: ^
03:49 < fstd> i think it can't hurt to try it
03:49 < fstd> after all, FSAA is all about blurring, although not as much
03:51 < fstd> (and it's done in hardware, so there's a chance something his libsdl or video driver is buggy)
04:15 < heinrich5991> matricks: perhaps you recognize what might be wrong in these pictures? ^
07:34 <@matricks> heinrich5991: looks like low texture resolution
07:34 <@matricks> heinrich5991: can be caused by driver settings
07:36 <@matricks> heinrich5991: but the font is nice...
20:03 < BotoX> oh man v5 = *(_DWORD *)((*(int (__cdecl **)(int))(*(_DWORD *)a1 + 68))(a1) + 8);

22:42 < MertenNor> hi
22:44 <@matricks> no
22:44 <@minus> de
22:46 < Fels> oink
22:47 <@matricks> pig
22:53 < MertenNor> would it be possible to get Teeworlds to work with the Oculus Rift ?
22:53 < Fels> makes no sense
22:53 <@matricks> without code changes? no
22:54 < heinrich5991> what does that mean? isn't oculus rift just for 3D games?
22:54 < MertenNor> Fels: why? you tried ? xD
22:54 < Fels> why would you use a rift for a 2d game?
22:54 < Fels> that makes no sense.
22:54 <@matricks> heinrich5991: well, teeworlds has layers
22:55 < heinrich5991> you mean like putting the map background behind the map?
22:55 <@matricks> yeah, there are already several parallax layer there so
22:55 <@matricks> but teeworlds uses.. hm..
22:56 < MertenNor> heinrich5991: na would be cool to test it out.. you could just separate the the background and foreground layers so that they are spaced from each other I think it would look Awesome!
22:56 <@matricks> does tw use the depth buffer? I can't remembers
22:56 <@matricks> I think it does
22:56 <@matricks> if I remember correctly, it renders front-to-back and then back-to-front
22:57 < Savander> roftl, oculus + teeworlds
22:57 < Savander> == death
22:58 < MertenNor> wonder if I could make a image or something that you can view with the Rift and google cardboard as a concept thing..
22:58 <@matricks> it's not as weird as it sounds
22:58 <@matricks> ofcause
22:59 <@minus> i keep wondering how a VR headset would improve dev efficiency, instead of having a couple large monitors
22:59 <@matricks> minus: VR is the end of monitors in general when their resolution becomes high enough
22:59 <@matricks> "end of"
23:00 < heinrich5991> just like books were killed by television? :)
23:00 <@matricks> heinrich5991: still gonna be applications for them but well
23:01 < heinrich5991> yea. like for informational screens or so. you don't wanna put on a headset for that :)
23:01 <@matricks> I wonder how highres that VR set needs to be, havn't done the calculations for it
23:01 < MertenNor> I think Ill make something in unity just with some screenshots of the different layers and make it 3D and look at it in the rift.. 
23:01 < MertenNor> ^ starting tomorrow
23:10 < MertenNor> going to bed.. Cya guys another day! :)
23:10 < MertenNor> its by B day today.. lol 
23:11 < MertenNor> 23 yearls and I feel old xD
23:11 <@matricks> lol
23:11 <@matricks> youngling
23:12 < MertenNor> haha XD
23:12 <@minus> plot twist: matricks is 24
23:12 <@matricks> I'm almost a decade older :)
23:12 <@minus> or at least he wishes so
23:13 <@matricks> btw, got a nice picture
23:14 <@matricks> minus: http://www.flightlog.org/fl_b5/flimg.html?id=73248
23:14 < heinrich5991> MertenNor: happy birthday :)
23:14 < MertenNor> heinrich5991:  Thanks :)
23:15 <@minus> matricks: HEY, THAT'S MY HOUSE DOWN THERE
23:15 <@matricks> :P
23:15 <@minus> not quite though, higher mountains here
23:16 <@matricks> not as I as those I'm around now though :)
23:16 <@matricks> I'm in the dolomites right now
23:17 <@minus> hwo often are you even on vacation
23:17 <@matricks> this year? 4
23:17 <@matricks> 7 weeks
23:17 <@minus> madness
23:18 <@matricks> next year might be a bit more
23:21 <@matricks> now, sleepy time
23:22 <@minus> indeed
23:22 <@minus> vacation is over, work tomorrow
