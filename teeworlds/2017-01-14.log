13:06 < Obani> Are some people interested in good quality fng and zombie maps ?
13:06 < Obani> (bModInf zombie mod especially)
13:07 < necropotame> InfClass?
13:08 < Obani> necropotame, I could
13:08 < Obani> necropotame, also, if you want, I can't make your maps be proper
13:08 < Obani> can*
13:08 < Obani> (tired)
13:09 < EastByte> I also can't do that
13:09 < Obani> too late I corrected this
13:09 < EastByte> oh sorry, I'm horribly delayed
13:09 < Obani> necropotame, some of your maps have problems with details for example
13:09 < Obani> Or tiny other things
13:10 < Obani> I made some maps for bmodinf, and am maybe gonna restart making maps for teeworlds
13:10 < necropotame> Obani, I'm reworking on all of them to fix this bugs
13:10 < Obani> I also made fng maps
13:13 < necropotame> I'm always interested by new maps for InfClass :) If the tileset is not ugly and the map balanced, it's fine for me
13:13 < Obani> I only use tileset I got
13:13 < Obani> And for now
13:13 < Obani> It means default
13:13 < Obani> But I prefer making maps for bmoding
13:13 < Obani> bmodinf*
13:14 < necropotame> It's better if you use the TeeUniverse editor, but it's not an obligation. If you want, you can add moving death tiles on InfClass maps, they works
13:14 < necropotame> I understand
13:16 < necropotame> For bInfBMod, you should contact Keep
13:18 < Obani> necropotame, maps are already on his server :)
13:18 < Obani> https://github.com/MinetestForFun/xorhub-serverscontents/tree/master/SRV-FPS/teeworlds/TeeWorlds_infclass/data/maps
13:22 < necropotame> The name of this repository is confusing :P
13:22 < Obani> Yes :/
13:22 < necropotame> I will check them and see
13:28 < necropotame> Summer have nice ideas (left!). Is it okay if I take some parts for infc_warehouse? You will be credited :)
13:28 < Obani> No
13:28 < Obani> I mean
13:29 < Obani> Yes
13:31 < necropotame> lol
17:54 < luca> What does a UDP Package looks like if I want to send a Chat message?
17:54 < luca> So is it possible to send a Chat message via Java?
17:55 < luca> I made a short code for sending an UDP via Datagram to a Server, but how can I send a Chat message?
18:25 <@matricks> Fin: it's.. it's not that simple
18:34 <@heinrich5991> Fin: the easiest (and hacky way) would be to record the client connecting to a server, and sending a message
18:34 <@heinrich5991> then just replace the text you sent with something else
18:35 < EastByte> but chat messages are vital, thus, they rely on ack/seq and stuff
18:35 <@heinrich5991> yes, but everything in vanilla teeworlds is replayable
18:35 <@heinrich5991> ddnet fixed that, so you won't be able to send chat messages to ddnet servers with that
19:16 < quatria> right now the masterservers only send me about 220 servers, normally its more than 900
19:17 < quatria> its a shame so many servers get lost
19:18 < quatria> how about making the client so it remembers servers, so it creates its own file where it saves all servers that it get from the masterservers
19:18 < quatria> if a server on the list is not reachable for lets say 2 month, it will be deleted
19:22 <@matricks> it's kinda what the favvorites are for, but yeah, you could cache the servers as well
19:22 < necropotame> quatria, here the list of all servers as favorite
19:22 < necropotame> https://chickenmilk.rocks/serverlist.php
19:22 <@matricks> but.. that causes some issues with a lot of clients unnessesary spamming ip addresses that doesn't have a server
19:22 <@matricks> quatria: more intressting is why the servers disappeared
19:22 < quatria> similar to favorites, but not the same, i dont want to have all servers in my favourite list :P
19:23 < quatria> matricks i agree its better to fix that, but thats not in my power :)
19:23 < necropotame> It's a workaround ^^ don't expect something new in  vanilla
19:23 <@matricks> quatria: could be that a master went down, then it takes a couple of minutes to rebalance everything
19:23 <@matricks> could be a netsplit, then it's hard to fix
19:25 <@matricks> If I were todo that system now, I would probably make all masters keep a complete list of all servers
19:25 < quatria> necropotame thx for the list but i have a list too, its just that i dont want to add them all to my favorites, since that causes my real favorites (your servers :P) to load slower
19:30 < quatria> matricks about the spamming ips that dont have servers, the client could remember that the ip stopped having a server and then spamm less or delete the server from the list
19:30 <@matricks> quatria: for a while yes
19:30 <@matricks> but I agree that it could perhaps be cached a bit more
19:30 < quatria> so if someone would make a pr that contains a cache system you think it would be accepted?
19:30 <@matricks> dunno, I'm not really connected to the project anymore
19:30 < quatria> a client based
19:33 < quatria> wait, matricks are you the creator of teeworlds? ^^
19:33 <@matricks> more or less
19:33 < quatria> nice game :)
20:03 < necropotame> I think Henningstone made some kind of PR for that
20:08 < quatria> i looked at his pr's dont see anything like that
20:10 < necropotame> Mhh, it's not a PR, but the code is done ^^ https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1154
20:11 < quatria> thanks
20:13 < necropotame> If it's not the case, it should be done for DDNet client. There is more chance that it will be accepted, and you will not have to wait for TW 0.7 in 2084
20:14 <@matricks> necropotame: 2084 seems optimistic
20:14 <@matricks> ;)
20:14 < necropotame> :D
21:07 <@heinrich5991> matricks: if you were to do that system now, each server would register to all master servers, and clients would connect to a) all master servers as well or b) only one master server
21:21 <@matricks> heinrich5991: all masters
21:21 <@matricks> heinrich5991: and get the list from all of them
21:21 <@heinrich5991> and simply merge the lists? ok :)
21:21 <@matricks> yap
21:21 <@matricks> more robust, less scaleable
21:22 <@matricks> but scaleable smaleable
