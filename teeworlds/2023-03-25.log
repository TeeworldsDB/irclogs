22:40 < minus> kinda considering slapping teeworlds.com into a docker container and just throwing that somewhere
22:40 < minus> on the other hand i don't really give a fuck
22:47 <@heinrich5991> what would the docker container improve?
22:49 < minus> would avoid having an OS to update
22:51 < minus> assuming a) an database is available externally b) a maintained environment to run the container in is available
22:53 < minus> the machine it runs on now is basically unmaintained with an unsupported version of debian
