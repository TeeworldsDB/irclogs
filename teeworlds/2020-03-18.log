00:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think the idea with the custom entities and weapons that can be embedded into maps might be cool.
01:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it is bad enough that there is ninja already :/
01:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> worst weapon
01:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> > "(not for vanilla ofc)"
01:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh?
11:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> You can always choose not to put the powerup in the map, I don't see how it is "bad" that there is ninja in the game
12:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yea i mean in general i also have the opinion to put everything in and make it optional so every user/mapper/admin can craft his own version. But regarding vanilla i would like to keep away things that mess with the flow of this perfect game. Becuase if they get added they are likley to end up in standard maps and there will be bunch of versions hosted containing powerups and maybe noobs enjoy it so there is no other server wi
12:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Its like infinite hook reach on zCatch servers. I remember times were noobs were dominating all zCatch servers and so people were forced to play with a abused hook. Something like that can be fun for a moment but fun for a moment is more a mod than a vanilla thing imo. The base game is very solid and it would be sad to change it.

12:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> And ninja is already a abandoned weapon in competetive games. Why invest time in powerups that do not add to long time player expirence if we have so many other critical things on the issue list.
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> That ninja isn't strong enough for competitive doesn't mean it's bad for Teeworlds. Teeworlds isn't all about the dozens of folks that decided to make it a competitive thing
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> If it's fun, it's good by my book :)
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> teeworlds is a game, games are for fun, ninja is fun, where problem?
