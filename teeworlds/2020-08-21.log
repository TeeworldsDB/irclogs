02:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> can we do something about the wrong prediction in 0.7?
02:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if i hook a tee the hookpos is so false
02:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> even noticable on good ping
02:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> only on 0.7 clints
02:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> only on 0.7 clients
02:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> there is no prediction for other tees in 0.7
02:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> and when you are hooking someone else the client just uses the hook pos from the server
02:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> does it happen on all servers?
02:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
02:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> otherwise i guess the server is just sending a wrong hook pos
02:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/751bfb92b313e336819b362429a971db8d6e67df/src/game/client/components/players.cpp#L107
02:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nop
02:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> for 0.6 clients it works
02:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> no prediction involved here. it just uses the pos from the server
02:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no
02:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> the character order doesnt match the servers' one
02:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thats the issue in 0.7
02:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thats why this is happening
02:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oy said something like that iirc
02:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> that atleast makes sense to me and explains the weird behaviour
02:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> that was just the same in 0.6
02:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nop
03:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i dont know the cause but there is a bug, i know it
03:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> it was. snapshot diffs have no clue about the order
03:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> ddnet has additional code for the order but 0.6 never had
03:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> look
03:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> try to join a server with 0.7 vanilla client (can also be vanilla server), preferable high ping, then hook players and drag them through the air
03:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> you will notice the hook pos doesnt match the character pos at all time
03:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> then try it with ddnet client, there its butter smooth in the center of the tee, always.
03:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> can also try it out on bridge servers, as its really just a clientside thing
03:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> it's wrong until the server tells you about the hook. same in 0.6. seems like ddnet fixed that
03:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> in ddnet it's a side effect of the antiping implementation
03:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> the vanilla code mixes predicted and unpredicted values
03:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @fokkonaut try this https://github.com/axblk/teeworlds/tree/cleanup_prediction
03:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> will test it tomorrow
03:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> üëç
03:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but i am 100% sure this wasnt the case in 0.6
03:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> like also not in vanilla 0.6
03:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> will test that too tomorrow
03:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> just tested it in 0.6. same as 0.7
03:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> that code actually didn't change between versions
03:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> lol
03:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so it actually was always buggy?
03:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Yes. It checks the unpredicted value for whether you are hooking someone. So the client still thinks your hook is in the air. Then it uses the predicted position of the hook, which is already pulling the other tee back.
03:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
03:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Actually you cannot use the predicted hook position at all when you are hooking someone, as the position of the other tee is not predicted. You need to use the unpredicted position of the tee as hook position
04:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> How does ddnet handle it then
04:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> lol
