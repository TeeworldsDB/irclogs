10:59 < ChillerDragon> @d_une how is the letter to oy going?
11:00 < ChillerDragon> there are 42 open prs. The build proccess is full of warnings. The CI is failing. The project is dead.
11:10 < bridge_> <d_une> ChillerDragon: not happening in the near future. Feel free to mandate someone else
11:43 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 sos pinger oy pls
12:59 < bridge_> <jxsl13> @mtrcks SoS
20:19 < nev> this always happens
20:20 < nev> what is the point of a <distributed> vcs if people still use it like a centralized vcs?
21:49 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Always happens?
21:51 < bridge_> <chillerdragon> Having 10 forks of tw that no one uses is a waste of time for the maintainers of them. They won’t be released on teeworlds.com or steam or in package managers. They won’t be found by new contributors on GitHub.
23:49 < nev> so decide who has the role of mantainer or make a group
23:51 < nev> that's closed development. Of course closed development dies
23:58 < minus> hey nev did you just play overwatch against me
23:58 < nev> nope
23:59 < bridge_> <stiopa> The chances of that happening seem low. Sounds like it would NEVer happen ;)
