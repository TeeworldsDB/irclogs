11:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> this guy seems to run around on gh and put his issue everywhere xd
12:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @jxsl13 there is a tutorial
18:09 < rand> server zcatch 89.163.204.53:8303, can anyone connect ?
18:19 < rand> it is back, but everyone changed server
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> apparently it was down due to loss of owner ðŸ˜® fixed the bug, finally
18:43 < rand> \o/
18:44 < rand> which owner ? from the crash kill fix ?
18:44 < rand> well, it occured on another server xD
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah, the merge didn't go that smoothly there and I had accessed an array with a negative index there. But it should be fixed
18:47 < rand> was it a loop on all the integers ?
18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Oo? it was a check on post mortem kills, where getting the owner pointer from the array was done with a negative index.
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you know what's fun, that I get updated builds on every commit ðŸ˜„
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and ppl can just download the executable(cough, windows not included, cough end)
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ðŸ˜®
18:50 < rand> in case the server did not crash, that could be this, since the server hangs, that's almost the same for clients
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD rip
18:52 < rand> it seems
19:18 < rando> ddos is strong tonight
21:30 < rand> are the last issue about bug or ddos ? (on zcatch/insta servers)
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> zcatch might be bug, but not sure
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xould be ddos as well, dunno
