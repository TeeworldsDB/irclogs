16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> I am glad you are so impressed with teeworlds quakenet. Hello
17:33 < ChillerDragon> xd
17:34 < ChillerDragon> Yo can someone explain me what the alternative snap is for? Why not just use the normal snap? Speaking of m_pAltSnap in the snapshot holder 
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the altsnap is the one the client modifies
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it needs to keep the original snap for reconstructing newer snapshots from deltas
18:12 < ChillerDragon> ah i see
18:12 < ChillerDragon> modifying is only invalidating items and deleting them right?
22:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in vanilla, yes
