18:42 < bridge> [freenode] <juan_> Hello! I'm a big fan of this game and I want to make an opensource 3D version of teeworlds. My question is the following: Is Teeworlds a trade mark? Because I would like to call my game Teeworlds 3D in honor to the original
18:53 < minus> it's not a trademark
18:53 < minus> unless matricks secretly filed one
19:19 < bridge> [freenode] <juan_> Ok thanks
20:13 <@matricks> juan_: 3d in what sence?
