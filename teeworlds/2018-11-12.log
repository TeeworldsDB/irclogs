15:26 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> hello
15:26 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> 0.7 servers always empty :/
15:26 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> and i think the refresh from servers list is not working properly
15:27 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> because sometimes it shows 1/3 of servers, then show different results etc
15:27 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> is not "consistent" if that makes sense
15:54 < rand> you're right, same here
15:55 < rand> but I didn't figure out if it' cause by master servers request or servers info requests
15:57 < rand> but tw_api.py seems fineâ€¦
15:57 < rand> might be a client issue
19:45 <@Dune> should bump this issue somewhere rand
19:54 <@Dune> it's gotta be a masterserver thing because favorites always load for me
20:22 < rand> sometimes, I don't get answer from servers
20:23 < rand> it may be my connection that is pretty fluctuent those days
20:24 < rand> oh no, sometimes, I miss the answer of one master server

23:02 < guenstig_werben> hi @minus, i've been talking to Dune a bit about having some official nightlys (basically build for every commit ideally linked on the downloads page, and i've been wondering whether we could together implement something like that. steps are simple, 1. set up a github webhook to notify about every push to master or whatever,
23:03 < guenstig_werben> 2. a minimalistic callback endpoint on one of the official servers using whatever stack you are using (have done that a few times already) checking token and invoking a single shell script (as a different user, please) which compiles the binary and replaces the resulting binary (if compilation succeeds) with the one currently hosted. put a fixed link in the downloads page and done
23:03 < guenstig_werben> at which point you could even also host some servers which are also automatically restarted once a new nightly is up there
23:04 < guenstig_werben> (i.e. call them reference servers). i'd like to hear your opinion about those, will be offline here but reading the chat through discord
23:04 <@Dune> I believe @fisico would be greatly interested in the idea of automatically updated servers
23:04 < minus> sounds like a nice idea
23:04 < guenstig_werben> oh hi
23:05 < minus> we did have automatic builds years ago
23:05  * Dune remembers
23:05  * guenstig_werben did it 5 times independently from each other xD
23:05 <@Dune> 0.6 trunk builds
23:05 < guenstig_werben> wondering where these running off the server behind teeworlds.com?
23:06 < minus> (automatic builds, but not servers)
23:06 < minus> dunno where those builds ran
23:06 <@heinrich5991> nah
23:07 <@heinrich5991> these days you'd do builds on the CI servers
23:07 < guenstig_werben> yeah whatever
23:07 <@heinrich5991> they usually provide a way to store artifacts
23:07 < minus> that's what we did; buildbot is CI
23:07 < guenstig_werben> they do?
23:07 < guenstig_werben> idk
23:07 <@heinrich5991> yes, but without having to host our own servers :)
23:07 < guenstig_werben> cool, go for it hen
23:07 < minus> a service is nicer ofc
23:08 < guenstig_werben> i just never used them, because didnt wanna pay for nonpublic stuff xD
23:08 <@heinrich5991> yea, ddnet already has it. we could copy from there I guess
23:08 < guenstig_werben> go ahead please do it
23:11 < minus> send CI configs :D
23:11 < guenstig_werben> apart from that, any future plans for discord guys? maybe this (https://discordapp.com/verification) or this (https://discordapp.com/rich-presence; its free software by the way) or anything further than that? (have a little bit of experience and contact to the discord peeps so i'd be helping with implementing something after we discussed it and deemed it appropriate)
23:12 < minus> guenstig_werben: i've seen you've PMed me before various times; be advised that i ignore PMs if it's just a 'hello'
23:13 < guenstig_werben> sorry, i dont know about previosu times
23:13 < guenstig_werben> this time i switched over to public chat after a few seconds of thinking xD
23:13 < minus> :D
23:13 < guenstig_werben> please forgive me, its late :)
23:13 < minus> well, just letting you know why you didn't get a reply
23:14 < guenstig_werben> hehe
23:14 <@Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=rules/irc_rules
23:14 < guenstig_werben> as if i'd read something like that hehe
23:14 < guenstig_werben> but thanks dune <3
23:15 < guenstig_werben> after all i'm not so much the irc dude. i dont quite like the persistence hehe
23:16 < guenstig_werben> anyway, any input on those links i've sent? just some overall guts feeling would be appreciated
23:16 < guenstig_werben> minus, dune, heinrich, whatever
23:16 < minus> if you ask me, discord belongs in only one place
23:16 < minus> and that's the trash can
23:17 < guenstig_werben> good :)
23:17 < guenstig_werben> i like that opinion and i understand it. however the same applies for irc hehe
23:18 < guenstig_werben> good night ^^
23:18 <@Dune> which communication channel would you suggest then?
23:18 < minus> hey, irc survived for 30 years already
23:19 <@Dune> IRC is finnish, so it's designed to be silent
23:19 < minus> :D
23:19 < minus> it does have its shortcomings
23:19 < minus> night
23:22 <@Dune> https://xkcd.com/949/
23:23 <@Dune> how's XDCC not there
23:24 < minus> It does mention direct connect
