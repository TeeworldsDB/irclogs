17:18 < bridge> [freenode] <minus> wanna just dispose of this channel here? with freenode now being part of the league of evil and all
17:19 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> hehe, mentioned the same thing over at #ddnet
17:19 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> I guess we should add a viable method for matrix users to join
17:23 < bridge> [freenode] <minus> isn't matrix bridged to quakenet already?
17:23 < rand> it is
17:23 < bridge> [freenode] <minus> there's just 8 people here on freenode, most if which probably also are on quakenet
17:23 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irx/issues/208 says otherwise
17:23 < bridge> [freenode] <minus> 404
17:24 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/208
17:24 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> I should get better at typing links :P
17:24 < bridge> [freenode] <minus> why would you type links
17:24 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> this time, because the IRC client and web browser I used are on different computers
17:25 < bridge> [freenode] <minus> otherwise, a matrix bridge for libera.chat is in the works i think i heard
17:25 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> let's pull the plug once that bridge is online?
17:25 < bridge> [freenode] <minus> sure
17:25 < bridge> [freenode] <minus> not that there's much plug pulling to do anyway, since no one has ops or owns the channel
17:25 < bridge> [freenode] <minus> i'll just /part again
17:26 <@heinrich5991> the plug would be the bridge
17:29 < minus> fair point
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what's the league of evil
17:43 < rand> capitalism
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> tell me more
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> they want money?
17:47 < rand> sure, but they also have money
17:47 < rand> and lawyer

21:52 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> such walls of text
21:52 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> any tldr? lol nice minus and heinrich on matrix ;)
21:54 < minus> i'm not on matrix
21:54 < minus> well, technically i did make an account on matrix.org, but matrix sucks
21:57  * bridge [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> uploaded an image: (38KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/mVeySOQewFkFURVJfUUMuYai/image.png >
21:57 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oh then the bridge got fancier
21:58 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i probably still cant send images can i?
21:58 < ChillerDragon> oh it works nice
21:58 < ChillerDragon> bro why is this so laggy
22:19 < minus> matrix? matrix is laggy by design
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> more details pls
23:00 < minus> j/k, not sure about the design (it uses http requests afaik?), the matrix.org instance definitely is slow (due to its size; a similar size is no problem for irc)
