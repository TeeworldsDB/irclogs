10:46 < bridge> [freenode] <EastCharlie> Excuse me .. any message about recent attack on 0.6.4 servers? O.O
10:47 <@Dune> EastCharlie, 0.6 is vulnerable, not much we can do except promote 0.7 more
10:49 < bridge> [freenode] <EastCharlie> Thx...
11:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its not that people dont know about 0.7...
11:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @ChillerDragon Then why are they on 0.6?
11:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its because they prefer it
11:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i know many people miss ddnet in 0.7
11:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i personally miss support for my hardware in 0.7
11:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i think everybody knows that 0.7 is out
11:34 <@Dune> 7 years of content on 0.6, it's that simple to me
11:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yep
11:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but also content creators wont join 0.7 and do stuff if they screen resoluion is not supported or mouse input is different
11:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Is that really the case for most people though?
11:38 <@Dune> I think people with hardware problems on 0.7 are a minority
11:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i dont know
11:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I get that you are having issues
11:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> but I bet most don't
11:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i can talk only for my self but i also hear complains here and there but nothing bullet proof
12:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I just tested ddnet and 0.7 on a bunch of devices and screens it is very tricky to tell how smooth it runs when being so used to a specific screen. But i guess mousesense should be fine.
12:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ay btw this inp_grab 1 would it finally solve the problem with switching os that you can never reproduce the ms. I am bound to windows because i cant reproduce my ms on linux or macOS. So if you get used to inp_grab 1 it would be os independent and you have same sense everywhere?
12:26 <@Dune> maybe, but I suspect there could be other parameters than the acceleration
12:27 <@Dune> I mean different OS = different drivers right
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ya like my razer mice usually have some dpi settings that depend on some razer software that doesnt run good on macOS and worse on linux
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but still it would be one step into the right direction i guess
19:26 < Assa> @Oy, your review is wrongly formatted and i don't know what you mean
19:26 < Assa> Blend has the value 0.5
19:30 < Assa> I could change line 792 from if(BufferedMode) TextRender()->TextColor(1, 1, 1, 0.5f); to TextRender()->TextColor(1, 1, 1, Blend);
19:31 < Assa> because Blend has value 0.5, if the chat is Buffered and otherwise it has value 1.0
19:36 < Oy> Assa: it was a duplicate call. there was TextRender()->TextColor(1, 1, 1, Blend); and some lines later TextRender()->TextColor(1, 1, 1, 0.5f);
19:36 < Oy> but seems fixed now
19:47 < Assa> my github bugged a bit
19:50 < Oy> Assa: you didn't get my note about the width. It's not the number of characters but the rendering width 
19:58 <@Dune> Assa, I guess you meant my comment's formatting bugged out, not oy's
20:05 < Assa> oh, you are right Dune ^^ it was oys review but your comment
20:05 < Assa> how do I determine the width of a text? And i got an idea: make each dot of "..." more transparent "fade out"
20:06 <@Dune> I think it's fine the way it is ^^'
20:06 <@Dune> float TextWidth(
20:08 < Assa> It is fine now, next time I do a screenshot :D
20:11 < Assa> the last problem, how do i render text with a specific text width
20:11 < Assa> wait i know
20:26 < Assa> what is the difference between "size" and "linewidth" in the Text() function (src/engine/client/text.cpp)
20:27 < Assa> and why are you sending unused pointers sometimes oO
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> `Size` sounds like font size (height) and `LineWidth` like the width for the whole text
20:32 < Assa> okay, now i understand why fontsize 198 breaks everything
20:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
20:37 < Oy> that textrender has some hidden traps
20:38 < Assa> setting the Linewidth to Widthlimit doesn't make the line shorter oO
20:39 < barsik> sup guys
20:41 < Oy> your current widthlimit is sth else
20:44 < Assa> found out that i forgot to change the font size when calling textWidth
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yo party people
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i fixed windows high dpi support
21:11 <@heinrich5991> cool :)
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but my is ignored by teeworlds*
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> :c
21:11 < Assa> nice :thumbsup
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well i just stole it from ddnet -.-
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and Juppey told me how to stea xd
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DnP38/6ad5ebc890.png
21:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i created the files teeworlds.manifest and teeworlds.rc but the gitignore teeworlds* ignores them
21:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> any idea what to do?
21:12 < Assa> what why do you want a manifest in the first place?
21:12 < Assa> easy solution: change the .gitigore file?
21:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the manifest fixes highdpi for windows
21:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> if i remove the star from teeworlds it would probably track a bunch of binarys
21:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i could also rename the manifest but idk tw.manifest sounds bad
21:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> !teeworlds.manifest
21:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in gitignore
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ya baby
21:14 < Assa> you can define exception in the gitignore
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> thats what i wanted ðŸ˜ƒ
21:14 < Assa> @heinrich is smart
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> any specific place for that?
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> top bottom?
21:14 < Assa> probably under teeworlds*?
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> undert teeworlds*
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> below the teeworlds* thing I thnk
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yup
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> k
21:24 < barsik> how make chat command which takes myfancyint?
21:24 < Assa> parse string to int?
21:25 < barsik> i think yep
21:26 < barsik> if im write /int 1 myfancyint take 1
21:27 < Assa> @Oy @Dune i have a recursive problem: How do I get the width of a string, which i don't know the chars of, because i have limited it already to a width
21:27 < Assa> looks like TextWidth again
21:36 < Assa> doesn't work
21:36 < barsik> or what
21:36 < Assa> write "/int 42"
21:36 < barsik> xd
21:37 < Assa> do char* +=5;
21:37 < Oy> Assa: what do u want to do?
21:37 < Assa> do atoi *text
21:37 < Assa> I want the width of a string, with a given width limit
21:37 < Oy> don't get it
21:37 < Assa> if I write "WWWWWWWWWW" and limit it to 42, only 17 Ws are printed
21:38 < Assa> thus the actual length is smaller then the maximum length
21:38 < Assa> thus i always get a small space between text and the dots
21:38 < Assa> Do you understand my problem?
21:39 < Assa> I want the actual width of a width-limited string
21:40 < Oy> use a CTextCursor  and call TextEx()
21:40 < Oy> it keeps the position
21:41 < Assa> but i can't limit the width with textex
21:42 < Oy> cursor.m_linewidth
21:42 < Assa> AHHH
21:43 < Oy> and set Cursor.m_Flags |= TEXTFLAG_STOP_AT_END so it doesn't do multiple lines
21:49 < barsik> can anyone help me? please?
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> idk what u want exactly barsik
21:54 < Assa> @Oy @Dune I finally did it...
21:55 < Assa> I feel so nerdy right now - Implementing features for an open source project after a long pathfinder session while watching Star Trek
21:58 < barsik> ints*
21:58 < barsik> int*
21:58 < barsik> Discord harry up
21:58 < barsik>  i want to make chat command which take myfancyint into ints SpreadCmd
21:59 < Assa> google C string to integer pls
22:00 < barsik> oh okey
22:06 <@Dune> alternatively just look at how teeworlds does it for console commands :)
22:21 < Assa> @Dune is there a way to add a command, that calls a function on change?
22:21 < Assa> I still don't understand how server commands or votes work
22:21 <@Dune> on change of what
22:22 <@Dune> well just ctrl+f one server command
22:22 < Assa> on variable change
22:22 <@Dune> no
22:22 <@Dune> commands are not variables
22:25 < Assa> maybe thats the problem
22:25 < Assa> i should turn a variable into a custom command
22:43 <@heinrich5991> Assa: if you need notifications on change, check out Console()->Chain()
22:46 < Assa> perfect, thank you ^^
22:47 < Assa> sv_scorelimit is a variable, too
22:51 < Oy> there should already be a chain in place for it
22:52 < Oy> clients get notified when the settings change
22:56 < Assa> i think i don't need the callback
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yo @Dune i think you asked for reasons to not upgrade to 0.7 one player mentioned that he cant update because vanilla client has no good antiping like ddnet does
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im not sure if this is on a todo somewhere
23:19 <@Dune> I'm not the one who asked ^^
23:20 <@Dune> to me it's clear, it's just years of content
23:45 <@Dune> didn't know Console()->Chain() works on variables
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it works on all commands, and variables are only special commands
23:55 < Assa> I used Console()->Register
23:55 < Assa> and removed the variable entirely
