18:55 < day> i saw someone with his nick written in yellow in the scoreboard. he was specing
18:55 < day> what does that mean?
18:56 < day> a few min later his nick was written normally in white
18:57 < rand> he was spectating you
18:57 < day> ah
18:57 < rand> it's meant so that botter can auto disable bot when sby is looking
18:58 < day> kek
18:58 < day> i guess rand does not approve of this feature
18:58 < rand> I learnt that clicking start/stop spec/freeview
18:59 < rand> my auto bot is disabled way too often
19:00 < day> hm that explains your inconsistancy
19:00 < day> kek
19:02 < rand> I think botters will only try to look smart asking why some guys is spectating him after accusations
19:03 < day> do botters even exist in vanilla?
19:03 < day> like i havent met one that could beat me that clearly wasnt better in general
19:04 <@Dune> I guess aim is not that important in vanilla
19:04 < day> and hookbots are useless if you dont know whats going on
19:04 <@Dune> in order to beat you, they'd need to be a pretty regular player and willing to play competitively, and then it's not worth it to cheat 
19:04 < day> yeah
19:04 < rand> I do not remember seeing autoaim in 0.7
19:05 < day> are there nade prediction bots?
19:05 <@Dune> major releases clean up a lot of bullshit :)
19:05 < rand> Dune: aim is important in DM
19:06 <@Dune> I guess you can get a pretty significant advantage with hammer/pistol spam
19:06 < day> doesnt help if the opponent gets all weapons and hearts/shields
19:06 < rand> but, it's less the case in CTF
19:06 <@Dune> yeah, in CTF movement is too important, cheaters will lose regardless
19:06 <@Dune> (I think)
19:06 < day> a good player with aimbot will obviously always beat you
19:06 < rand> that's why I only play ctf :p
19:07 < rand> a tool assisted pro
19:07 < day> like mario
20:27 < Oy> should decide what to do with the bind thing for 0.7.3
20:29 <@heinrich5991> we should just drop the nethash ^^
20:29 <@heinrich5991> it doesn't do any good
20:30 <@heinrich5991> it's the first thing mod developers change
20:32 < Oy> well, it's an indicator that sth might go wrong :)
20:32 <@heinrich5991> yeaâ€¦
20:32 < minus> it's obviously not resilient enough
22:02 <@Dune> I guess it should be a simple warning, somehow?
22:07 < day> did you notice that the railgun ray is frequently not rendered/ invisible?
22:07 <@Dune> railgun?
22:07 <@Dune> ah, laser?
22:07 <@Dune> it seems like there are lost packet issues to me :/ often, the death animation is not played too
22:07 < day> really? :P
22:08 < day> hm
22:09 < day> the death animation not being played ive only experienced on laggy servers
22:09 < day> but the ray issue i see frequently on a rock solid <25ms server
23:24 < day> rand: sooo who do you think is #1? :D
23:38 < day> guess it's not mario after all D:
23:39 < day> well i kind of knew it wasnt him due to his different style. that being said im like 90% sure he has a spinbot :P
