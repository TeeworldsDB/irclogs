00:37 < ghost91> minus: hey, sorry i forgot to tell you earlier
00:37 < ghost91> the tournament is over now
00:38 < ghost91> which means you can now put the video back on the page :)
00:38 < ghost91> thanks for putting the stream there :)
11:11 < JulianAssange> >put donnie darko on blueray disk
11:11 < JulianAssange> >go to ps3 to put it in
11:11 < JulianAssange> >it won't turn on
11:11 < JulianAssange> >mfw ylod
11:11 < JulianAssange> >mfw muh movies
11:47 <@matricks> woot
11:51 <@minus> matricks: autorejoint
11:51 <@matricks> was.. was that a auto rejoin?
11:51 <@matricks> ffs
11:51 <@matricks> YAY BAN HAMMER
11:52 <@minus> that alone should suffice
11:52 <@matricks> suck it
11:52 <@minus> you forgot adding a ", fgt"
11:52 <@matricks> first sargent?
11:53 <@matricks> fine gentleman there?
11:53 <@minus> former
11:53 <@matricks> D:
11:53 <@minus> that sounds good

12:35 < JulianAssange> EastByte: make a client that will rip maps from servers
12:35 < JulianAssange> so i don't have to manually steal them
13:08 < heinrich5991> matricks: do you remember why the client saves the snapshots twice?
13:16 <@matricks> heinrich5991: url?
13:18 < heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L1348 it's created here, the last parameter requests a m_pAltSnap
13:18 < heinrich5991> it's used e.g. here:
13:18 < heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L628
13:21 <@matricks> the alt one is one that can be modified by the game by using SnapInvalidateItem
13:21 <@matricks> the game will removed invalid items from the snapshot due to verification of bounds on integers etc
13:21 < heinrich5991> ah, thank you
13:22 <@matricks> but we need to keep a copy of the original for when we do delta decompression
13:26 <@matricks> you could probably save a bit of memory to make a bitarray for the invalidated items etc
13:26 <@matricks> but this protects against any nasty stuff the game can do as it never gets a pointer to the real snapshot
13:31 < JulianAssange> heinrich5991: make what i told EastByte to make plz
13:31 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: what?
13:43 < JulianAssange> 13:35 < JulianAssange> EastByte: make a client that will rip maps from servers
13:43 < JulianAssange> 13:35 < JulianAssange> so i don't have to manually steal them
13:46 < JulianAssange> i want to run a program to vote for every map in a server
13:51 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: why don't you just code it yourself?
13:52 < heinrich5991> also, gimme the maps afterwards :P
14:11 < JulianAssange> because i have no idea how 2 do it
14:21 <@minus> lrn2teeworlds
14:49 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: do you already have some maps?
14:55 <@minus> heinrich5991: i'd be interested in a map crawler too
14:55 < heinrich5991> minus: me too :D
14:55 < heinrich5991> I already tried to do it once
14:55 <@minus> you implement the connecting & downloading, i can do the rest
14:56 < heinrich5991> minus: k
14:58 <@minus> uhm
14:58 <@minus> async please
14:58 <@minus> i already have an event loop
14:58 <@minus> https://git.mnus.de/cgit/teeworlds_srvbrowse/tree/teeworlds/base.py
14:59 <@minus> wörk wörk
15:00 < heinrich5991> minus: python? I'd do it in C++
15:00 < heinrich5991> you call me with a server, I do the rest
15:00 < heinrich5991> e.g.
15:00 < heinrich5991> ./download_maps 123.45.67.89:8303
15:02 < heinrich5991> minus: ok?
15:34 <@minus> heinrich5991: why C++, can you re-use teeworlds code?
15:34 <@minus> actually re-implementing the downloading code could be used to speed it up, probably
15:34 <@minus> reason for python: cause it works, performance is no issue
15:35 <@minus> sorry, was afk, heinrich5991
15:36 < heinrich5991> minus: because I'd like to reuse TW code, yes
15:37 <@minus> and i'd like a python implementation :D
15:38 <@minus> but sure
16:00 < JulianAssange> how do i 
16:00 < JulianAssange> like
16:00 < JulianAssange> make where a quaf will show up
16:00 < JulianAssange> quad*
16:00 < JulianAssange> when editing a map it's like a red outlining
16:00 < JulianAssange> but how do i make it
16:00 < JulianAssange> oh clipping
16:00 < JulianAssange> ok
16:15 < JulianAssange> is it possible
16:15 < JulianAssange> to delete quads within a range3
16:15 < JulianAssange> so i've got like 50 little monsters as quads, but i want to delete them all
16:15 < JulianAssange> without right clicking each one
16:27 < heinrich5991> ghost91: thanks for the changes in the pull request
16:29 < ghost91> yeah, i hope it’s fine like this now :9
16:29 < ghost91> :)
16:50 < JulianAssange> ugh
16:50 < JulianAssange> how do i make a quaf that moves with you
16:50 < JulianAssange> quad*
16:54 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: parallaxx?
16:54 < JulianAssange> i mean
16:54 < JulianAssange> in teewworlds
16:54 < JulianAssange> teeworlds
16:54 < JulianAssange> in the editor
16:58 <@minus> heinrich5991: coding yet?
16:58 < heinrich5991> minus: yep
16:58 <@minus> yay
16:58 < heinrich5991> trying to get the voting to work
16:58 <@minus> ETA?
16:58 < heinrich5991> map download wokrs
16:58 <@minus> voting?
16:58 < heinrich5991> ETA 1 hour
16:58 < heinrich5991> voting
16:58 < heinrich5991> to get all the maps from the server
16:58 <@minus> voting for different map if noone palys
16:58 <@minus> lol
16:58 < heinrich5991> yes
16:58 <@minus> nice one
16:58 < heinrich5991> minus: btw, only connect to empty servers
16:58 <@minus> ETA til i can get started: 2h
16:58 < JulianAssange> minus: do you know how to make a moving quad, like the background?
16:59 < heinrich5991> I don't wanna servers to get disrupted
16:59 <@minus> downloading occupies slots i assume?
17:04 <@minus> JulianAssange: i do not
17:05 < JulianAssange> damn
17:05 < JulianAssange> i don't think it's possible
17:09 < Learath2> JulianAssange: i remember someone did it 
17:09 < JulianAssange> yeah they did
17:09 < Learath2> he locked it to the center of the camera somehow 
17:09 < Learath2> mmh
17:09 < JulianAssange> im looking into it now
17:09 < Learath2> Delo did it 
17:09 < Learath2> in his totoro map
17:11 <@minus> tutturuu
17:11 < JulianAssange> ugh
17:11 < JulianAssange> this run map im on has it too
17:11 < JulianAssange> but idfk how
17:12 < Learath2> youtube blocked in turkey :P
17:12 < JulianAssange> rofl
17:12 < JulianAssange> really
17:12 < Learath2> yep
17:12 < JulianAssange> is google blocked?
17:12 < Learath2> twitter a couple days ago
17:12 < JulianAssange> yeah i heard about twitter
17:13 < JulianAssange> and i heard they were thinking of doing google
17:13 <@minus> Learath2: want a uncensored DNS server?
17:13 < JulianAssange> an
17:13 < Learath2> well i was using google dns but thats blocked too
17:13 < JulianAssange> sry i had to :<
17:13 < Learath2> it would be awesome
17:14 < Learath2> i just tunnel all my web browsing thru my vps but GEMA is kinda annoying
17:14 <@minus> JulianAssange: right, i decided to use "uncensored" after already having written a
17:15 <@minus> Learath2: there's between 20 and 30 million open recursors on the internet
17:15 <@minus> shouldn't be hard to find
17:15 < Learath2> recursor ?
17:15 <@minus> after scanning about 100 hosts you should've found one
17:15 <@minus> DNS server
17:17 < Learath2> so you are telling me to google for dns servers :P
17:17 < JulianAssange> no
17:17 < JulianAssange> nmap 0.0.0.0/0 -p53
17:21 <@minus> and greet DNS reflection attacks for me
17:21 <@minus> ok, time to head home
17:34 < JulianAssange> heh
17:34 < JulianAssange> Learath2: surprise surprise
17:34 < JulianAssange> the run map im looing at
17:34 < JulianAssange> is made by delo
17:34 < JulianAssange> do u know how to contact him?
17:39 < Learath2> well i have his skype JulianAssange
17:41 < Learath2> well apparently i dont anymore
17:41 < Learath2> should ask Tsin
17:42 < progers> Hello
17:45 < heinrich5991> hello
17:45 < Maimer_> hEllo
17:57 < progers> :)
18:02 < JulianAssange> really weird 
18:02 < JulianAssange> when i append the part
18:02 < JulianAssange> it works
18:02 < JulianAssange> but when i copy it bit by bit it doesn't work ;-;
18:03 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: have you noted the attributes of the game group?
18:03 < JulianAssange> attributes?
18:04 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: layer groups also have attributes, just like layers
18:04 < JulianAssange> like para x / paras y
18:04 < JulianAssange> para y*
18:04 < JulianAssange> clip x, cip y ectc
18:05 < heinrich5991> yes
18:05 < JulianAssange> yes i copied that
18:05 < heinrich5991> k
18:05 < heinrich5991> parallax (para x) is the important part I guess)
18:05 < heinrich5991> -)
18:05 < JulianAssange> what
18:05 < JulianAssange> what does that do
18:12 < JulianAssange> oh wow
18:12 < JulianAssange> i think what he did
18:13 < JulianAssange> was make his background non-moving
18:13 < JulianAssange> and the moving background part was the monsters
18:13 < JulianAssange> ugh, nope.
18:18 < JulianAssange> o0h wow
18:18 < JulianAssange> you're right heinrich5991 
18:18 < JulianAssange> i made it 11. not -11
18:18 < JulianAssange> tyvm
18:44 < JulianAssange> 1
18:45 < EastBite> heinrich5991: good thing you are working on that
18:49 < heinrich5991_> EastBite: why? :)
18:50 < heinrich5991_> EastBite: my old connection is stale, haven't seen your answer, sorry
18:50 < JulianAssange> yeah
18:50 < JulianAssange> good thing
18:50 < JulianAssange> so EastBite doesn't have to do it :>
18:50 < heinrich5991_> =)
18:50 < heinrich5991_> well afk
18:50 < EastBite> yes, that's why
19:14 < JulianAssange> deen: where are automated demos stored?
19:14 < JulianAssange> i beat a map and i want to view the demo
19:17 <@minus> someone tell me how to restart pulseaudio
19:17 < EastBite> JulianAssange: iirc demos aren't saved if you don't finish the map
19:17 < JulianAssange> pulseaudio -k
19:17 <@minus> it being a zombie (with gconf-helper as a subprocess, also a zombie) owned by PID 1
19:17 <@minus> except rebooting
19:18 < EastBite> I removed this kind of race demos from ddnet
19:18 < JulianAssange> EastBite: i did beat it
19:18 <@minus> like, who the fuck invented zombies not being killable
19:18 < EastBite> no idea then
19:18 < JulianAssange> i dont think it saved it -.-
19:18 < JulianAssange> i had 3 clients solo Skillz 5
19:56 < deen> JulianAssange: hm, i heard before of autorecording not working properly in ddnet and ddrace client. i should probably take a look soon
19:58 < JulianAssange> well
19:58 < JulianAssange> i did that 3 clients solo skillz 5 a few days ago
19:58 < JulianAssange> but like 30 mins ago i re-finished it (uynder a different name) and exited normally ('exit' in f1), and it didn't save
20:00 < JulianAssange> which sucks because that 3 client solo was epic
20:00 < JulianAssange> it took 56 minutes or something
20:00 < JulianAssange> and good alt tab skills on my part lol
20:01 < deen> might have to do with running multiple clients
20:01 < deen> at the same time
20:01 < deen> i think aaa said that sth like that happened to him once too
20:03 < JulianAssange> well
20:04 < JulianAssange> this one wasn't a solo
20:04 < JulianAssange> the one a few minutes ago
20:19 < JulianAssange> Learath2: follow me
20:19 < JulianAssange> on tw
20:20 < Learath2> JulianAssange: busy
20:54 <@minus> man, catalyst a shit, no Xorg 1.15 support
20:55 < Learath2> minus: y not use the open src drivers ?
20:57 < progers> minus: Thats why i bought Nvidia 760
21:00 < BotoX> >catalyst
21:00 < BotoX> lel
21:02 <@minus> because my dock's not working
21:02 < JulianAssange> [14-03-28 07:01:56][assert]: src/base/system.c(178): mem_alloc failure
21:02 < JulianAssange> Segmentation fault (core dumped)
21:02 < JulianAssange> LOL
21:02 < JulianAssange> lol
21:02 <@minus> did you run out of RAM?
21:02 < JulianAssange> i doubt it
21:02 < JulianAssange> it's not vanilla tw
21:03 < JulianAssange> it's deen's messed up client
21:05 < JulianAssange> actualy ir probably did minus 
21:05 < JulianAssange> memory leak
21:10 < deen> JulianAssange: never heard of that
23:20 < heinrich5991> minus: have you done your part already? :)
23:45 < heinrich5991> minus: you here? :)
