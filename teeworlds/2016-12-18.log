14:09 < ParanoiaSystem> hello
14:10 <@minus> o/
14:10 < ParanoiaSystem> I have an issue with a last game build for OSX
14:12 < ParanoiaSystem> I have try to run the game in the terminal
14:12 < ParanoiaSystem> this is the error
14:12 < ParanoiaSystem> https://thepasteb.in/p/mwh1Bk7yR6wh5
14:13 < ParanoiaSystem> dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/SDL.framework/Versions/A/SDL
14:14 <@minus> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
14:15 <@minus> would be nice to have some dev that can deal with OSX
14:46 <+necropotame> would be nice to have some dev :D
14:47 <@minus> :D
15:01 < nameless_tee06> hello
15:02 < nameless_tee06> is anyone here
15:02 < nameless_tee06> Hellooo
15:02 < quatria> hellloo
15:02 < nameless_tee06> anyone here know about server config?
15:02 < quatria> what do you want to do?
15:02 < nameless_tee06> I am hosting a block server
15:03 < nameless_tee06> and I want /register and /login
15:03 < nameless_tee06> For vip rooms
15:03 < quatria> oh idk how this works sry, maybe someone else
15:03 < nameless_tee06> Ohh its ok bro 
15:06 <@minus> that's not a teeworlds feature but some mod's. the docs of the mod should have info on that
15:12 <+necropotame> nameless_tee06, , you should ask at #ddnet
19:43 < Fin> nameless-tee06: you can find this feature in XXLDDRace mod Code
21:52 <+necropotame> heinrich5991, on the website, when you click on "Install Teeworlds 0.6.4 on Ubuntu", you obtain the version Version 0.6.2+dfsg. I know that repositories are not fast to get updated, but in this case, I think it's better to provide directly the binaries in a tar.gz
23:02 <+rand> with the risk of wrong dependencies ? (sdl/libc/…) (or wrong abi)
23:04 <+necropotame> The point is that you click to get specifically 0.6.4 and you obtain something else instead
23:05 <+necropotame> I think it's better to provide the generic version instead of a wrong version. In particular if you are looking for a more secure version
