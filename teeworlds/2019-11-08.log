12:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Im not sure if i messed something up during compilation but running tw with valgrind drops some errors :/

12:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Or is my driver broken?
12:30 <@Dune_> sounds like there's a bug somewhere
12:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but on tw side or on my side?
12:30 <@Dune_> vanilla?
12:30 <@Dune_> build vanilla teeworlds with debugging symbols and run valgrind again
12:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
12:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> master
12:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> master build with cmake debug
12:31 <@Dune_> huh wait that's OpenGL's fault
12:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea or my driver idk
12:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe you could check if it works for you
12:31 <@Dune_> yeah when I get a linux access
12:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cool
12:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> r u using irc on windows? o.O
12:33 <@Dune_> yes? irc is just a protocol :p
12:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea ikr
12:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what client are you using on windows?
12:34 <@Dune_> usually hexchat to connect to my bouncer
12:34 <@Dune_> but since my bouncer is RIP I use miranda
12:35 <@Dune_> I think miranda still tries to connect to MSN and ICQ :D
12:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ah true i remember downloading hexchat on win too at some point
12:35 <@Dune_> it's not very stable unfortunately
12:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm
12:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> So since valgrind does not help me i am really lost on debugging my client :/ It crashes on exit.
12:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
12:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/642326541308788789/unknown.png
12:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> any idea?
12:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> No such file or directory really does not make sense to me.
12:37 <@Dune_> just valgrind looking for stuff
12:37 <@Dune_> it seems to crash on a mem_zero
12:37 <@Dune_> so doublefree I imagine
12:37 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> How can i tell valgrind to look for that?
12:37 <@Dune_> lok for what?
12:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> didnt you just recommend to ook for a mem_zero with valgrind specifically? Or did i missunderstood u?
12:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> huh no
12:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> irc just crashed welp
12:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> > it's not very stable unfortunately
12:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd
14:15 < ym> Hi. Could somebody tell, where is repository of zCatch mod located?
14:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ym: as far as i know the latest and greatest shit is this one: https://github.com/jxsl13/zcatch
14:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But zcatch is pretty old and forked so im not sure if there is even "THE zCatch mod"
14:58 < ym> Got it, thanks, bridge_.
15:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> My name is bridge now xd
15:08 < ym> s/bridge_/ChillerDragon/
15:08 < ym> sorry
15:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> haha np ðŸ™‚
15:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> "as far as i know the latest and greatest shit is this one" it's buggy as crap :'(.
15:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> It might be buggy but i dont think there is any more advanced zcatch mod for 0.7
16:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @ChillerDragon @Dune you can use the web-irc on https://webchat.quakenet.org/
16:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> no application required
16:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> ? I know ^^
16:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I use kiwiirc instead ;)
16:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune does the background theme change? Or does it just switch between day and night?
16:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> What do you mean? You can change it in the options
16:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> f1 options or is there an ui for that
16:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> You can add custom themes ( they are just .map s)
16:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> There is an Ui
16:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Settings General Themes
16:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> Ah, under "general" and not under "graphics", makes sense
16:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> I will do a PR with a new _special_ theme ðŸ˜‰
16:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Themes must meet a certain amount of requirements to be fit though, such as not being too eye disturbing, since they are merely a background ;)
16:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> If you want one to be in the official, talk to our map expert sonix
16:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> you don't know yet what i have in mind ðŸ˜‰ where can i find your export?
16:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> *expert
16:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Sonix meep
17:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> webirc has no history :/
19:11 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> Btw Dune, have you seen The Lounge https://thelounge.chat/ ? That's the client I use, and I'm also a developer of it.
20:34 < Dune_> > Remain connected to IRC servers while you are offline. Forget about bouncers. Resume where you left off on any device.
20:34 < Dune_> huh, so it's a bouncer somehow, richrd?
20:37 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> Dune, it's like KiwiIRC so you run it on your server and it's always connected. Basically The Lounge is a KiwiIRC competitor.
20:42 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> It's based on the same irc-framework as kiwiirc
22:10 < bridge_> [freenode] <fstd> but is it 'hand-crafted' like kiwiirc?
22:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> made with â™¥ in sf
22:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> or something
