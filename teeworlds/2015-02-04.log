10:02 < JulianAssange> what does teeworlds use for ip encryption?
10:02 < JulianAssange> xor?
10:04 <@matricks> erh.. nothing?
10:04 <@matricks> thing that I know off
10:04 <@matricks> *of
10:06 < JulianAssange> i thought it used encryption at some stages 
10:06 <@matricks> no
10:06 <@matricks> there is no encryption what so ever
10:07 < JulianAssange> mm.. oh well. btw, what is scripts/nicks.txt?
10:07 <@matricks> JulianAssange: used for testing the master server
10:07 <@matricks> JulianAssange: extracted loads of player names from it to use for fake servers
10:07 < JulianAssange> ah ok
12:06 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: there's only huffman encryption
12:06 < heinrich5991> fuck
12:06 < heinrich5991> huffman compression
12:06 <@matricks> huffman encryption :D
12:06 <@matricks> best kind of encryption
12:07 < heinrich5991> :)
12:12 <@minus> well, huffman without the LUT isn't too bad
12:12 <@minus> still better than rot13!
12:24 < heinrich5991> minus: what does the LUT table have to do with it?
12:24 < heinrich5991> -table
12:32 <@minus> if you don't have the mapping from huffman codewords to bytes it's a bit hard to figure out what it says
12:34 < heinrich5991> well yea
12:35 <@matricks> minus: no it isn't
12:35 <@matricks> minus: you can quite easily figure that one out
12:36 <@matricks> minus: you can do some analysis because you know kinda what it should be, and with enough data you can use some statistics to figure the whole thing out
12:38 <@matricks> should be fairly simple to reconstruct the huffman tree
12:39 <@minus> if you know what the data should look like, yeah
12:39 <@minus> i didn't say it was safe
12:43 <@matricks> kinda should look like which you know with teeworlds :)
13:08 < JulianAssange> I'm making a xor_encrypt and a xor_decrypt function
13:08 < JulianAssange> it is making me mad :(
13:08 <@matricks> JulianAssange: why?
13:09 < JulianAssange> because i suck at it
13:09 < JulianAssange> but i'm nerly there
13:10 < JulianAssange> i ned to hardcore some encrypted strings into the program, but I can't printf the encrypted strings
13:10 < JulianAssange> (obviously)
13:10 < JulianAssange> so now i'm printing them as decimals and using that
13:10 <@matricks> what pseudo security are you doing? :D
13:12 < JulianAssange> none
13:12 < JulianAssange> i just don't want the strings to show up when running `strings' on them :>
13:12 <@matricks> pseudo security :D
13:12 < JulianAssange> of course
13:12 <@matricks> it's like a ticking timebomb
13:18 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: make a compiler plugin :)
13:21 < JulianAssange> lolno
13:22 < JulianAssange> i have it all good now, nearly
13:34 < JulianAssange> oh em gee, i got it finally
13:35 < JulianAssange> i printf("%i");'d eacharray piece(name escapes me atm)
13:35 < JulianAssange> and then manually put it into char string[] = {....};
13:59 <@minus> you could encrypt the segment with the string constants after building and when loading the program decode them
13:59 <@minus> then you can obviously just make a memory dump though
14:00 < JulianAssange> yes memory dumps are fine, it's not real security
14:00 < JulianAssange> i just don't want strings to come up w/ the info
14:00 < JulianAssange> anyone ould just look at the asm of of it too, and see what it does
14:10 < JulianAssange> http://pastebin.com/fHvVTBPx that was the end result
14:10 < JulianAssange> and now it is time to sleep
14:11 < Muttley> anyone here has knowledge of the infection server ?
14:11 < Muttley> i found a git repo but it might be an outdated source https://github.com/Teetime/teeworlds/tree/infection
14:26 < Teetime> Muttley: this is a clone of infection from 0.6 which i made because i played it quite often then and it seems the original source has been lost
14:26 < Muttley> Teetime, 
14:26 < Muttley> if have compiled it with bam but i cant seem to connect
14:28 < Teetime> it's based on teeworlds 0.6 so actually you should be able to connect.. sure you used the right branch?
14:28 < Muttley> is this a know error with this source ?
14:28 < Muttley> the master branch
14:29 < Muttley> Teetime, it is starting normaly but when i connect nothing happens i do see a disconnect once i close the connection
14:29 < Teetime> the master-branch is an (unmodified) teeworlds 0.7 so of course you cannot connect with the 0.6 client
14:30 < Teetime> download the infection-branch/-zip and try again
14:30 < Muttley> hmm that figures, ok will try
14:31 < Muttley> Teetime, this one ? https://github.com/Teetime/teeworlds/releases/tag/0.6.0-release
14:31 < Teetime> no
14:31 < Teetime> https://github.com/Teetime/teeworlds/archive/infection.zip
14:34 < Muttley> Teetime, ty, this one has a error building though
14:34 < jxsl13> you gonna update infection to 0.6.3, Teetime ?
14:36 < Muttley> http://tny.cz/ea2f68b2
14:36 < Teetime> yea, I could do it in the next few days
14:37 < jxsl13> thx man :D
14:37 < jxsl13> want to add it so my server hosting environment and well, I woulnt want people to exploit that mod :)
14:38 < Muttley> 0.6 exploitable ?
14:38 < Muttley> jxsl13, 
14:38 < jxsl13> sadly there are so many interesting mods which the creators didnt touch for 4 years :/
14:38 < jxsl13> Muttley teeworlds.com 
14:39 < Muttley> ah
14:39 < jxsl13> like catching ._.
14:45 < Muttley> is it easy to rewrite it to 6.3?
14:49 < jxsl13> I think it is most likely only those security fixec, cuz the mods are already for 0.6.0 or 0.6.1
14:49 < jxsl13> fixes*
14:50 < Muttley> ok, so it should take up to much time ;-)
14:50 < Muttley> to bad there is not an active development going for the infection mod
14:51 < jxsl13> teetime said he'd update it in the next few days :O
14:51 < Muttley> yea i know, but is would be great if there where a few developers active on it ;-)
14:52 < jxsl13> I think the mod iteself is already finished 
14:53 < Muttley> ok
14:54 < Teetime> Muttley: I will upload a fixed version on github the next days, this is a fixed version for src/game/server/entities/wall.cpp http://pastebin.com/imxepGSf
14:55 < Muttley> src/game/server/entities/wall.cpp:9:18: fatal error: wall.h: No such file or directory
14:55 < Muttley> ty
14:55 < Muttley> almost
14:56 < Teetime> jxsl13: my version of infection is not really finished, i actually never really tested it... it's just a clone i once made because i was bored
14:57 < jxsl13> oh :/
14:57 < Teetime> are you sure you're at the infection-directory? there must be a wall.h inside
14:58 < Muttley> crap
14:59 < Muttley> bam: done
14:59 < Muttley> cool ty
15:00 < Muttley> is is there an easy way to increase the max allowed players ?
15:00 <@matricks> no
15:00 < Muttley> 2 bad
15:07 <@minus> badly implemented max palyer limit, right matricks?
15:07 < BotoX> damn
15:07 < BotoX> insurgency
15:07 < BotoX> is so nice
15:07 <@minus> no.
15:07 <@minus> i'ma go home now.
15:08 <@matricks> minus: what do you mean badly?
15:08 < Muttley> i see one server that modded the max players so it is done ;-)
15:08 < BotoX> afaik it only sends the closest 16 players to you
15:08 <@minus> matricks: not just a one-constant-change required to alter the lmit
15:08 < jxsl13_> true
15:09 < BotoX> if you want "real" more than 16 players support you have to play with a modded client
15:09 < jxsl13_> ddnet uses it
15:09 <@minus> matricks: do you even know how to program games?
15:09 <@matricks> minus: well, it is, up to a certain degree
15:09 <@matricks> minus: problem is more far streached then just adding more players
15:10 <@minus> network packet sizes?
15:10 <@matricks> minus: no, that is handled
15:10 <@minus> what'd be a problem for example?
15:10 <@matricks> minus: but there is a couple of locations that uses an 32bit ints as masks for clients
15:10 <@matricks> minus: and the gameplay doesn't handle more players, even 16 is a bit of a streach
15:11 <@minus> why is 16 a stretch already?
15:11 <@matricks> gets too messy
15:11 <@minus> oh, gameplay
15:11 <@minus> yes
15:11 <@minus> 128 players on ctf5, go
15:11 <@minus> no, but seriously
15:12 <@minus> i'ma go home now
15:12 <@minus> o/
15:12 <@matricks> cheers
15:13 < jxsl13_> the more the merrier
15:13 <@matricks> no
15:13 < jxsl13_> :D in certain mods at least
15:14 <@matricks> mods isn't teeworlds...
15:14 < jxsl13_> thats true
15:16 < Muttley> for the infection 32 to 64 is ok
15:17 <@matricks> when making teeworlds, you can't take all mods into account
15:17 <@matricks> you do teeworlds and what the mods do thats up to them
15:18 <@matricks> also... visual c++ freakin' sucks
15:22 <@matricks> that freaking editor/debugger makes me work in slow motion
15:23 < Muttley> i believe u ;-)
22:32 < Muttballs> anyone up for a testrun on my new map ?
