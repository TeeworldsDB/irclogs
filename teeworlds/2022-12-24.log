01:36 < minus> requiring new forum accounts to be requested through a irc/matrix/discord bot might be a good idea
01:36 < minus> 99% of registrations are spam
01:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> minus: how would that work?
01:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> just manually?
01:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> nevermind, I didn't read "bot". will get more sleep
01:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> can't be arsed to figure how to connect a chat bot to punBB, but a good intermediary solution would be manual confirmation. there is one real account every two moons
11:02 < minus> well i didn't think that far
11:43 < minus> i've been seeing a *lot* of mail delivery notifications from one provider in the last 2 days, meaning spam registrations are way up
11:44 < minus> i guess the simplest solution would be to disable registrations and let anyone who really wants an account ask on irc/matrix/discord
12:13 < ChillerDragon> are those automated isnt there a captcha?
12:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there's a captcha
12:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you can get a captcha solve for <0.01$
12:32 < ChillerDragon> interesting. By like people who manually click it for money or how?
12:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> by people in poor countries, yes
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah, apparently around 0.001$
13:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> Nice where can I sign up! I need those coins
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Damn, poor people really are cheap
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think we should go forward with disabling account registration
14:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Juan Ramón Maqueda.> Grupo en español?
15:07 < ChillerDragon> oui oui espanol baguette
15:07 < ChillerDragon> oh wait..
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no, this is an english chat
