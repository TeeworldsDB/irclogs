15:06 <@minus> nice job on the web version of teeworlds; maybe you can write a proxy server so that you can use it with other teeworlds server as well (i'm assuming the servers just run HTTP/Websocket on 8303 in addition of UDP)
15:06 <@matricks> huh? wat?
15:06 < Learath2> teewebs.net
15:06 <@minus> @ eeeee
15:06 <@minus> matricks: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11347
15:08 <@matricks> cancer
15:08 < Sonix-> lol
15:09 < Learath2> that reaction tho
15:11  * matricks gets sad
15:21 <@minus> Sonix-: i tried applying the CSS on the site, it looked weird. lots of spacing in the tables
15:28 <@minus> matricks: that would not have happened had you continued developing teeworlds
15:28 <@minus> you're the only one to blame it came that far
15:29 <@matricks> heh
15:35 < Sonix-> minus: that's not a problem we can adjust that anytime, I've just tried to give some nicer look and make the formatting less messy :P
15:38 <@minus> the whole site is a mess!
15:38 <@matricks> which site?
15:38 <@minus> tw.com
15:38 <@minus> your code!
15:38 <@matricks> hehehheheheeh
15:38 < Sonix-> :D
15:39 < Sonix-> so minus whats up with the forum thing
15:39 < Sonix-> what u gonna do
15:39 <@minus> need to migrate stuffs if we do it
15:39 <@minus> plus i have no time
15:40 < Sonix-> so we'll migrate to discourse?
15:42 < Sonix-> well thats gonna be alot of work
22:33 < eeeee> h8ers gonna h8
22:35 < eeeee> minus: i have such a proxy, however if i make it public it'd get abused by trolls and get ip-banned on every server. there are also restrictions on max clients per ip and stuff...
22:48  * matricks gives eeeee the stink eye
22:51  * eeeee feels not worthy of the gift of a stink eye and hands it back
22:52 < eeeee> i spent so much time on that, you have to at least pretend to like it!
22:53 <@matricks> hitler spent a lot of time exterminating the jews as well
22:53 <@matricks> Godwin in 1 minute
22:54 < eeeee> if you were questioned by hitler you'd totally pretend you liked that
22:55 <@matricks> eeeee: too bad I'm the hilter of this channel
22:55 <@matricks> eeeee: and you will dislike your work!
22:55 <@matricks> :D
22:56 < eeeee> well, shit
22:56 <@matricks> naa, it's kinda cool that it can be done, but it's kinda shit
22:56 < eeeee> it's not gonna exterminate jews or anything
22:58 <@matricks> just that bringing it over to a platform that isn't suited for it at all
22:58 <@matricks> it's like doing teeworlds for mobile phones
22:58 < eeeee> ^ was done before me
22:58 <@matricks> I know
22:59 <@matricks> but action games over tcp... 
22:59 <@matricks> yuck, like spitting on the fine tuned network code that I built
23:00 < eeeee> well it's expected that if someone likes the game he would download the desktop version to continue playing
23:00 <@matricks> but you present with with a worse experience then the real thing
23:01 < eeeee> but it's more accessible
23:03 < eeeee> and i believe the networking part can be improved to behave close to desktop version
23:04 <@matricks> several sockets etc
23:04 < eeeee> still i could include a huge notice that desktop version has less lags and better experience and shit and you should really download it etc.., if that'd make you happy
23:04 <@matricks> not really
23:04 <@matricks> I'll be happy the day javascript dies the death it deserves
23:05 < eeeee> not happening anytime soon, sorry
23:05 <@matricks> I know
23:05 <@matricks> almost noone cares anymore
23:06 <@matricks> it's an dying art
23:06 < eeeee> what is?
23:06 <@matricks> coding for performance
23:07 < eeeee> well to be fair, biggest perf problems in the current code are not language specific
23:08 <@matricks> javascript + game programming == get the fuck out
23:08 <@matricks> only reason why it works is because the hardware is soo fast to compensate for the shortcommings of javascript
23:09 < eeeee> shortcomings like what
23:09 <@matricks> GC
23:09 < eeeee> no GC in asm.js
23:10 <@matricks> javascript == GC
23:11 < eeeee> but it allocates a huge array for the heap and then suballocates that, so nothing new gets allocated during the run
23:12 < eeeee> GC would still run ofc, but it would have nothing to do so shouldn't stall anything
23:13 <@matricks> heh, this is why I hate javascript
23:14 <@matricks> everyone is just trying to work around it because it's a peice of shit
23:14 <@matricks> sorry, I don't have much nice things to say about webstuff and javascript
23:14 < eeeee> wouldn't argue with that, js is a shitty language
23:15 < eeeee> however that's what we currently have on the web and it's not gonna change no matter how much you hate it
23:15 <@matricks> so.. you empower it to continue
23:15 < LittleWhite> +1 with matricks opinion on JS
23:15 < eeeee> i just put the fuken teeworlds and the fuken web
23:15 < eeeee> s/and/on
23:16 < eeeee> i'm not helping js to take over the world
23:16 <@matricks> eeeee: you help it by using it, if noone was using it, it would go away
23:17 <@matricks> using something is supporting it
23:17 <@matricks> I remember the days were I could surf the web with javascript of
23:17 < eeeee> well why don't you start preaching people that they should stop running any javascript in their browsers
23:17 <@matricks> I did, I lost that battle
23:18 <@matricks> now you can't browse the web without it
23:18 < eeeee> isn't it time to admit the defeat and move on, then?
23:19 <@matricks> eeeee: why?
23:20 <@matricks> I kinda know that in the end we will end with javascript interfaces to the kernel, yes, I know this, but that doesnt mean I think it's a good idea
23:26 <@matricks> the web and cube as soo much in common
23:27 < LittleWhite> cube ?
23:27 <@matricks> the movie
23:28 < LittleWhite> Well, I still can't see the point, but this is certainly because I don't remember enough the movie
23:28 <@matricks> the web is built like a headless blunder
23:28 <@matricks> no one in charge, no direction
23:29 <@matricks> were a language designed in one week is the dominating forc
23:29 <@matricks> force
23:31 < LittleWhite> And only the innocent will survive ? :D
23:32 < eeeee> once chrome and ff agree and add something better than js, i'd totally port all my stuff to it right away
23:32 < eeeee> until then...
23:32 <@matricks> eeeee: there is
23:32 < eeeee> what is it
23:32 <@matricks> eeeee: it has existed for over 30 years
23:33 <@matricks> it's called X11
23:33 <@matricks> that's almost what the web is today
23:33 <@matricks> took them long enough to get back around but yeah
23:34 < eeeee> not a lot of people use it
23:34 <@matricks> I know
23:35 <@matricks> and thats what I said, nobody cares anymore about performance almost
23:36 < eeeee> i just want to make my stuff usable by actual people, not to fight an uphill battle against the shitty technologies
23:36 <@matricks> I know, and thats why shitty tech is winning
23:36 <@matricks> accessability above all else
23:37 <@matricks> damn the costs
23:40 <@matricks> people today are so driven by exposure
23:40 <@matricks> way back in tw days I stayed away from it
23:40 <@matricks> they were not allowed to publish the game in magazines, do interviews etc
23:41 <@matricks> now it's, I want X because Y more people would play it
23:44 < eeeee> sounds way too hypocritical, you're probably reaping some benefits of many such tradeoffs made in the past
23:44 <@matricks> what benefits?
23:45 <@matricks> the benefit is that I made a game the way I wanted, not the way someone else wanted, not just adding stuff because people wanted it
23:45 <@matricks> it's a destilled experience, cleaned out of anything that didn't really belong
23:46 < LittleWhite> But matricks, you know , accessiblity, comfort, is always above all, even liberty/privacy :)
23:46 <@matricks> LittleWhite: well, not to me :)
23:47 <@matricks> LittleWhite: even tho I started to become more and more of an outcast for not subscribing to companies
23:47 < LittleWhite> but you have to reduce "comfort" or "easyness"
