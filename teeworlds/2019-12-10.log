08:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> redix, I wouldn't worry about that. As long as it's fixed in 0.7.4
08:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Sonix posted some icon sketch
12:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> i guess i need some help with this one:
12:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/AssassinTee/teeworlds/commit/4b70a577eae3624f5b319942c38afcc501d6c669/checks?check_suite_id=350997873
12:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> mac says sdl2 is not installed when it clearly is, i remember why i don't compile mac with cmake
12:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> windows on the other hand with bam: `Unknown Architecture 'unknown'. Supported: x86, x86_64` wtf?
13:41 < redix> Assa: use the latest bam version (master, not 0.5.1). Should fix the windows issue
14:24 < Learath2> huh, macOS is indeed a mess, but with cmake it does compile for me
15:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> +1 what redix says
15:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Assa i have no clue about github actions and i find them very confuing but for circleci there is the issue that when you just do ``brew install sdl2`` it will fail if there is no ``brew update`` before that
15:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @redix thank you I will try
15:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @ChillerDragon sdl2 installation works, because bam is working but not cmake?!
15:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> -DPREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON ?
15:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> idk just worth a try
15:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> windows is now spitting out a list of other errors
15:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/AssassinTee/teeworlds/commit/e5046c4a2d2bd2d2da6b1dfbad8d8032f4c7abb8/checks?check_suite_id=351327871
16:01 < redix> The header which are generated by the python script seem to be empty =\
16:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes, the protocol stuff is missing üòÆ
16:03 < redix> Bundled libs won't work for MacOS since vanilla only ships windows libs
16:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> is there a difference between bam everything and bam all?
16:07 < redix> Does bam everything even work?
16:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> no i am just confused with cmake, it's `bam all` and `make everything`
16:12 < redix> Maybe skip bam on windows for now and only try with cmake
16:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> i have already done cmake on windows and it's working
16:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> but @Dune said I should do it with bam, too
16:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> same for mac: bam is working there, but cmake is hard for some reason
16:13 < redix> The appveyor windows build does not use bam either
16:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> What errors @ùìîùìºùìºùì≤ùì∞ùì™ùìæùìΩùì∏ùì∂ùì™ùìΩ ?
16:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> redix: yeah and this is bad, we missed a bug for a long time
16:14 < redix> Dune: timer icon from sonix is fine :)
16:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune the last 3:
16:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/AssassinTee/teeworlds/actions
16:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Nice
16:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> 404
16:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> hmm
16:15 < redix> Well... There have always been issues with calling python from bam on windows
16:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> CC or screenshit
16:16 < redix> Maybe it's Powershell related? Never tried using bam in it
16:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> github actions probably uses the powershell on the run command
16:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Try bam content all
16:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think you are lacking content Assa
16:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't have a computer so I can't check
16:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Does bam client work?
16:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> I will check
16:20 < redix> Btw... What about updating the sdl windows libs to 2.0.10? Clang spits out lots of warnings for 2.0.8 :O
16:20 < redix> bam all should include content I think
16:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> 2.0.9 was troublesome
16:21 < redix> According to the log the python scripts were called without errors but the output is probably not piped to the files
16:25 < redix> clang should be added to the CI stuff as well :D
16:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> content all didn't work, too
17:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> redix: so you think the errors are hidden or the output of python is just not used?
17:51 < redix> I guess the output is not used... But I'm not sure
18:06 < bridge_> [freenode] <JewZeus> 3 days in and I can kind of tarzan my way around the maps but I'm still not aiming properly and I keep reverting to qwerty FPS reflexes, lol
18:13 < Dune> If it's a controls issue you can adjust that :)
18:39 < bridge_> [freenode] <JewZeus> no no the controls are fine, I just have built-in reflexes I'm struggling to overcome
18:39 < bridge_> [freenode] <JewZeus> jesus christ some of y'all are fast in this game tho
18:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> some of them play this game for more than 10 years :o
18:41 < bridge_> [freenode] <JewZeus> yeah it shows, lol
19:36 < redix> When I call the python script in the gh actions environment I have to create the output folder before. Then it works.
19:36 < redix> Bam still fails... The files are created but empty
20:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ehm, is it possible to fix the auto completion of nicknames while whispering, currently tab switches the target of your whispering message.
20:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @jxsl13 everything possible, but unbelievable much work üòÆ
20:16 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @heinrich5991 stop talking to yourself?
20:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd
20:36 < Oy> Dune: we should postpone that feature deadline till friday. have some time on friday and would like to test the race stuff then :)
21:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> deadline: 24.12.2019 23:59
21:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe race could make use of customly renderer entities/text
22:44 < Dune> I like the friday idea
