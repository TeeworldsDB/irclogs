22:20 <@minus> did you kill all of your websites, Kottizen?
22:35 < Kottizen> minus: Not on purpose. :(
22:35 < Kottizen> They're up to me? :o
22:36 <@minus> kottnet is just a logo, teeplace is gone
22:36 < Kottizen> Aaah you mean like that. Yes, I did indeed remove some of the ones that weren't used. :/
22:36 < Kottizen> Focusing on www.kottcraft.se nowadays (Minecraft).
22:37 <@minus> oh nice
22:37 < Kottizen> Have you played Minecraft?
22:37 <@minus> a bit back in the day
22:37 < Kottizen> It's entirely in Swedish, but if you're familiar with Towny you might recognize the concept.
22:38 <@minus> but i know someone else running a big minecraft server
22:38 <@minus> i'm not
22:38 < Kottizen> Kottcraft is all about building cities -- https://kottcraft.kottnet.net/map/#map_kottcraft/0/25/-9573/2170/64
22:38 < Kottizen> Which server?
22:39 <@minus> kohi i think it was called
22:39 < Kottizen> The idea was never to make it big. :/ I was just lucky enough to grab the domain svenskminecraftserver.se (literally "Swedish Minecraft server"), making the website rank well on Google.
22:39 < Kottizen> Looks neat :o
22:41 < Kottizen> 51 643 rounds of survival games!
