15:53 < luca> Hey, is it possible to compile the TW src in Linux for a Windows OS?
15:56 < luca> Well I mean without a VS
16:11 <@heinrich5991> luca: you can use mingw I think
16:11 <@heinrich5991> mingw for linux
16:16 < luca> Is there a tuto or something, how to?
16:22 <@minus> i don't even know if that works
16:23 <@minus> you'd basically have to set family to windows and compiler to gcc, then alter a couple compiler executable paths, i uess
16:25 < luca> Mhmm okay...so did someone did it before?
16:26 < luca> Someone in #DDNet said, the actual ddnet is compiled with mingw
16:43 <@heinrich5991> yes
17:26 < luca> Someone knows how to do it manually?
17:28 < Henningstone> I've got a CI-setup for this, maybe to give you an idea of what you'd need... Want to have a look?
17:30 < Henningstone> I hope it's not too confusing, you need to ignore a lot of (for you) useless stuff: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx/master/circle.yml
20:27 < Neox> hello! I made a mod for teeworlds, I'll publish it in the forum. It will be open source, and before publishing it I'd like to put it in github. I never had an active project on github. I know how to fork (I forked the teeworlds mod my mod is based on), but idk how to apply the changes
20:27 < Neox> So, is there a nice person to help me about this please? :)
20:30 <@minus> the internet is a nice person
20:31 < Neox> But I searched already :(
20:31 < Neox> I'm posting here if I really can't find! I know that I can upload a file to my repo, but do I really need to upload all the files in the correct directory? Can't I just put the folder and let git do all the stuff?
20:39 <@minus> you clone the repo with git, then chang your stuff, then commit it and push it to github
20:39 <@minus> that doesn't go through the website
20:40 < Neox> I clone it... you mean I fork it right? I did change my stuff, and I think to push it.. it's git add <foldername>.. no?
20:41 <@minus> no, i mean clone to your pc
20:41 <@minus> yeah, git add
20:41 < Neox> uhm.. well, I downloaded it, is it the same? or wait I'll look at it myself, thanks for these infos at least :)
20:42 <@minus> if you downloaded the zip from github it's NOT the same
20:42 < Neox> Alright :)
20:42 <@minus> you need to clone it with git (or even github's git client)
20:42 <@minus> but if you already have git installed it's a simple 'git clone <url>'
20:48 < Neox> Oh ok, thank you minus!
20:53 <@heinrich5991> Neox: ping me if you need any help
20:54 < Neox> Alright, thank you heinrich! :)
21:00 < Neox> heinrich5991: So I did what minus told me, I replaced the sources there, then I wrote git add teeworlds (when I cloned it, it called it "teeworlds" so yeah..). I think I'm not connected in git from the.. uhm... command line?
21:00 < Neox> Anyway, it told me : fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
21:01 <@heinrich5991> ipv6 ^ :o
21:01 <@heinrich5991> Neox: you first need to cd into teeworlds
21:01 < Neox> Alright then
21:05 < Neox> I think it worked? I'm not sure. I got this warning for all my files : The file will have its original line endings in your working directory. I checked the repo, but it's not updated?
21:05 < Neox> Anyway I'll note what I'm doing somewhere, so that I won't bother anyone else later with these things...
21:05 <@heinrich5991> mh. I could tell you all the commands to try, or we could try to find a good git tutorial
21:06 <@heinrich5991> I'd guess the latter one would be more useful
21:06 < Neox> Do as you wish! :)
21:07 < Neox> But I wanted to say, I'm not connected to github with this cmd thing? I mean, how can it even know where to put it?
21:10 <@heinrich5991> Neox: the git repo is something local as well
21:11 < Neox> hmm.. I'm used to use svn (learned from school), i know that git is the same. But I didn't know that it could be local too
21:11 <@heinrich5991> ah yea
21:11 <@heinrich5991> git is a lot more local
21:11 <@heinrich5991> unless you say something like "git push", everything is local only
21:11 < Neox> Alright, I guess I'll try git push then :)
21:12 <@heinrich5991> have you done a commit already?
21:12 < Neox> No?
21:12 <@heinrich5991> so, to commit your stuff, you need to "git add" it
21:12 <@heinrich5991> then git commit -m "<message>"
21:12 <@heinrich5991> and then "git push"
21:12 < Neox> Thank you!! I'll try it now :)
21:13 <@heinrich5991> Neox: do you know svn fairly well?
21:14 < Neox> Not soo well, I used it just by right clicking, hitting commit etc... no cmds with it
21:14 <@heinrich5991> ah
21:14 < Neox> I used it only last year, not so so much
21:16 <@heinrich5991> if you like reading, you could try this: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control
21:16 < Neox> Thank you! :) I think I will read it. I need it.
21:17 <@minus> git is gud to know
21:18 < Neox> Yeah I know. This is why I'm hardly trying to get into it now! :)
21:18 < Neox> remote: Permission to east/teeworlds.git denied to Neox76.
21:18 < Neox> this is what I'm getting
21:19 < Neox> (it's based on east's anti spoof mod)
21:20 < Neox> wait I think I have to clone my own repo?
21:21 <@minus> you don't necessarily have to clone your own repo, but you have to push to it
21:21 <@minus> heinrich5991: explain
21:23 < Neox> I see, well I just deleted that folder and I'm cloning my own repo... but yeah I got it, I guess I just have to read what he sent me. I'll do it after putting this to the forum :)
21:28 <@minus> well, since heinrich5991 isn't explaining: it basically goes like this: you add your github repo to the local git as remote (git add remote my-github git@github.com:...), then explicitly push to it (git push my-github <branch>)
21:29 < Neox> hmm, I think I got it!
21:29 < Neox> Thank you minus
21:31 < Neox> Yay! I have it done :) Thanks! Have a good night!
21:32 < Neox> ow, I think it's good to edit the repo name tho, it's called teeworlds... well I'll try this by myself
21:33 < Neox> Yeah done, I'm gone! :)
