08:50 < ghost91> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/3fcbb40cac71f118a1d4684a582757d2ec93efde
08:50 < ghost91> why was that done?
08:51 < ghost91> teeworlds does not compile on 10.9 with that
08:54 < ghost91> at least it does not for me
08:58 < ghost91> nobody…?
08:58 < ghost91> :(
09:00 < heinrich5991> ghost91: have you reverted this and checked whether it works then?
09:00 < ghost91> I am doing so right now
09:01 < ghost91> but i think this is the only thing connected to my problem
09:01 < ghost91> I’m getting „SDL.h“ not found
09:01 < heinrich5991> yea, sounds a bit like a missing include directory
09:04 < ghost91> reverting it fixed my problem
09:04 < heinrich5991> shall I open an issue or will you?
09:04 < ghost91> I will
09:04 < heinrich5991> kay
09:05 < heinrich5991> ghost91: the status on the issue is that there is a fix available for about one year, just needs to get merged
09:05 < ghost91> yeah, just read it :)
09:29 < ghost91> by the way, should we ship libraries like freetype with the os x app bundle?
09:52 < ghost91> if we want to be really independent about those libs, we would need to ship libfreetype, libz, libbz2 and libpng
09:52 < ghost91> because freetype is dependent on the other ones and they are necessarily present on os x systems
09:52 <@minus> bz2?
09:53 < ghost91> ah
09:53 < ghost91> no sorry
09:53 < ghost91> only freetype and png are needed
09:53 < ghost91> bz2 and z are available
09:54 < ghost91> i got confused, because on my system freetype is linked against bz2/z versions that were installed by macports, too
09:55 <@minus> libpng should be available on the system as well, but teeworlds uses pnglite for all i know
09:55 < ghost91> yeah, but as i said, libfreetype is dependent on those libraries
09:55 < ghost91> and libpng is no present as far as i know
09:56 <@minus> ft depends on png?
09:56 < ghost91> yes
09:56 <@minus> not here
09:57 < ghost91> http://pastebin.com/mqkWJQne
09:58 <@minus> heh
09:59 <@minus> http://pastebin.com/3BQQFPqR
10:00 < ghost91> which version of freetype is that exactly?
10:01 <@minus> Name           : freetype2-infinality
10:01 <@minus> Version        : 2.4.12-2
10:01 < ghost91> I am on version 2.5.3-1
10:02 < ghost91> maybe they changed some stuff
10:43 < ghost91> so anyways, should we ship those libraries, or not?
11:08 <@minus> i think the current os x build has libs in it
11:09 <@minus> yes, shipping them is favorable to not shipping them
11:09 <@minus> ghost91: do you wanna maintain the os x builds?
11:09 < ghost91> I can do that
11:10 < ghost91> the current build was done by me
11:10 < ghost91> I’d prefer an automated way for that stuff, but I’m not sure yet on how to do that
11:10 <@minus> do you have xmpp?
11:11 <@minus> buildbot? :D
11:11 < ghost91> yeah, but it’s quite complicated to do that bundle thingie
11:12 < ghost91> I am not sure how to autmate that process
11:12 <@minus> there's a python script in the repo that does some of it
11:12 < ghost91> yeah, i know
11:12 < ghost91> I’m working with that
11:12 <@minus> :)
11:13 <@minus> and then there's also this https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1072
11:13 < ghost91> the problem is, it’s difficult to find out what libraries are needed and which of those we can assume to be present on every system
11:13 < ghost91> and do that autmatically
11:14 < ghost91> I can easily make it work on my system with the current libs that are used
11:14 < ghost91> but what happens if freetype someday decide they will use another lib, which is not present by default?
11:14 < ghost91> I would need to adjust the system
11:15 < ghost91> same thing if teeworlds starts using different libs
11:15 <@minus> well, if you use a fixed version or pay attention to version changes or just test stuff before releases it shouldn't be a problem
11:15 < ghost91> hmm
11:15 <@minus> for automated dev builds it;s not much of an issue if something breaks
12:49 < BotoX> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/235
12:49 < BotoX> amazing
12:50 < BotoX> Oh ooop, that was 3 years ago :o
13:20 < ghost91> minus: I think I have a more or less portbale version of it now :)
13:21 <@minus> mh?
13:23 < ghost91> as long as we do not add any libs other libs and as long as freetype does not, it should work on all os x that we support
13:24 < ghost91> I will send a pullrequest for that modified make_release.py
14:00 < ghost91> minus: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1208
14:01 <@minus> CS:S now, later
14:01 < ghost91> :D
14:02 < ghost91> I’ll get some food :)
14:03 <@minus> wtf is this shit. disabled voice, yet it's still on
14:03 <@minus> gj valve
14:05 < ghost91> shit happens
14:08 < chsk_> minus: y S
14:10 <@minus> ?
14:11 < chsk_> minus: why not GO?
14:11 <@minus> i don't have GO
14:12 < chsk_> k
14:14 < BotoX> CS: S > CS: GO anyways :p
14:15 < chsk_> lolno
14:15 < BotoX> lolyes
14:16 < chsk_> any argument?
14:16 < BotoX> just a subjctive one 
14:16 < BotoX> I have both and I enjoy CS: S more :p
14:16 < chsk_> other than having ridiculously huge hitboxes in S?
14:16 < ghost91> there’s less eyecandy :P
14:17 < chsk_> brb, but yes, source is a joke when it comes to hitboxes
14:17 < BotoX> cs: go is milking people with all that extra crap they sell
14:17 < chsk_> ...and? :>
14:17 < BotoX> idk :v
14:17 < chsk_> nobody's forcing anyone to buy anything
14:17 < BotoX> Yeah, that's true though with valve
14:18 < BotoX> in some games however, if you want to move forward, you are forced to pay, more or less..
14:18 < chsk_> also it's great because they fund those huge tournaments with case profit
14:21 <@minus> lol chsk_
14:21 <@minus> no linux :(
14:21 < BotoX> that too :3
14:21 < chsk_> minus: give that a month or two
14:21 <@minus> but i agree about the hitboxes
14:21 <@minus> playing headshot-only with deagles
14:24 < chsk_> also, matchmaking
14:24 <@minus> oh, that is nice
14:24 <@minus> i love matchmaking
14:24 < chsk_> you simply cannot not love how broken it is
14:25 <@minus> it is?
14:25 < chsk_> well, most of the time it's great
14:25 < chsk_> it's usually terrible if you soloqueue
14:25 <@minus> we need matchmaking for tw
14:25 < chsk_> competitive matchmaking? :v
14:26 < ghost91> that needs accounts
14:26 <@minus> the "find me a game to play" kind
14:26 < chsk_> well that usually works fine in csgo
14:26 < ghost91> and some sort of rating
14:26 < ghost91> if we don’t want to match people randomly
14:26 < chsk_> but competitive could be way better
14:27 < chsk_> i usually queue alone and i most often get put against 5 premades.
14:27 < chsk_> which is fun when your teammates aren't retarded (which they usually are)
14:29 <@minus> for teeworlds i'd realize something competitive as an external program
14:30 < ghost91> that’s way too complicated
14:30 < chsk_> >steam
14:30 < chsk_> >external program
14:30 < chsk_> checks out
14:31 < ghost91> nobody will start a second program just for playing teeworlds with competetive machmaking
14:31 <@minus> well, irc-based gathers do exist
14:31 < ghost91> yeah, i know
14:31 < chsk_> yep, it works for plenty of games
14:32 < ghost91> hmm
14:32 < ghost91> for teeworlds
14:32 < ghost91> there was a gather bot
14:32 < chsk_> (even csgo)
14:32 < ghost91> but nobody is using it now
14:32 < ghost91> right?
14:32 < ghost91> :D
14:32 < ghost91> however, ingame matchmaking is kind of hard/bad, too, because servers are not controlled centrally
14:33 < chsk_> well
14:33 < chsk_> i gotta say
14:33 < chsk_> in case of tf2
14:34 < chsk_> matchmaking can put you on a community server
14:34 < chsk_> as in, it's capable of it
14:34 < ghost91> hmm
14:34 < chsk_> although not for competitive (this does not exist officially in tf2)
14:34 < ghost91> well, I think there are things of much higher importanc at the moment anyways
14:36 < ghost91> like including all those good pull requests and get the rest of 0.7 done :)
14:41 <@minus> servers don't need to be controlled, ghost91. the game just needs to gather up players and then find a suitable server
14:42 < ghost91> well, but what if during the game the admin decides to do something else with the server
14:42 < ghost91> ?
14:42 < ghost91> that would be annoying
14:42 <@minus> can happen
14:42 <@minus> L4D2 offers the option to play on official servers
14:55 <@minus> oh right. thanks chsk_ ♥
15:17 < chsk_> actually, to elaborate on that
15:17 < chsk_> tf2's matchmaking is only used for mvm now
15:18 < chsk_> and it gives you an option to play for no perks (and that can send you to a community server), or play for loot using a ticket you had to buy earlier (and this will only use valve servers)
15:19 <@minus> $.$
15:19 < chsk_> wut
15:20 < chsk_> actually idk how it works in csgo
15:20 < chsk_> as in
15:20 < chsk_> i never play casual, so i don't know if they let community servers into that mm pool
15:23 < chsk_> minus: so, eh, let's mm when linux version finally gets released
15:24 <@minus> sure
15:24 <@minus> what do you play in CS:GP
15:24 <@minus> GO*
15:24 < chsk_> CS.
15:25 <@minus> Oo
15:25 < chsk_> wut
15:25 <@minus> well you said you don't play casual
15:25 < chsk_> competitive?
15:26 <@minus> casual = all dem mods?
15:27 < chsk_> casual is no friendly fire, no player collision, 10v10 servers
15:27 < chsk_> and they run certain maps
15:28 < chsk_> competitive is friendly fire, player collisions on, 5v5
15:28 < chsk_> and playing there affects your rank
15:29 < chsk_> you can obviously play unofficial modes through server browser
15:29 <@minus> oh, so they CoD'ed up CS
15:29 < chsk_> ?
16:52 < ghost91> heinrich5991: I have an updated version
16:52 < ghost91> would you have a look at it?
