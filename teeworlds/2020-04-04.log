00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> You could use the information from the previous frame and have a 1 bad frame

09:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> `CDataFileWriter::Open` returns true for success and false for failure, vice versa for `CDataFileWriter::Close`. opinions about the better way? @Learath2 maybe?
