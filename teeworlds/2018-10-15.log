08:50 < day> minus: looks like the amount of devs is now bigger than the amount of players :P
10:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> oof
10:24 < minus> or is it?
12:47 < day> Dune: DUNE!
12:47 < day> <3
12:48 < Dune> hey day/dÃ¤y
12:48 < Dune> :-)
12:48 < day> long time no see
12:48 < day> how u doing
12:49 < day> is there a services thta you use frequently where i can add u?
12:49 < day> i know ur not using your steam account :P
12:49 < Dune> sure
12:50 < Dune> irc, line, uuh
12:50 < day> irc? o0 im always on there
12:50 < day> but you never show up as online
12:50 < Dune> recently figured it wasn't joining #teeworlds
12:50 < day> ah
12:50 < day> i kinda read icq ^^
12:51 < Dune> is ICQ still a thing? didn't they discontinue or something
12:52 < day> they did? i only had one or two people on my list. havent seen them in ages though m/b it really is dead now
12:52 < Dune> I'll have to check, I think I have my miranda to autoconnect to ICQ and it broke at some point, but it might be miranda
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> teeworlds discord works
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes, indeed
16:23 < rand> irc did and will survive them all
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> teeworlds 0.7.0 just crashed on disconnect
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - if you have f1 opened and use arrow keys to get previous written message typed to f1 it will also use the arrow keys in the normal menues if possible
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - teeworlds 0.7.0 just crashed on disconnect
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - flag isnt fixed on other players
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - skins are wrong rendered
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - skin system can cause buggy skins (coala template or kitty template with ears/ twinbop)
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - happy eyes and pain eyes look weird
16:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - flags in scoreboard are too bright
16:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - the set server mode (all, favourites, teeworlds) in the browser isnt saved -> reset after restart
16:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - motd is just displayed for half a sec
16:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - chat and hud isnt displayed when menu is opened
16:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - menus are not that clear anymore (chaos for me)
16:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - menues look like ATH
16:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - cant change info ingame (even if its wanted, its just crap for everybody i talked to)
16:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - old maps are broken (design -> bcs tw now has broderadd and the stuff implemented in the client)
16:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> there are many things that the community doesnt like. imo it was a dumb decision to release 0.7 now, as its state looks very rushed and unfinished.
16:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and btw: whats the problem with modding in tw? its an open source game, what do you expect?
16:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - broadcast removed, for what reasons?
16:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - showing id ingame in front of the name looks weird
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - esc menu looks weird
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - client id shown in kill message is also weird
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - sometimes all buttons are hightlighted (as you would hover over every button at the same time)
17:02 < rand> the idea behind client id is to prevent abuse for confusable unicode characters
17:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> support utf8?
17:11 < rand> or simply using I instead of l
17:11 < rand> it's a pain when kicking a bot using a wrong name
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ?
17:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - the markings of some skins arent shown in the team version of the skin (blue, red)
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> - default tilesets got changed so maps are fucked up
17:49 < rand> it could be nice to change gametype without changing the map
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> id suggest fixing bugs before making new ones ðŸ˜ƒ
17:58 < rand> tileset seems fine with correct tileset at both side client/server
17:59 < Sonix-> many tilesets are still the ones from 0.6, meaning, with all the dilate and stuff applied I think
18:00 < Sonix-> but the artists are long gone and we can't retrieve the source files
18:00 < Sonix-> so meh
18:02 < Sonix-> graphics could look much, much better
18:03 < rand> i mean, with the 0. tileset, graphics are fucked up, you can't recognize a tree
18:03 < rand> 0.6
18:04 < rand> but with coherent tileset, it does look like 0.6
18:04 < Sonix-> only grass tilesets are different
18:04 < rand> which is fice
18:04 < rand> *fine
18:04 < rand> duno, maybe its about map data
18:05 < rand> and more likely about how tileset is used
18:05 < Sonix-> so 0.6 grass maps do not look good anymore (grass_main might still be in order), but doodads got different tile orders
18:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes

18:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> this happens
18:11 < Sonix-> and that's okay, since a compatibility break was expected

18:25 < Sonix-> @rand this is how doodads look now https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/247361472634552321/501429897294774278/screenshot_2018-10-15_18-21-46.png
18:26 < rand> looks like what i got after removing the folder ~/.teeworlds
18:26 < Sonix-> and this is how they could look: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/247361472634552321/501430016970588221/screenshot_2018-10-15_18-19-48.png
18:26 < Sonix-> look at the trees
18:27 < Sonix-> and the shapes
18:27 < rand> hm
18:28 < Sonix-> the first image doodads are dilated etc.
18:28 < rand> --
18:28 < Sonix-> the second is straight out from the vector file
18:29 < rand> oh, i see now
18:30 < Sonix-> much cleaner and smoother
19:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> vector o.O?
19:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so you can zoom in and they wont show pixels?
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Sonix: how did u create the good looking picture? Why can't you use that for the official release?
20:02 < Sonix-> android recreated all the data folder images on inkscape, but since it contains bugs and some images do not look like the original files we decided to not use them yet
20:02 < Sonix-> the image was my edit
22:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <getkey> Who made the original files?
22:24 <@heinrich5991> Landil also made them at some point, not sure if he was the original artist
