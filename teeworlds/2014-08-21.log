01:58 < nameless_tee27> how to add this irc to my program ??
02:05 < Nick___> hello there
09:47 < EastBite> matricks: ping
09:47 <@matricks> EastBite: Ping timeout
09:47 < EastBite> :(
09:47 < EastBite> matricks: ping
09:48 <@matricks> EastBite: Ping timeout
09:49 < EastBite> you seem not to accept icmp packets
09:49 < EastBite> I'm currently trying to understand the huffman module used in teeworlds :D
09:50 < EastBite> and this is kind of strange: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/shared/huffman.cpp#L118
09:50 < EastBite> pNode can't be NULL or am I wrong?
09:51 <@matricks> dunno if it can
09:52 < EastBite> but &m_aNodes[... is somewhere no the heap for example
09:52 < EastBite> on the*
09:52 <@matricks> I don't think it can be null ever
09:53 <@matricks> that sounds wrong
09:53 < EastBite> yes
09:53 <@matricks> dunno why that if case is ther... probably just some safty measure
09:53 <@matricks> you don't you test it?
09:53 <@matricks> take 5 sec to test
09:53 < EastBite> I'll add dbg_break in the condition
09:53 <@matricks> erh
09:54 <@matricks> just use a debugger
09:54 <@matricks> gdb ./teeworlds_d
09:54 <@matricks> b huffman.cpp:119
09:54 <@matricks> r
09:54 <@matricks> done
09:54 < EastBite> okay wait
09:56 < EastBite> nope, doesn't break
09:58 < EastBite> I guess that was added by mistake
09:59 <@matricks> or during development
09:59 < EastBite> yep
