03:05 < baka> Sup. Is there any open source bots for the game?
05:41 <+Stitch626> client or server bots?
06:16 < baka> Which simulates player. No matter if on server or client side.
06:17 < baka> I found one on the official forum, but developer didn't published his code.
06:17 < baka> But, never mind.

10:35 < baka> Thanks.
11:12 < daey> theres at least one vanilla bot that melts everything and everyone :P
11:13 <+EastByte> every single one I remember does that (except in old ZOMB)
11:14 < daey> well they all suck at macroing. so they are easily beatable. but getting close to them is not recommended :D
11:15 < daey> well at least on dm1. on every railgun map you probably dont stand a chance
11:16 <+EastByte> wth is a railgun map?
11:17 < daey> a map that has a railgun spawn point?
11:19 <+EastByte> is that a term for the rifle or the gun?
11:50 <+koomi> laser gun
