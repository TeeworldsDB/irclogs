00:03 <@Dune> text looks good
16:59 < day> day just solved the cursor locked in upper corner issue :3
17:00 < day> which can be worked around via inp_grab 0
17:01 < day> 1*
17:02 < day> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1974 see last post for explanation
18:47 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 5 commits to branch master:
18:47 < Teeworlds>  • LordSk (6fb819e): Optimize CClient::SnapFindItem (10x debug, 3x-4x release)
18:47 < Teeworlds>  • LordSk (0863ac6): Save ctrl and shift press state
18:47 < Teeworlds>  • LordSk (e6b30b0): Sort snapshot items, binary search
18:49 <@Dune> nice find, day 
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ^
18:52 < Oy> LordSk how is the map editor going? :D
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Funny you ask, I was going to make a post on the private forum about it
18:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> But it's not done yet unfortunately
18:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I'm gonna clean up what I have for now and we can see how we move forward
18:58 < Oy> good :)
19:06 < Assa> @Oy @LorsSK i need more feedback for the buffered chat ui feature
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Assa: hum sure, what exactly is this feature?
19:18 < Assa> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2127
19:19 < Assa> on the master: if you chat and press HOOK or FIRE, your chat gets buffered and you can play - and if you continue chatting your text won't be lost
19:19 < Assa> the feature is just some ui/visuals for it
19:21 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 3 commits to branch master:
19:21 < Teeworlds>  • oy (a6d25cf): added missing description for str_utf8_skip_whitespaces
19:21 < Teeworlds>  • oy (ea59b18): added str_utf8_is_whitespace to for utf8 whitespaces
19:21 < Teeworlds>  • oy (d3a3d8c): removed duplicate code
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> looks good to me
19:23 < Oy> Assa: last pic looks good. press x to chat message on the right
19:23 < Oy> *left
19:24 < Oy> and doesn't seem to overlap with the broadcast, so it should be alright
19:26 < Assa> Dune hat some concerns about the alphas
19:27 < Assa> what do you mean by "press x to chat message"
19:28 < Oy> better when it start on the left side of the screen. like in the last pic
19:34 < Assa> do you think the text or the annotation should be more transparent?
19:35 < Oy> looks fine that way https://camo.githubusercontent.com/66fa9fb9ee04ca4530bd848782bbeef9a181265a/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f477a7a516c72632e706e67
19:36 < Assa> the last is the current
19:50 < Assa> the formating of the pull request looks terrible ...
20:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> undo commits on your local repo, make the "Implemented #2124" commit again without the problems, force push
20:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> then it will be only 1 commit without the problems in the PR
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> so it looks cleaner
20:19 < Assa> the problem is: everything looks fine in my IDE and i don't know why everything looks so crappy
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> you need to indent with tabs
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> no space indenting
20:27 < Assa> thought i fixed that
20:32 < Assa> the IDE resettet it somehow, its a mixture of both ...
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> you didnt do what I said assa
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> instead of flooding the pr with indent commits
20:44 < Assa> I already did one before you said that
20:44 < Assa> this time I "saved the new perspective"
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> what
20:45 < Assa> do all of my commits get merged into the teeworlds commits? Can't you rename or compress commits to one?
20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> thats what Im saying
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> if you undo your indent commits until you reach 557ec0b
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> then make it so your commit doesnt have any indent problems in the first place
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> then commit
20:46 < Assa> https://www.internalpointers.com/post/squash-commits-into-one-git
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> then force push
20:46 < Assa> i will do a git rebase
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> rebase on what
20:47 < Assa> see link
20:47 < minus> reminder to use git push --force-with-lease if other people can also push to said branch
20:47 < Assa> nobody else can send to my branch, but thanks
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> ye I use it only on my own branches and its just to prevent having little fix commits
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> otherwise you look at git history for line changes and you see "fix indent" instead of "added x feature"
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> are you using VSCode assa?
20:51 < Assa> no, I am using code blocks
20:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> hm ok so you use git in console
20:51 < Assa> yes
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> git reset --soft HEAD~5
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> will keep your changes but go back 5 commits
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> then you can just commit everything in 1 commit, so it has no problems
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> then git push origin --force
20:54 < minus> or use the power of git-rebase
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> if you know how then tell how, cause Im not good with rebase
20:56 < Assa> I actually did what you wrote this time, but before I read it
20:56 < minus> git rebase --interactive HEAD~5, then change all 'pick' except for the first one to 'squash', save, edit the new commit message
20:56 < minus> sliightly more complicated in this case
20:56 < Assa> git push -f assa BufferedChat
20:56 < minus> (than the reset)
20:57 < minus> disclaimer: i don't understand how git works
20:57 < Assa> you don't need to, as long as StackOverflow does
20:58 < minus> i've been in situations where knowing how it works would've been good
20:58 < minus>  especially 3-way merges
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> well seems like the PR is nice now
21:10 < Assa> yes, its not the first time i rebase or reset because of indents
21:44 <@heinrich5991> don't do -f, it's a bad habit :P
21:44 <@heinrich5991> do `git push assa +BufferedChat`
21:56 <@Dune> Assa, @Fudgy: or use Sublime Merge for that kind of commit manipulation :D
21:57 <@Dune> btw if you write "Fix #2124" in the PR it will close it automatically :)
22:09 < Assa> I don't want to automerge stuff, that isn't checked :D
22:09 < barsik> 1 sec
22:09 < Assa> and Dune, that is a really nice comment <3
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> heinrich, that alternative is to create another branch?
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I use a mix of vscode commands and console git Dune
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I downloaded sublime merge but didnt use it yet
22:11 <@Dune> I used to use console git only, @Fudgy, but sometimes when I need to rebase shit I just wanna have something more visual and it's really handy (even if slower) 
22:11 < barsik> Assa
22:12 < barsik> int ShotSpread = 5;
22:12 < barsik> and i can write int int ShotSpread = 7; &
22:12 < barsik> int ShotSpread = 7; ?
22:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I never used rebase
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> whats the question barsik? This seems like a safe value to change
22:14 < Assa> can you read the loop? From where to where does Shotspread go and how many bullets do you spawn?
22:15 < Assa> with shotspread=7 you will spawn 15 bullets and get an exception, because your 'Spreading' array is too small
22:17 < barsik> in float Spreading[] we have trajectories, yep?
22:17 < Assa> we have changes to the angle a
22:17 < Assa> so technically yes
22:18 < barsik> if we have ShoSpread = 4; we have 9 bullets with 5 correct trajectories and others have random trjctrs
22:19 < Assa> yes, because your Spreading array has only 5 values
22:19 < Assa> you need 9 for 9 valid trajectories. The other 4 trajotories are just some memory variables
22:20 < barsik> how we can calculate other?
22:23 < barsik> do you know this?
22:28 < Assa> depends on how YOU want to program the others
22:28 < Assa> simple trick: Spreading = i*0.070f
22:29 < barsik> lol
22:31 < barsik> with grenade similarly?
22:33 < barsik> if i want make comman /spread and write ShotSpread = SpreadCmd;
22:33 < Assa> yes
22:33 < barsik> if(!strncmp(pMsg->m_pMessage,"/spread", 1)) {  pPlayer->m_LastChat = Server()->Tick(); }  else  SendChat(ClientID, Team, pMsg->m_pMessage);
22:34 < barsik> how intercept SpreadCmd
22:36 < Assa> take a look at src/base/system.h you have an str_comp function there
22:37 < Assa> And i don't understand your question
22:37 < barsik> we have /spread n and i would make SpreadCmd = n;
22:39 < barsik> oh When i compiling default sources with bam i have syntax errors in system.c and system.h wut
23:19 <@Dune> what are they?
23:26 <@heinrich5991> `str_startswith` btw
