14:24 < Dune> rand: do you have a good idea of what the client-side issues of 0.6.4 were?
15:14 < rand> what issues ?
15:15 < Dune> security issues
15:15 < rand> I don't
15:15 < Dune> I see, thanks
17:23 < Dune> hey Fisico
17:23 < Fisico> hi Dune ;D
22:08 < Dune> rand: hey
22:08 < Dune> do you run a linux by any chance?
23:13 < rand> Dune: I do
23:15 < Dune> rand: my linux laptop is out of battery
23:16 < Dune> if you have some time, maybe could you look into reviewing PR #1553 under linux?
23:16 < Dune> (https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1553)
23:16 < Dune> just to make sure it works fine there
23:16 < Dune> I believe ctrl+shift+d/ctrl+shift+g show fps graphs ingame
23:17 < Dune> some things there sound a bit OS variable
23:23 < rand> looks like it has effect
23:23 < Dune> is the fps constant enough?
23:23 < rand> wait
23:27 < rand> it's like ultra stable
23:27 < rand> except for small value
23:27 < Dune> sounds good, maybe you can screen that on the github issue as a reviewer?
23:27 < Dune> PR*
23:44 < rand> ok, too sleepy to do better, gn8
23:45 < Dune> good night, thanks for the help!
