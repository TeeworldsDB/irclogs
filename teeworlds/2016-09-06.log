17:15 < Neox> hi, as I'm a Linux noob, can anyone help me with something pretty.. easy? I only need to know where to put my lib file so that the linker detects it. In Windows I just put it in MinGW/lib and it works fine
17:15 < Obani> Neox, do you know apt and aptitude N
17:15 < Obani> ?*
17:15 < Neox> I know apt yes, aptitude? no?
17:16 < Obani> Neox, you ca install 99% of the libs you need from apt
17:16 < Obani> aptitude is the simplest and lightest graphical interface for apt
17:16 < Obani> If you want something more user-friendly, you can use synaptic
17:16 < Obani> apt-get install synaptic
17:16 < Neox> oh I see. Well yesterday I tried to install a few libraries, but I still couldn't compile
17:17 < Obani> Neox, also you need the compilers to compile
17:17 < Obani> That you can get threw apt
17:17 < Obani> apt is as pacman a package manager
17:17 < Obani> It retrieves packages lists from a server and you can download those packages from there
17:18 < Neox> Nah I don't really care about this, I'm using Linux through my VM so idc about the graphical interface things, all I want to do is compiling it :)
17:18 < Obani> I think all the programs you need to have to have your system be complete is in the packages
17:18 < Obani> And more
17:18 < Obani> Neox : if you want to compile, install binutils and build-essentials
17:18 < Obani> apt-get install binutils
17:19 < Obani> apt-get install build-essentials
17:19 < Obani> Neox, what is your distrib ?
17:19 < Neox> I am able to compile. The linker gives me an error because the lib file is missing
17:19 < Neox> Debian
17:19 < Obani> (I'm talking for Debian/Ubuntu)
17:19 < Obani> Neox, if you need a lib to compile, check if you need the "-dev" library or not
17:19 < Obani> e.g : libc6, libc6-dev
17:20 < Neox> how do I even know this? the lib file I need is libmysql.lib in windows, and idk exactly what it is in Linux but i downloaded libmysql.so
17:20 < Obani> Neox, why do you want to compile mysql ?
17:21 < Obani> You can already download it from the packages
17:21 < Neox> My program uses SQL
17:21 < Obani> Neox, install aptitude
17:21 < Neox> I am not trying to compile it, I am trying to use it
17:21 < Neox> Well alright
17:21 < Obani> it will able you to search more easily threw the packages
17:21 < Obani> press "/" to do a research
17:21 < Obani> and enter "mysql"
17:22 < Obani> "n" to go to the next package it points to
17:22 < Neox> it's already installed, wait I'll just launch it
17:22 < Neox> How do I even launch it? haha
17:23 < Neox> got it
17:23 < Obani> basically you can launch any program installed on the system from the command-line
17:24 < Neox> Well I have a lot of libmysql libs I guess?
17:25 < Obani> Neox, search deeper
17:25 < Obani> there's mysql-client
17:25 < Neox> yeah libmysqlclient-dev
17:25 < Obani> Neox, if a program has depencies, it will install it automatically
17:25 < Obani> Neox, you can install mysql directly from there
17:25 < Neox> Oh you mean these are the packages I can install
17:25 < Obani> And if you don't want something precise from the source that is not in the packages, you SHOULD
17:25 < Neox> not the ones I have
17:25 < Obani> Neox, both
17:26 < Neox> Alright, great
17:26 < Obani> those you have are bold
17:26 < Obani> Neox, if you want to start installation, press "g"
17:26 < Obani> it will first show you what actions will be done
17:26 < Obani> Then if it's ok, press "g" again
17:27 < Neox> Wait I'll PM you, I think it's better
17:27 < Obani> haha as you wish
19:29 < Stitch626> hard work to tell a linux newbie what to do - especially in things like this
19:29 < Stitch626> but u forgot about apt-file or similar package, where u can search for files directly
