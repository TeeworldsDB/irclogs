00:04 < bridge_> <jxsl13> are there any good open source observability solutions?
00:05 < ChillerDragon> i killed k3s pretty sure that was the issue lemme know if the servers troubles again
00:05 < bridge_> <jxsl13> Well. For now I'm gonna go to bed
00:06 < bridge_> <jxsl13> but will give feedback
12:01 < bridge_> <reitw> search for eBPF related stuff
12:01 < bridge_> <reitw> https://ebpf.io/applications/
12:01 < bridge_> <reitw> 
12:01 < bridge_> <reitw> there's a short list
12:03 < minus> depends on what you want to observe
12:52 < bridge_> <jxsl13> ðŸ‘Œ
13:27 < bridge_> <reitw> @minus true, but eBPF is amazingly good for that, recent projects are kinda cool
