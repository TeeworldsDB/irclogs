18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> That weak hook pr wasnt even completely correct
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> And there goes a hundreds of hours of work we all put into getting our bridge servers working, now we'll have broken prediction
19:13 < Oy> prediction was already broken
19:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> predicting something while looking smooth is extremly hard
19:43 < ChillerDragon> meh imo weak hook was a good feature :/ any chance we can revert that before next release?
19:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The difference between strong and weak hook seems to be the small that the misprediction isn't really noticable. As Oy already said, the client always used a different order than the server
19:44 < ChillerDragon> its big enough to break maps tho
19:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Not the kind of maps vanilla would care about not breaking though
19:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Just revert the commit in ddrace?
19:44 < ChillerDragon> meh
19:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> oy = vanilla
19:44 < ChillerDragon> not very consistent would be nice if ddrace had same physics as vanilla
19:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Anyway, the commit is not even completely correct
19:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> In vanilla nobody even noticed differnt hook strengths over many years.
19:46 < ChillerDragon> so why fix it?
19:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You'd need to first sum up all the velocity changes in the tick, then post tick go over and do the add
19:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Currently this just makes weak hook a little less weak hook
