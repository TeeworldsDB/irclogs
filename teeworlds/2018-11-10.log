18:52 < Dune> heinrich5991: if you're around, could you explain what that file is for?
18:52 < Dune> normalize_po.py for normalizing a po file to check it into a version control system.
18:54 <@heinrich5991> yes
18:54 <@heinrich5991> it removes the seemingly random order obtained from transifex
18:54 <@heinrich5991> that way, diffs are useful
18:55 < Dune> is the .po somewhere on github though?
18:55 < Dune> I thought there's only the .json
18:55 <@heinrich5991> hmmmm. true
18:55 <@heinrich5991> perhaps I was diffing po files for some reason
18:56 <@heinrich5991> doesn't sound too useful for the repo now that you say it ^^
18:56 < Dune> I see, well that's fine then, I won't stress about not using it :D
18:57 < Dune> should I add the discord git bot heinrich5991?
18:57 <@heinrich5991> yes, you can do that
18:58 < Dune> aight, I'll work on it then
18:58 <@heinrich5991> but I think github can also send notifications directly, without a bot
18:58 < Dune> thx
18:58 < Dune> yeah, that was my plan
18:58 <@heinrich5991> webhooks or so
18:58 <@heinrich5991> ah
18:58 < Dune> not on IRC tho
18:58 <@heinrich5991> yes, also IRC
18:58 <@heinrich5991> they have separate support for that IIRC
18:58 < Dune> oh :0
18:59 < Dune> not sure what is most appropriate
19:00 <@heinrich5991> hm. too easy
19:00 < Dune> wooo
19:00 <@heinrich5991> was already set up :D
19:00 < Dune> haha
19:00 <@heinrich5991> was only being blocked by channel flags
19:00 < Dune> ho, nice
19:00 < Dune> someone deemed it too spammy?
19:00 <@heinrich5991> "Note: GitHub Services are being deprecated. Please contact your integrator for more information on how to migrate or replace a service with webhooks or GitHub Apps."
19:00 <@heinrich5991> is a note on the page btw
19:01 < Dune> huh
19:01 <@heinrich5991> (only +n was relevant)
19:30 < laxa> emotes are kinda spammy, text would be better
19:31 < Dune> emotes, laxa?
19:31  * laxa this
19:31 < laxa> wait no
19:32 < laxa> the way the bot talks I mean
19:32 < Dune> yeah, but that's webhooks, a real bot user would have to be hosted somewhere if i'm not mistaken
19:32 <@heinrich5991> those are notices and kinda reserved for bots
19:32 <@heinrich5991> what client do you use?
19:32 < laxa> mIRC and irssi
19:33 < laxa> and both of them trigger HL on notices
19:33 < laxa> which is kinda bad imo
19:33 <@heinrich5991> oh wow
19:33 < Dune> ah :/
19:33 <@heinrich5991> yes, that's bad
19:33 <@heinrich5991> I'll change it to regular messages then
19:33 < Dune> you can?
19:33 < laxa> I think its better options if that's possible
19:33 < minus> does Dune have an auth yet
19:33 < Dune> I always did :<
19:33 < Dune> my auth is dune
19:34 <@heinrich5991> even logged in right now

22:12 <@Dune> heinrich5991: it seems like it still gives a notice for commits
22:13 <@heinrich5991> no
22:13 <@heinrich5991> that's not a notice
22:13 <@Dune> oh, nevermind, that's a ping haha
22:13 <@Dune> same color, sorry
22:43 < teewar> hello
22:43 <@heinrich5991> hi
22:43 < teewar> is there any info regarding src code
22:43 < teewar> i want to compile it
22:45 < teewar> ok nvm having a look at wiki
22:46 <@heinrich5991> wiki? ^^
22:46 <@heinrich5991> what version do you want to compile?
22:46 <@heinrich5991> 0.7 can be compiled with bam 0.5
22:53 <@Dune> wiki = https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything I assume
23:00 < teewar> isnt 0.6.5 the latest?
23:01 <@heinrich5991> 0.6.5 is also a latest
23:01 <@heinrich5991> it can be compiled with bam 0.4.0, bam 0.5.0 and cmake
23:02 <@heinrich5991> which platform are you on?
23:02 <@heinrich5991> linux, windows, mac?
23:03 < teewar> @Dune lol segfault
23:03 < teewar> i joined somewhere
23:04 < teewar> found 0.7 on github. im running linux @heinrich5991
23:05 <@heinrich5991> then cmake will suit you:
23:05 <@heinrich5991> in the source directory:
23:05 <@Dune> yeah teewar
23:05 <@heinrich5991> mkdir build
23:05 <@heinrich5991> cd build
23:05 <@Dune> it's probably my server
23:05 <@heinrich5991> cmake ..
23:06 <@heinrich5991> make
23:06 <@Dune> i'm making people crash right now
23:06 <@heinrich5991> which segfault do you use?
23:06 <@Dune> are you juanito?
23:06 <@heinrich5991> datafile stuff?
23:06 <@Dune> pGameData
23:06 <@heinrich5991> k
