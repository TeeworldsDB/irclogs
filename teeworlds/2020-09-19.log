11:50 < ChillerDragon> yo Oy wanna break compability w old clients and introduce the old name sys again? :)
11:51 < ChillerDragon> lets make a poll!
11:52 < ChillerDragon> btw what is ur name is it oy like on github or Oy like on irc?
12:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> tbh i don't like breaking compatibility w/ old clients.
12:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> nobody does, it's only done when neccessary
12:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> but i feel we lose more by keeping it this way.
12:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> we dont keep compability if we add namehcnages
12:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> we just need to use the hack for old clients, they cant change name but can receive name changes by getting a disconnect packet, then a connect packet with the new name
12:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> we dont break compability if we add namehcnages*
12:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> yeah, i don't like that as well (but i still think we should do it
12:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i use this technique since forever on my server
12:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> are you able to change name for local player as well
13:08 < Dune> this would break pings btw
13:08 < Dune> ah nvm talking about something else
13:23 < Oy> that hack can't change names for local players
13:24 < Oy> ChillerDragon: both is fine
13:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oy: not needed, those who cant change names dont need it
13:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> only old clients will receive the hack, but they also cant change name, so not a problem until a new major release
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> we mark it with TODO 0.8: remove me
13:45 < Dune> wait, am I understanding this correctly in that players names would be desync'd? like some players see X under Y name, some other under Z name?
13:49 < ChillerDragon> nah Dune new clients use a sane name change packet and all good. And for old clients there is a reconnect emulated so they can pick up the name change as well.
13:50 < ChillerDragon> but yea hacky backwards compability in vanilla servers would be kinda meh
13:50 < ChillerDragon> it currently still isnt too appealing to update to 0.7 :/
14:16 < Oy> it's not about clients being able to change their names, it's just https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2744
14:17 < Oy> and the hack doesn't work for the client which name you change
14:17 < ChillerDragon> oh yea
14:27 < ChillerDragon> yo are there any plans on being more open about the graphics? Like tracking the source files on github and maybe a more permissive license?
14:28 < ChillerDragon> And how does the license work exactly can i publish recreations of the mapres under CC0 or public domain or am i forced to use CC-BY-SA 3.0 ?
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> > we just need to use the hack for old clients, they cant change name but can receive name changes by getting a disconnect packet, then a connect packet with the new name
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> > are you able to change name for local player as well
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> > that hack can't change names for local players
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> > Oy: not needed, those who cant change names dont need it
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> 
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> I strongly disagree with the last sentence. Right now I cannot show a infClass class name in clan tag but it was possible in 0.6.
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Also I would like to rename offensively names players or add more info to a name to be shown in score table.
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> *named
14:33 < Dune> avoid discord marking btw, doesn't work
14:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> It's not discord marking but absence of multiline in IRC I guess.
14:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> IRC still don't have it, right?
14:34 < Dune> the protocol didn't change since like 1999 so yeah :P
14:34 < Dune> and yeah it's discord marking
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Citing with > was common from early 90'
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> It's not new. But I've got that about multiline
14:35 < Dune> use \> then, not the discord feature :)
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> I use >
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Maybe discord is changing it to something different
14:35 < Dune> yes, hence the antislash ;)
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> or a bridge
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> So it's a bridge issue then.
14:37 < ChillerDragon> for me it looks as weird in discord as it looks in irc
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> We've digressed greatly
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> That's why I don't like to talk on IRC bridges, people tend to talk about protocol and what I am doing wrong and not focus on what I am telling them.
14:38 < ChillerDragon> ^^
14:38 < ChillerDragon> probably otherwise you would get no response at all seems like no one is here that has something to say about ur message
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> No response at all is better for me than a conversation on formatting and then nothing else.
14:39 < ChillerDragon> Dune u know who is responsible for the gfx stuff?
14:39 < ChillerDragon> Landil stil alive?
14:39 < Dune> no
14:39 < Dune> we have a few artists sporadically active
14:39 < ChillerDragon> Zatline in charge?
14:39 < ChillerDragon> who can i talk to about license and stuff
14:40 < Dune> he's in charge of some stuff yeah
14:40 < Dune> probably non artists can answer license questions as well?
14:40 < ChillerDragon> k then ill just wait for a response here
14:51 < Dune> ChillerDragon: well for one lots of assets we don't have the source of anymore afaik, and some artists have been clear that they don't want to publish sources anyway
14:52 < Dune> we had some arguments about this a year ago or so, and it was a conclusive no
14:52 < Oy> all 0.7 graphics are released under CC-BY-SA 3.0
14:52 < Oy> that also applies to all derived work
14:53 < Oy> a list of the authors is in the license file
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> basically feel free to copy and modify, make sure to make the origin clear
14:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> (don't quote me on that)
14:58 < ChillerDragon> and inherit the license right?
14:59 < ChillerDragon> So if i create teeworlds like art i am not allowed to use the CC0 license right?
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> if you create a new asset in the teeworlds art style, no, if you base it apon an existing one with that license, yes
14:59 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/images/blob/master/realistic/transparent/doodads/bush_big.svg
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> if you create them from scratch they can be in CC0, but releasing them inside the vanilla repo might be a problem.
14:59 < ChillerDragon> if i created this from scratch is it new or based on tw?
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> other than that you can use CC)
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> CC0*
15:00 < ChillerDragon> but if i create the same graphics from scratch isnt that basing on?
15:00 < Oy> If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original. 
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> there is a fuzzy line, if it's too close to an original you might run into problems
15:01 < Oy> if you draw it yourself you can use whatever you want
15:01 < ChillerDragon> even if it looks darn close?
15:01 < ChillerDragon> sounds like a loophole to me
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> well it you traced it then it is reproduce, which is the same as transform.
15:01 < ChillerDragon> well i guess ill just go with CC-BY-SA 3.0 to be safe
15:02 < Oy> grey zone, you need lawyers for that and y court :P
15:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> so they can't look the same. but they can be in the same style
15:02 < ChillerDragon> i didnt trace but maybe i will in the futuzre
15:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @ChillerDragon do you know songs that have darn equal sounds in them? You can lookup some funny lawsuits
15:02 < ChillerDragon> omg thats why i want fokin CC0 to avoid legal shit
15:02 < ChillerDragon> so that i can allow others to use my graphics and built upon them
15:03 < ChillerDragon> but k CC-BY-SA 3.0 isnt too bad i just dont know how far it goes.
15:03 < ChillerDragon> So if i upload tw gameplay to yt without crediting teeworlds artists i can get into legal trouble?
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> gameplay overall is a grey area
15:04 < ChillerDragon> ok then a animation
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> then yes i think
15:04 < Oy> initially Landil wanted non commercial, we went for CC-BY-SA 3.0, it's ok i think
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> you can get in trouble if somebody really enforces it
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> but i doubt it
15:05 < ChillerDragon> doubt anyone would ever enforce but i would like to stay on the safe side also one the original author agree with
15:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> better safe then sorry
15:05 < ChillerDragon> yes
15:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *than
15:06 < ChillerDragon> so CC-BY-SA 3.0 it is i like giving credits anyways it just forces everyone who uses my shit to do the same huh
15:06 < ChillerDragon> so if one uses my recreations of tw graphics who has to be credited?
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> a link to your github might cover all case if you have made your credit inside your repo
15:07 < ChillerDragon> oh true bcs crediting me also credits the upstream
15:07 < ChillerDragon> :brain:
15:08 < ChillerDragon> one LICENSE file in the root might be sufficiant i guess
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> sounds about right
15:09 < ChillerDragon> ill quote u on that @TsFreddie ur now officialy my lawyer lol
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> well shit
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> but again, i don't think anyone would actually get you in trouble.
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> so i might be safe TM
15:10 < ChillerDragon> thanks lawyer
15:10 < ChillerDragon> hope its ok if i dont pay u today 
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> well if you can help testing my PR that would be great
15:11 < ChillerDragon> the txt render?
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> ye
15:11 < ChillerDragon> how to test
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> download the artifact and play with it. that's it..
15:11 < ChillerDragon> k
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> if something looks weird it is probably a bug. since it should looks identical to before
15:13 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1600521172.png
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> oof
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> github action wasn't screaming at me. let me check
15:17 < ChillerDragon> yea seems like the arch compiler is showing more warnings than github actions they bother me for a while now
15:18 < ChillerDragon> im arch noob tho @heinrich5991 might have more clue
15:18 < ChillerDragon> or Ryozuki nobo
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> oh i get it, i used the wrong function
15:18 < ChillerDragon> cool does that mean i actually found something xd
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> yep
15:20 < ChillerDragon> found something else
15:20 < ChillerDragon> cant see first character i typed in chat
15:20 < ChillerDragon> in the input field
15:21 < ChillerDragon> boi i hope ur legal skills are as good as my testing skills
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> this is weird. i can see the first character just fine.
15:22 < ChillerDragon> hmm
15:23 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1600521760.png
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> nice second screen
15:24 < ChillerDragon> ikr xd
15:24 < ChillerDragon> having not the same res is the worst
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/756868326587760650/unknown.png
15:24 < ChillerDragon> weird 
15:25 < ChillerDragon> go send ur name pls
15:25 < ChillerDragon> what os r u on?
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> windows
15:25 < ChillerDragon> what is different that could cause the issue?
15:25 < ChillerDragon> maybe someone else should test
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> idk, what language are you using
15:26 < ChillerDragon> default
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> and resolution
15:26 < ChillerDragon> like english
15:27 < ChillerDragon> 3840x2160
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> 返刃丸抵次
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> did you want this
15:28 < ChillerDragon> AHA
15:28 < ChillerDragon> no u got it good catch
15:28 < ChillerDragon> on my fullhd screen it works
15:28 < ChillerDragon> so its a res issue
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> what
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> i tested 4k it was fine. uhh
15:29 < ChillerDragon> maybe on windows idk
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> sad emoji. someone else should test this
15:31 < ChillerDragon> i wish fixing res was easier in tw https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1600522215.png
15:31 < ChillerDragon> i mostly have to dive in the settings.cfg
15:32 < ChillerDragon> nvm i take it back
15:32 < ChillerDragon> its actually pretty good
15:33 < ChillerDragon> in 0.7 based u just have to press s for settings and it will remember gfx tab since u messed it up there then press u arrow as much as possible to set up highest supported res and f1 quit
15:33 < ChillerDragon> very convienient actually
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in 0.7 ctrl+shift+q still exists
15:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> boss key
15:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Why was it removed in ddnet? I use it all the time =\
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Ye, i also dont understand
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I tried to run ddnet on a public machine at the institute, it ran with 4 fps, i tried to quit using mouse and via f1 quit, because the shortcut didnt exists anymore
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> f1 quit was also kinds hard, keys were taking twice or not at all xD
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> due to the hard laggs
16:02 < ChillerDragon> Oh yea f1 quit can be tricky on low speced machines also had that when running 4k on a raspberrypi xd
16:03 < ChillerDragon> yea in 0.7 there is also esc and q to quit
16:03 < ChillerDragon> but somehow i rly got used to f1 quit that became my main way of closing tw like normally not in some weird broken cases. Its probably a bad habit since it does not show a warning when there are unsaved maps in editor :/
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> i still don't know what happened with you missing a character.
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> don't you hate bugs that you cant reproduce
17:48 < ChillerDragon> they are the best
17:49 < ChillerDragon> if it works for u there is no need to fix :feelssmartman:
18:13 < Oy> do you press up to show the last input instead of typing everything again? probably related to that
18:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> good idea, i can test that
18:16 < ChillerDragon> good catch oy
18:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> oy, what do you think about the water/liquids issue?
18:19 < ChillerDragon> ah no i found a way to reproduce
18:19 < ChillerDragon> @TsFreddie spam as many @'s as u can
18:19 < ChillerDragon> to cause the bug
18:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> "@"?
18:19 < ChillerDragon> or probably just a line wrap needed idk
18:19 < ChillerDragon> so when i start client fresh all good
18:20 < ChillerDragon> when i then send the message "@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@.." it breaks
18:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> got it
18:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> i see
18:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> good catch. will fix.
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> oh hey it is not even my fault. it happens on master too
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> chat really need some rework, but yeah, i can fix that first.
18:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> is this time of the year we rework chat :D
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> do you guys rework that every year :/
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's an exaggeration, but chat gets a lot of work. we also had a rework on 0.7 release
18:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> i don't what to redesign it, but it could be cleaner.
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> one question, since you cant change weapon when chatting. what about using scroll wheel to scroll chat history.
18:40 < ChillerDragon> o.O
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> or am i missing something.
18:41 < ChillerDragon> not bad actually I would research more on possible problems tho
18:41 < Oy> @Stiopa yeah, sounds like a good idea, but has to be designed good :)
18:42 < ChillerDragon> i mean chat blocks all binds so even custom scroll binds do not work
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> isn't that how it works in games usually? when you're typing custom commands don't work too well
18:43 < ChillerDragon> ?
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> do you expect scroll wheel to select commands?
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> i think games usually bring up cursor during chat. so the chat part is actually just UI elements, and you can select text in history and everything.
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> (why am i suggesting design changes
18:46 < ChillerDragon> )
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> i feel like if we already have scrollregion. we can use that and the new align feature in textrender to do some pretty good UX while not using as much code as before.
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> \> do you expect scroll wheel to select commands?
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> i didn't get what you mean by
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> > when you're typing custom commands don't work too well
