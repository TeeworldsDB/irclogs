18:02 < gg_> hi guys who have coffee(infectionZ dev) skype ?
18:02 < gg_> i want buy him mod
18:03 < Obani> gg_, do you think you're gonna do ?
18:04 < magneticduck> resell it on the black market probably
18:04 < gg_> yes why ?
18:04 < gg_> isnt it private ?
18:04 < Obani> gg_, I would be the mod creator, seeing your behaviour I would just ignore you
18:04 < Obani> gg_, so why are you asking for it in public ?
18:05 < magneticduck> wait now I'm confused
18:06 < gg_> idk i just i didnt know who is coffee i dont who everyone here im new on irc
18:06 < magneticduck> buying access or rights to the source of a derivation made to teeworlds sounds reasonable 
18:07 < gg_> why you guys attack me :( ?
18:07 < Obani> gg_, because you enter a FREE/open-source community and yell at us to buy some mod
18:07 < gg_> ah
18:07 < magneticduck> Obani: teeworlds isn't copyleft licensed
18:07 < gg_> sorry
18:07 < magneticduck> many mods are not FOSS
18:07 < Obani> magneticduck, it's just civism
18:07 < magneticduck> no it's not
18:08 < Obani> it is
18:08 < gg_> so whats i must to do ? can you plz learning me ?
18:08 < Obani> You don't enter an irc channel saying "hi can I buy this mod ?"
18:08 < magneticduck> civic behaviour is simply to restrict the license
18:08 < magneticduck> s/restrict/adhere to
18:09 < Obani> No
18:09 < Obani> This is applying to the law
18:09 < gg_> ok sorry guys dont fight together
18:09 < gg_> i didnt know anything about this title
18:10 < Obani> dude
18:10 < Obani> matricks really used such a license...
18:10 <@heinrich5991> gg_: I don't know who Coffee is, but I don't think they're on this IRC channel
18:10 < gg_> so know what i must to do somone make me light
18:10 < Obani> I love the game he made but damn it...
18:11 < magneticduck> was it news to you that teeworlds is not copyleft?
18:11 < gg_> heinrich5991: i dont know who coffee is too
18:11 <@heinrich5991> mh :S
18:12 < Obani> magneticduck, never tried to look at the license, never tried to touch anything
18:12 < gg_> -_-
18:12 < gg_> Obani: guide me
18:12 < magneticduck> it's relatively rare to find GPL'd games
18:13 < Obani> magneticduck, nop
18:13 < Obani> At least famous ones
18:13 < Obani> gg_, where to guide you ?
18:13 < gg_> in pv
18:13 < Obani> You're talking about someone I don't know, on a mode I don't know
18:13 < Obani> Search on github, forum
18:13 < Obani> I don't know !
18:13 < magneticduck> 'nop'? Can you enumerate a few in that case? 
18:13 < gg_> i didnt find any thing
18:14 < Obani> magneticduck, minetest
18:14 < gg_> ok tnx dont fight together
18:14 < Obani> after that I have no faith to search
18:14 < Obani> Maybe stk
18:14 < Obani> maybe warsow
18:14 < Obani> maybe tremulous
18:14 < Obani> maybe many other
18:18 < magneticduck> that's good to know
18:19 < magneticduck> I'm still under the impression that most aren't, but I would have to get some statistics for that
18:19 < Obani> magneticduck, If you don't know many free-games, I can open you this world
18:20 < Obani> I'm this kind of ultras that are nearly only in this world
18:21 < magneticduck> rephrase?
18:21 < Obani> ?
18:33 < Obani> magneticduck, what do you mean ?
18:33 < Obani> Was my sentence an incorrect english ?
18:33 < magneticduck> I didn't understand your last sentence
18:34 < Obani> I first said I was an ultra
18:34 < Obani> Which means I can be kind of extreme in my behaviours
18:34 < Obani> And I said I was an ultra that was nearly only in this world
18:35 < magneticduck> ah, that word isn't really used in that context
18:35 < Obani> var this world = free/open-source communities
18:35 < magneticduck> heh, var declaration?
18:35 < magneticduck> surely you'd want a const for that?
18:35 < Obani> Yes
18:35 < Obani> sorry
18:35 < Obani> I'm new to those things
18:36 < Obani> But the var can be modified
18:36 < Obani> this_world isn't a const
18:36 < magneticduck> you're just substituting the term into a sentence
18:37 < Obani> If I want to be abled to use it again in other ways, better make it a var
18:37 < magneticduck> sure, if you want to use it as a mutable variable
18:37 < magneticduck> but it seems to me like you don't
18:37 < magneticduck> it's always good practice to keep your code as concise as possible
18:37 < Obani> :'(
18:38 < Obani> Not false
18:38 < Obani> Thanks for saying that, I never used const while I should
18:40 < magneticduck> a good guideline for effective programming is to do as much as possible with as little as possible -- state your intentions precisely and with as many restrictions as you can muster, and you'll be able to discussion abstractions with more clarity
18:41 < magneticduck> s/discussion/discuss
18:46 < Obani> yeeeeh
18:46 < Obani> It's always gratifying to make a little bit of clean-up
18:46 < Obani> When it is over
18:46 < magneticduck> that's a little abstract, and I might not be expressing it correctly
18:46 < magneticduck> a simpler idea is this: if your code is more restrictive, it guarantees more about how you use it
18:48 < Obani> magneticduck, Yeah, I got it
18:48 < magneticduck> by restricting your usage of the code, you're able to catch bugs earlier -- most buggy code is buggy in more than one sense, so if you start reducing dimensions of freedom, you'll catch a disproportionate number of bugs
18:48 < Obani> I just got used on the engine I began working with to manipulate vars
18:49 < Obani> And never thought about using constants
18:49 < Obani> var are more permissive (the term I was looking for to describe TW's license), but you quickly get lost into them
18:50 < magneticduck> WTFPL is the most permissive license
18:51 < Obani> know it
18:51 < Obani> It's the license of most Minetest mods lol
