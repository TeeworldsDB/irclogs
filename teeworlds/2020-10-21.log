09:59 < ChillerDragon> I sometimes wish system.c had a vstr_format and a vdbg_msg 
10:00 < ChillerDragon> am i doing something wrong if i want that?
10:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> v for vector or virtual?
10:18 < ChillerDragon> vargs
10:19 < ChillerDragon> u know like vprintf and so on
10:19 < ChillerDragon> va_listy
11:06 < Dune> Aren't they already variadic?
11:13 < ChillerDragon> i had a hard time to create a wrapper func
11:13 < ChillerDragon> but seems like i built it my self runs fine so far https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/vdbg_msg
11:15 < ChillerDragon> im not good with the terms Dune but ye dbg_msg is variadic i guess same as printf is but i needed vdbg_msg for the case u need vprintf for
11:15 < ChillerDragon> if u want to pass arguments from one variadic func to another
11:16 < Dune> Ahh
12:05 < ChillerDragon> omg min() does not support enums :/
12:05 < ChillerDragon> what is going on today normally i dont reach limits of best game engine
12:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I am pretty sure thats a c++ limit
12:12 < ChillerDragon> :/
12:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it does, just use (int)SOME_ENUM
12:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Just cast it(tm)
14:01 < ChillerDragon> oh cool
14:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I thought you wanted to find the min in any enum
14:18 < ChillerDragon> ah nop
18:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> can sb send me the link to heinrichs backup map repo?
19:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> got it https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> ChillerDragon I find it funny your PR doesn't pass tests xd
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> Not saying it invalidates the tests, the tests ofc sometimes break but I find it funny nevertheless considering the change is so small
23:40 < ChillerDragon> its not ofc that tests sometimes break
23:40 < ChillerDragon> its ridicouls how often brew update fails the CI i dont rly know on whos side the issue is because on my mac brew never made trouble
23:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> macos-latest and ubuntu-latest got updated
23:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> macos-latest on the 17.10
23:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so 4 days ago
23:42 < ChillerDragon> so its expected to fail then?
23:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes and no, it's a new os, it higly depends on the updates
23:43 < ChillerDragon> maybe we should do like ``brew update || true``
23:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ubuntu probably still works
