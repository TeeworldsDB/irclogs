12:16 < drumcode303> hello. what an awesome game! just stumbled upon it on Solus :)
12:18 < drumcode303> i have 2 questions: 1. what jump/defrag maps was used in this video? and are there more like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff-Pi7RD9pM  and 2. how would I alt+tab out of the game instead of quitting?
12:20 < drumcode303> addition for question 1: i mean the non-tdm map that was used at the end, pure jumping/swinging
13:55 < deen> drumcode303: don't know the name of the map, but that's the race mod or something similar
14:00 < drumcode303> i am just watching a video you of right at the moment :D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCP_Wj-ILtY
14:01 < drumcode303> and thanks. any way to switch out of the client?
14:26 < deen> alt-tab? or use borderless window instead of fullscreen
14:26 < deen> or windows-d
14:26 < deen> heh, old video
