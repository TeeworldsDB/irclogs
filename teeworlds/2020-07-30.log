09:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <a gerdoe> bruh
10:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> No c++ errors
10:48 < ChillerDragon> i like the design on lgtm :) @jxsl13 we could fix the errrors and then add it to the CI
10:49 < ChillerDragon> ok well looking closer at the issues they dont really provide a fix do they? Porbably annoying to fix
10:52 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1596106324.png
10:52 < ChillerDragon> thats funny :D
10:53 < ChillerDragon> oh they were bought by github
12:11 < ChillerDragon> oof does one have the dependencies compiled for this https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/scripts/dmg.py#L88
13:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I worked on the SDL_StartTextInput thing for a bit, but got distracted with macOS sdl bugs
14:25 < ChillerDragon> :D we all will never forgot Learath2 heroic macos debugging journey!
14:27 < ChillerDragon> btw @heinrich5991 did you mean UX or actually UI in ur issue comment?
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I wanted to say that it is a bad user interface to let them specify indices
14:28 < ChillerDragon> isnt UI more about looks and UX more about the feel? And your right this is way too technical so its bad UX imo
14:39 < Learath2> There are editor commands now, which would be a perfect place to hide this :)
14:39 < Learath2> And maybe a bucket tool if we want UI for it?
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> bucket tool is different from what ChillerDragon wanted I think
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I was finally able to reproduce #2669 @fokkonaut , even with the vanilla server and sometimes even without rcon login.
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Actually it only happens with gcc 6.3 (on Debian 9) in release mode. Even in release with debug info there is no issue =\
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> lol
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> undefined behaviour? :D
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> can you try in release with debug info?
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> "Even in release with debug info there is no issue =\"
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> oops
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I think I also found the reason for the errornous client id thing. The client id is correct but the server is still sending packets although the client is offline.
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Happens for example when the server is still sending rcon stuff or votes
18:15 < ChillerDragon> good job @redix :)
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @fokkonaut try this: https://github.com/axblk/teeworlds/tree/fix/token_cache
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Seems like this failed because of 2 uninitialized padding bytes at the end of `NETADDR`:
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/1846c74467e8a95a44c1ba972455e4da15083e66/src/engine/shared/network_token.cpp#L238
21:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *THUMBS UP*
21:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Teeworlds is full of these
21:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Assuming paddings, alignments and sizeof stuff all over the place
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @redix how did you diagnose it? Just found a `net_addr_comp` that gives the wrong result?
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Added a ton of log messages... Result was that GetToken doesn't work when doing the heartbeat after rcon login. After fixing `net_addr_comp` it's working for me
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Alright, let me check it later
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> If it works, which I assume, you are the master✌️❤️
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Thanks for looking into it
