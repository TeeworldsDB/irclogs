11:47 <@matricks> why is an accountsystem needed?
17:16 < WolfAlex> matricks, im wondering, why dont we use an auth system like teamspeak, its just perfect
17:17 < heinrich5991> "perfect"
17:17 <@matricks> WolfAlex: proprietary
17:17 < heinrich5991> but yes, I'd also like a public/private key system
17:18 <@matricks> oh.. like
17:18 < WolfAlex> yeah you can select a security level for a server (thats to prevent spamming)
17:19 < WolfAlex> and the security level (example) is the number of leading zeros of the hash of your public key
17:19 <@matricks> still trying to figure out what problem that we are trying to solve
17:23 < heinrich5991> WolfAlex: does that really help though?
17:24 < heinrich5991> either an attacker could precompute these keys or the clients would take too long
17:24 <@matricks> the only thing I can see that could be solved is that friends can find friends and not fake someone else identity... thats about it
17:25 <@matricks> then the question is... is it that big of an issue that it justifies the added complexity
17:26 <@matricks> like the localization :) probably mostly a "non-issue", but added tremendous amounts of complexity to the development
17:27 <@matricks> either way, I need to bounce. gotta check out some colors and then climbing
17:42 < WolfAlex> heinrich5991, yes
17:43 < WolfAlex> heinrich5991, you can bind a reputation on the user
17:46 < WolfAlex> if the key was never seen by the server(or the network of servers) before and the server recognizes a attack it could block tees with low reputation
17:46 < WolfAlex> well this has nothing to do with the sec. level
17:47 < WolfAlex> but i guess if you choose a level that takes about 5mins to generate this would block some join/leave spammers
17:47 < heinrich5991> 5min to generate on what hardware?
17:48 < WolfAlex> regular pc with cpu (not generating with gpu)
21:30  * matricks is back
21:36 <@matricks> this account system stuff is such a can of worms
21:42 <@minus> matricks: good for going fishing?
21:42 < WolfAlex> :D
21:42 <@minus> well, it'd certainly be interesting research
21:42 <@minus> but: time
21:42  * minus goes back to maths of death
21:46 <@minus> or so i said
21:46 <@minus> really gotta quit irc for that to work, gnight o/
22:48 < nameless_tee58> hey
22:51 < nameless_tee46> any developer online who can give me a hint real quick?
23:30 < eeeee> only slow developers are online, sorry
23:34 <@matricks> :)
23:58 < Learath2> he asked for help in 51 left in 56 what was he expecting :P
23:59 <@matricks> thats not how irc works :D
