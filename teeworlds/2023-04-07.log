17:59 < ChillerDragon> does someone know why there are system and game messages? I do not understand their difference.
18:13 < bridge> <Dune> some messages are about the game, some aren't?
18:15 < ChillerDragon> but how is game defined?
18:15 < ChillerDragon> how is the snap and input not game related?
18:16 < ChillerDragon> chat,broadcast,motd i would understand
18:16 < ChillerDragon> but those on the other hand are game
