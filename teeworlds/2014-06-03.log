12:42 < unigame> 0.0
12:42 < unigame> is there anbody?

19:38 < S_a> Hey guys, i have a problem with mouse sens in TeeWorlds. Often ( very often) changes sens automatically. eg. When i move cursor suddenly changes sens to very big, and in a moment changes to normal. its weird and bother. Someone knows how to fix it?
19:39 <@matricks> sounds weird :/
19:42 < S_a> ye, it's really weird
19:42 < S_a> only in teeworlds ;d
19:49 < BotoX> disable mouse accelration in windows?
19:50 < S_a> disabled..
19:50 < BotoX> https://i.4cdn.org/g/1401812358088.png
19:50 < BotoX> HAHAHAHA
19:51 < S_a> it's not when i move fast.. it is "randomly"
19:58 <@minus> BotoX: find the irony?
19:58 < BotoX> yes.
19:59 < BotoX> that's why I linked it in the first place ^_^
20:05 < heinrich5991> nice find, BotoX :)
20:06  * fisted doesnt get the irony
20:06 < BotoX> CEO fired for donating money to people who hate gays
20:06 < BotoX> okay not fired but replaced
20:06 <@minus> "let go"
20:06 < fisted> oh.  i didn't know
20:33 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: what do you mean ? (@github)
20:35 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: you make a transformation of the data in the render function
20:35 < heinrich5991> this should probably be done at loading or somewhere else
20:35 < heinrich5991> but not in every frame
20:36 < BeaR_> yeah, but the map is loaded on-the-fly afaik
20:36  * matricks is getting ready to travel \o/
20:37 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: what do you mean?
20:37 < heinrich5991> the map is loaded in the editor function
20:37 < heinrich5991> the render function used to simply use the raw bits from the map
20:38 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: yes in the editor is loaded completley into the memory, but ingame just the needed data is streamed in
20:38 < heinrich5991> nah
20:38 < heinrich5991> the map items etc. are loaded in the datafile
20:39 < heinrich5991> what you're doing currently is the transformation in every render frame
20:39 < heinrich5991> what it should be instead is to do it once on map load
20:39 < heinrich5991> and store it somewhere, say in the map class
20:40 < heinrich5991> I don't think there has been such a precedent before, with changes to the format in map data
20:46 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: do you understand why I think it's bad?
20:47 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: I see, just read through the map implementation, it's indeed already loaded as it is an item. Could store it in the maplayers maybe
20:48 < heinrich5991> oh right
20:48 < heinrich5991> they're even items
20:48 < heinrich5991> that might make it a bit easier
20:53 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: I could create the envelopes 'OnMapLoad()' and store it in CMapLayers, that's probably the best way imho
20:55 <@matricks> ffs
20:55  * matricks is trying to update the maps on his garmin
20:57 <@minus> :D
20:57 <@matricks> so far I've downloaded an updated windows installer
20:57 <@matricks> installed some windows imaging component
20:58 <@matricks> this inorder to be able to install .net framework 4.0...
20:58 <@matricks> and hopefully I can install the garmin software next...
20:59 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: Background maps is the part behind the game layer (in contrast to the foreground map). This doesn't refer to the background maps in the menu, if you mean them.
21:00 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: I was referring to menu maps
21:00 < heinrich5991> clearing that up now
22:11 < heinrich5991> proper rendering of arabic scripts is so impossible
22:12 <@minus> s/impossible/futile/
22:27 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: try harfbuzz :D
22:27 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: I looked at it
22:27 < heinrich5991> but it seems it doesn't even support line break
22:28 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: yep, just shaping, linebreak and bidi has to be implemented by yourself
22:29 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: how come you know so much baout text rendering?
22:30 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: already thought about implementing it but too much work (:
22:30 < BeaR_> to do it properly
22:30 < heinrich5991> yea
22:31 < heinrich5991> also so much stuff to read
22:31 < heinrich5991> Unicode Line Break Algorithm
22:31 < heinrich5991> Unicode Bidi Algorithm
22:31 < BeaR_> Qt has a nice implementation of this stugg
22:31 < BeaR_> stuff*
22:32 < heinrich5991> but Qt is too haevy as dependency
