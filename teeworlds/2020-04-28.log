12:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Why do flags start floating when gravity is 0 xD
12:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (when dropped)
13:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Why wouldn't they :D
13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> doesnt make sense
13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> when flags are dropped and standing still on the ground, with normal gravity, then turning gravity to 0, they slowly start floating up
13:35 < rand> because it was bouncing just before setting gravity to 0 ?
13:37 < rand> I mean, it may be an explanation 
13:37 < rand> the vertical speed should be null after some time (short hopefully)
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if its standing still on the ground it shouldnt start floating
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yup
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> sounds like a bug
14:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Masters still under attack? cannot register my server in 0.7, in 0.6 tho it works
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> not as far as I know. could that be a routing issue?
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> No idea, well https://status.tw/status still reports firewall stuff
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> is that a report or is that permanently there?
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> report
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its there since i first noticed my server wont register on 0.7
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I know that this is not always there
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I check the page sometimes
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> okay
15:33 < rand> what is your server ip address ?
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 149.202.127.134:7303
15:46 < rand> except for master2 that is offline, my servers succeeded to register on master[134], what message did you get from the master server ?
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> No master servers
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I can register on 0.6 tho
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> So its no problem with my server in general
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> have you tried registering in 0.7 with a vanilla server?
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> No
15:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> might be an interesting data point
15:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Mh
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well I did not change the code in that way so it cannot be the server(?). @MrCosmo could you disable firewall rules?
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it's relatively simple to try with a vanilla server, could you try doing it?
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Appearantly i cant, not at home
15:58 < rand> isp provider might have blocked masters packets :o
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon ?
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> do you experience something like this
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @rand well, as i said I can register the same server on 0.6 (i have multi version support)
16:08 < rand> I thought 0.6 master servers were on a different machines, my bad
16:09 < rand> only the port changed right ?
16:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yes
17:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I have noooo idea why its not working :( xd
17:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> then try vanilla
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it would help in finding out what is wrong
17:34 < ChillerDragon> Any opinions on an rcon command to kill players? Tbh never felt a need for it in vanilla im just annoying reimplementing it in every mod :D
17:34 < ChillerDragon> annoyed*
17:35 < ChillerDragon> ok just realized how ridiculous that sounds^^ ill come back when ill find a use case ...
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> why do you need it in a mod?
17:36 < ChillerDragon> right now i need it in my ctf based mod to kill my bot for debugging purposes
17:36 < ChillerDragon> its mostly useful for killing afk's or dummys/bots 
17:37 < ChillerDragon> might be useful in lms to kill afks blocking the game
17:37 < ChillerDragon> AH I FOUND A USECASE!
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you'd be able to change the gameplay using rcon /econ mods
17:38 < ChillerDragon> true
17:38 < ChillerDragon> and there is also set_team
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i remember it was present in an older version
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> 0.4 or maybe 0.5
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> "kill id"
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 my server can contact the masters local
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but the real server, on my vps cant? but chillerdragons servers can
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and they are hosted at the same host
