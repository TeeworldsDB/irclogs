11:06 <@heinrich5991> possible powerup: being able to hook unhookable tiles
11:07 <@heinrich5991> or even: enemy team can't hook anymore in the next 10/20/30 seconds
11:23 < lvgx> will 0.7 still be released on december 24 ?
11:29 <@heinrich5991> lvgx: I believe that was just an ironical line by minus
11:29 <@heinrich5991> but Oy does want to "release 0.7 in 2015"
11:30  * lvgx was still full of hope
11:30 <@minus> mission accomplished :D
12:01 <@matricks> heinrich5991: got a cooler one, releasing the hook fires the other end so you can nail people to the ground
12:24 <@heinrich5991> I'm not entirely sure what the physics of that would be :)
12:25 <@matricks> [] << there is the window you can throw your physicis ouy of
12:25 <@matricks> :)
12:25 <@matricks> you should never let reality stand in the way of a good game
12:28 < day> the game looks pretty much finished... i wonder if we will see a 1.0 someday :P
12:29 <@matricks> well, there is stuff that I wanted in the game that isn't there, but well
12:29 < day> i dont think the gameplay changed noticably since? idk 0.4?
12:29 <@matricks> you can only say if something is pretty much finished if you have a specification of it :)
12:29 <@matricks> day: gameplay havn't changed
12:29 < day> there was a gigant hook change once, but that was before i started i think
12:29 < day> so probably 0.3ish
12:31 < day> when was 0.4 released?
12:31 <@matricks> dunno, I had a t-rex back then
12:32 < day> *just wondering for how long im playing tw*
12:32 <@heinrich5991> matricks: I mean I'm not entirely sure what logic I'd need to implement for that feature :) it's not really specified enough
12:32 <@matricks> heinrich5991: just tossing out ideas
12:32 <@matricks> feel free to aim them at the window :)
12:34 < day> the one ingame mechanic that always bothered me is. if you fall and you hook another tee that is hooked to a wall. it creates one strange behaving object :P wall <---tee<---tee
12:45 < day> and did i already mention that the nadelauncher needs a big nerf? :P
12:52 <@heinrich5991> it's quite useless in close combat
13:14 <@matricks> day: why?
13:29 < Sonix-> hi
13:29 <@matricks> HI!
13:29 <@matricks> very hi
13:29 <@matricks> so much hi
13:30 < day> matricks: there is no good counter to run and spam. at least i havent seen one.
13:31 <@matricks> be good
13:31 < day> i think i am quite good.
13:31 < day> that makes the problem even worse
13:31 <@matricks> shouldn't be a viable tactic against good people
13:31 < day> because it makes it even easier for the one whos running :P
13:31 <@matricks> and a good balanced map
13:31 < day> it depends on the mode you play i think
13:32 < day> pub ctf5 games are a nightmare
13:32 <@matricks> balancing game after pub games is.. well..
13:32 < day> but on a decently big map it is impossible for a single person to take down a flag carrier
13:33 < day> if that is wanted, then the goal was achieved
13:33 < day> equal skill implied
13:33 <@matricks> don't remember which map ctf5 is
13:34 < Sonix-> you just have to be smarter than the flag carrier
13:34 <@matricks> and it's not a 1v1 game
13:34 < day> matricks: no wonder. it is a bad map 
13:34 < lvgx> <day> matricks: there is no good counter to run and spam. at least i havent seen one. → run and spam = best strat
13:34 < day> but sadly all the rage on pub servers
13:35 <@matricks> how would you change it?
13:36 < day> what i have in mind is change the reload timer
13:36 < day> no idea how that turns out though
13:36 <@matricks> if I remember correctly, all the weapons are balanced to have roughly the same dps
13:37 < day> :o really?
13:37 < day> even the pistole?
13:37 <@matricks> think so
13:37 <@matricks> I know that I took that into account atleast
13:37 < day> i thought the nadelauncher outdp's  everything
13:37 < day> dps's*
13:38 <@matricks> might be that it has an edge if you hit straight on
13:38 <@matricks> don't quote me on it, I would check it out
13:38 < day> well maybe the shotgun is equal, they seem to have a similar reload time and single shot damage
13:40 <@matricks> gun = 8
13:40 <@matricks> shotgun = 10
13:40 <@matricks> grenade = 12
13:40 < day> dps?
13:40 <@matricks> laser = 6.25
13:40 <@matricks> yap
13:40 <@matricks> hammer = 24
13:40 < day> :O
13:40 <@matricks> hammer hurts as hell
13:41 < day> you notice when you play vs bots. if they hook you it is over
13:41 < lvgx> but gun's dps is not constant
13:41 <@matricks> you can only do it for about 1 second
13:41 <@matricks> grenade for 5 seconds
13:41 <@matricks> same with laser
13:41 < day> i doubt anyone gets 8shots out in one second
13:41 <@matricks> day: easy
13:42 < day> thats 480apm :/
13:42 <@matricks> day: easy
13:42 < day> ok
13:42 <@matricks> day: bind mousewheelup +attack
13:42 < lvgx> just heavy spam
13:42 < day> matricks: without tricks obviously
13:42 <@matricks> but then again, gun is the weapon with the longest range
13:43 < day> gun is nice.
13:43 <@matricks> akimbo powerup, fire twice as fast and with auto fire :)
13:44 < day> and unlimited ammo
13:44 < Sonix-> teerminator
13:44 < day> but the aim should suffer
13:45 < day> the bullets need to sweer off in e funktions :D
13:45 <@matricks> no!
13:45 < day> :(
13:45 <@matricks> that goes against the teeworlds core design
13:45 < day> eh?
13:45 < day> what would that be?
13:45 <@matricks> havn't you noticed? :)
13:45 <@matricks> no random
13:46 < day> please. how do you explain me dying then?
13:46 < day> thats all luck!
13:46 <@matricks> haha
13:46 <@matricks> that's the thing, there is no such thing, no random, thats why you see skill differences so easy
13:48 <@matricks> it's one of the fundamentals in the teeworlds design
13:49 < day> i wonder if there really is no random, or if the design decision simply provokes players to strategize even further until they reach a realm of probabilities again
13:49 < day> spamming being such a strategy
13:49 <@heinrich5991> matricks: have you taken the increased hammer delay on hit into account?
13:50 <@matricks> heinrich5991: in 0.7?
13:50 <@heinrich5991> in 0.5 already
13:50 <@matricks> heinrich5991: I just checked the master branch on github
13:50 <@matricks> 0.125
13:50 < day> im pretty sure me and another player managed to hammer eachother to death at the same time, that was kinda funny :D
13:51 < lvgx> day: yes that append to me too
13:51 <@matricks> good
13:51 <@matricks> I would be worried if it hasn't happen
13:53 <@heinrich5991> works with laser as well
13:54 < day> heinrich5991: you mean without a wall bounce?
13:54 <@heinrich5991> yes
13:54 < day> :O
13:54 <@heinrich5991> happens in ictf quite often
13:54 < Sonix-> yep
13:54 < day> i played years of ictf
13:54 < day> never seen it :O
13:55 < day> or just didnt notice it
13:55 <@matricks> good
13:55 <@matricks> again, I would be worried if it hasn't happen
13:55 < rand> :D
13:55 < rand> i might see that in vanilla too
13:56 < day> why was that giant laser bounce delay even integrated?
13:57 <@matricks> for a case that never seem to materialize
13:57 <@matricks> for shooting people around corners etc when chasing
13:57 < day> a double hit? :D
13:57 <@matricks> new super weapon, minitature nuke
13:58 < day> *.*
13:58 <@matricks> new super weapon, small black hole
13:58 <@matricks> new super weapon, cupcake
13:58  * rand catches the cupcake
14:00 <@matricks> you see? noone can resist the cupcake, all other tees are drawn to it
14:00 <@matricks> then it explodes
14:01 < rand> (^ω^)ノﾞ(((((((((●～*
14:03 < day> does quake or ut have any random features?
14:03 < day> do*
14:04  * day assumes that matricks was an avid player of at least one of those games
14:05 <@matricks> played a lot quake 3 and a lot of the inspiration for the design in teeworlds comes from it
14:05 <@matricks> q3 have very little random
14:05 <@matricks> mg and shotgun, and thats about it
14:06 <@matricks> and a weighted random for respawn that can be exploited
14:08 < day> matricks: right the respawn. isnt that random as well in tw? 
14:08 <@matricks> no
14:08 < day> how do i predict where i spawn?
14:08 <@matricks> far away from danger :)
14:08 < day> ... yeah i figured
14:08 < rand> i wonder if I can remove rand() calls on bots without make them more predictible (there already are though)
14:09 < day> but thats impossible to predict with the players knowledge
14:09 <@heinrich5991> the spawn point with the maximal minimal distance to all players
14:10 < rand> day: it's possible on small map like dm1
14:10 < day> lets say dm1 1on1
14:10 < rand> :)
14:10 < day> :)
14:10 < day> game starts 
14:10 < day> if you spawn upper side you have an advantage
14:10 <@matricks> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L991
14:11 <@matricks> day: thats something I've wondered on how to solve actually
14:11 < day> matricks: well for dm1 you kinda did maybe, because the nades are easier to get from the bottom side
14:11 < rand> day: you have to connect after your opponent to get the upper spawn point
14:11 <@matricks> I had an idea that everybody spawns on the same position
14:11 < day> without them the upper position isnt much of an advantage
14:12 <@matricks> to make it fair
14:12 < rand> :D
14:12 < rand> tee explosion !
14:13 <@matricks> and a like 5 second POSITION YOURSELF!
14:13 <@matricks> no collision or weapon fire
14:13 < day> y that would be perfect
14:13 < day> and then only spawn one nade launcher :D
14:14 <@matricks> and gradually increase p2p springyness
14:14 < day> instand hammer brawl ensured
14:14 <@matricks> day: might not be the best option
14:14 <@matricks> day: stay a far and grab some kills with the gun if that happens
14:14 <@matricks> dunno, could be an intressting option atleast
14:14 < day> well in a 1on1 with only one launcher you dont have to give it up for free :P
14:15 <@matricks> anyway, thats one of the things that I didn't solve
14:15 <@matricks> initial spanw
14:15 <@matricks> spawn
14:15 < day> no one did so far i think
14:16 <@matricks> the game design havn't been touched since I left basiclly
14:16 <@matricks> there is a few tweaks that I would do
15:03 < Stitch626> maybe u should do it now?
15:14 < Edible> Stitch626, you talking to me?
15:52 < Stitch626> no, to matricks
16:31 <@matricks> Stitch626: I don't touch teeworlds anymore :)
18:00 < Obani> Did anyone see the bug I reported ? :x
18:01 <@minus> did the connectionless protocol change in the dev version?
18:01 <@minus> doesn't look like it can to talk to the master server anymore
18:01 < Obani> you mean that 2 big bugs were introduced ? awww ><
18:10 < EastByte> minus: here it changed https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/986
18:12 <@minus> updated master1, incompatible with 0.6
18:12 <@minus> on purpose, heinrich5991?
18:12 <@minus> oh i even said to do so
18:12 < EastByte> yea :p
18:15 < Obani> Did anyone see the bug I reported ? :x
19:14 <@heinrich5991> minus: I had a compatible version, but oy might not have merged it
19:21 < Obani> I precised a bit the problem https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1427
19:21 < Obani> afk
19:32 <@minus> Obani: can reproduce
19:34 <@minus> heinrich5991: git bisect?
19:34 <@heinrich5991> git bisect!
19:34 <@heinrich5991> just run git bisect, it'll tell you what to do
19:36 <@minus> uh
19:38 <@minus> ha, my arduino blinks!
19:38 <@minus> so far so good
19:38 <@minus> now, how do i program it
19:38 < day> Dunedune: :3
19:38 <@matricks> :D
19:39 < Dunedune> 3:
19:39 < day> :D
19:39 <@minus> hey Dunedune
19:39 <@matricks> minus: port the teeworlds server to it
19:39 <@minus> too few bits
19:39 < Dunedune> hey minus & day
19:39 <@minus> i only work on 64bit
19:39 < Dunedune> sup
19:39 <@minus> but seriously, how do i program it without the arduino IDE
19:40 <@minus> actually without any arduino specific things, i just want to program it like a normal atmega
19:41 < day> matricks: already done, kind of. at least someone got linux running on an atmega :D http://hackaday.com/2012/03/28/building-the-worst-linux-pc-ever/
19:41 < day> ubuntu only needs 4h to boot
19:43 <@matricks> I ran the teeworlds server on a gp2x :)
19:43 <@matricks> day: seen that :)
19:43 <@minus> well, that's at least 32bit
19:43 <@matricks> minus: nope
19:44 <@matricks> minus: it's 8bit, emulating a 32bit cpu
19:44 <@minus> really?
19:44 <@minus> i thought those things had ARM
19:45 < day> i dont think there is a single 'Atmega' that has an arm core
19:50 <@minus> sweet, makefile & example code set up, works nicely
19:54 < Tobii> minus: b84b8ddfdabba3d2b77d62bdab7d7548e739380f is the first bad commit
19:55 < Tobii> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/b84b8ddfdabba3d2b77d62bdab7d7548e739380f
19:55 <@minus> attaching a debugger and looking at where it fails is probably more useful
19:55 <@minus> also, don't tell me
19:58 < Tobii> https://gist.github.com/saibotu/620c60bf493e5a17bd00
19:58 < Obani> minus, you got the same bug doing what I told ?
19:59 <@minus> yes
19:59 < Tobii> segfault seems to be something different, but caused by the same commit
19:59 < Obani> heinrich5991, what is git-bisect ?
19:59 < Tobii> happens when firering the gun
19:59 <@heinrich5991> it's a command that helps you find out the offending commit
19:59 <@heinrich5991> but apparantly Tobii already did it
19:59 <@minus> shit, forgotten all about ATmega ADC
20:00 < day> minus: the first thing you should do is get a proper atmega programmer and purge that bootloader
20:00 <@minus> day: no
20:00 <@minus> it works
20:00 < day> i hate that platform >.<
20:00 < Obani> there might be something that was displazed in code, cause all sounds are :/
20:09 < Tobii> crash is caused by random_int() returning negative values
20:14 <@minus> nice
20:27 < Edible> want me to  https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commits/master.atom > this channel ?
20:28 < Edible> minus, can I ?
20:29 <@minus> i don't mind
20:29 < Edible> yay
20:29 <@minus> until further notice
22:48 < Edible> its set up now i think, im not sure if the output is likable though, i've seen others use colors and stuff
