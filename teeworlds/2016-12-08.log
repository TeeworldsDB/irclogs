21:35 <+necropotame> Small questions about binaries. Is teeworlds using dynamic link or static ? (for SDL, freetype,...). I'm interested for an answer for Linux, OSX and Windows.
21:37 <@minus> it's linked dynamically on linux and windows. dunno about OSX, but probably there too
21:37 <@minus> windows releases do ship the SDL DLL though
21:43 <+necropotame> Thanks
22:15 < nal> afaik there arent many things that are static
22:15 < nal> unless you get a specified pkg which explicitly states so
22:16 < nal> or an OS where everything is
