16:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Does anyone have the source from all the way back when tw was in C?
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> does https://downloads.teeworlds.com/ not have sources?
17:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> only the engine was in C
17:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> 0.1.0 seems to have cpp for clients already
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> http://downloads.teeworlds.com/teeworlds-0.4.3-src.tar.gz
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> last version with C engine I think
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> hmm no... 0.5.x seems to be C as well
17:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I just need the huffman part
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> TIL there is no huffman compression in 0.4.3 ðŸ˜„
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <a gerdoe> 0.6 base also was written on c mostly
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I took it from 0.5
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 check before "copied refactor to trunk"
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> our favorite bisecting commit

18:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Yes, dissecting all 3 versions of the protocol
19:21 < ChillerDragon> oh wow cool hope u pr it into wireshark :)=
19:23 < ChillerDragon> im a too stupid to bind or can i not overlay a +prevweapon with a compose bind
20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Should be fine
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <a gerdoe> 0.6 base also was written on c mostly (lie, mb)
