10:41 < BotoX> Tell him to get a kimsufi in france
10:48 <@minus> BotoX | I need to watch it ← well then, enjoy~
10:49 <@minus> yemDX`: only thing you (are guaranteed to) get busted for in germany is torrenting german musics
11:19 < yemDX`> minus so if you torrent the madoka movies you aren't gonna get busted
11:20 <@minus> no
11:20 <@minus> most likely
11:21 < yemDX`> most likely
11:22 < yemDX`> is it a real concern 
11:39 < PriZr> Hi all
11:42 <@matricks> o/
11:44 < PriZr> When will the tournaments ctf
11:44 < BotoX> How does game
11:45 < PriZr> DM was and was not CTF
11:46 < BotoX> Yes
11:46 < BotoX> No
11:46 < BotoX> Maybe
11:48 < PriZr> I create a map by type ctf3 and wanted to offer for the tournament
11:50 < PriZrak> And the silence
11:53 < PriZrak> Waiting for an answer. if I'm here
11:54 <@matricks> PriZrak: people are working etc
12:16 < JulianAssange> matricks: i'm not
12:16 < JulianAssange> im in a flight lounge
12:16 < JulianAssange> waiting 4 my flight lol
12:23 < heinrich5991> PriZrak: if you made a map, you could consider showing it in the forums
12:45 <@minus> matricks: yes, wörk wörk!
12:45 <@matricks> wtf is up with TVs today
12:45 <@matricks> they are all internet connected
12:46 <@matricks> f-off!
13:15 <@minus> matricks: ikr. and they're spying on you. also, their UI is fucking unresponsive
13:16 <@matricks> I want an DVI/HDMI input.. and thats about it
13:16 <@matricks> and no freaking "pixel magic"
13:19 <@minus> rather DP
13:19 <@minus> matricks: my dad recently bought a new TV and it had a "computer mode" which turned all fancy shit off
13:20 <@matricks> it's insane how much stuff they are doing with the image
13:25 <@minus> motion interpolation, yuck
13:25 <@minus> looks incredibly weird
13:26 <@minus> now then, time to makes promises for the future
13:46 < heinrich5991> ?
13:49 <@minus> heinrich5991: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/future/promise/
13:49 < heinrich5991> I don't like that page
13:49 <@minus> you do not?
13:50 <@minus> i do
13:50 <@matricks> minus: todays PG movie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBH0sC-k5qI
13:50 < Nimda3> [YouTube] Title: Collision parapente à 100 m/sol | Rating: 0.00/5.00 | Views: 297
13:51 < heinrich5991> minus: do you know this page? http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/promise
13:52 <@minus> looks utterly harmless, matricks
13:53 <@minus> heinrich5991: i do
13:53 < heinrich5991> k
13:53 <@matricks> minus: they both landed fine under the rescue
13:53 <@matricks> but always look twice before you turn :)
13:53 <@minus> :)
13:53 <@minus> not just with flying
13:54 <@matricks> nope
13:54 <@matricks> but it can get kinda complex because you move in 3 dimentions
13:54 <@minus> needs proximity warnings
13:54 <@matricks> there is a system for that is called FLARM
13:54 <@minus> also, predict routes and warn
13:55 <@minus> also, i want self-driving cars
13:55 <@matricks> works for some cases, but some when you are flying on a hang you can almost fly wing-tip to wing-tip
13:56 <@minus> mhm
13:57 <@minus> i still want self-driving cars though
13:57 <@matricks> yeah
13:57 <@matricks> that would rock
13:58 <@minus> no more idiots driving like… idiots
13:58 <@matricks> one of the reasons why I don't like traveling to remote desinations by car is that I have to spend like 6-7 hours behind the wheel
13:58 <@matricks> if I could do something else for those hours, it would be much nicer
13:58 <@minus> totally
13:58 <@minus> also, your ass will hurt
15:05 < BotoX> should've bought a panasonic plasma
15:05 < BotoX> tfw 4:4:4 DVI input
15:06 < BotoX> nearby no input lag, amazing colors, motions are fluid as fuck :3
15:06 < BotoX> power usage obviously is higher though
16:31 <@minus> sshould've bought a 30" 4k 120hz monitor!
16:33 < heinrich5991> where can I read whether I need to upgrade the kernel for security reasons?
16:34 <@minus> kernel changelog maybe
