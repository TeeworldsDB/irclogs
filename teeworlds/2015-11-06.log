00:45 < Fels> poof
20:50 < koomi> "Looking for more master servers, again." <- still true?
20:50 < koomi> I have a largeish box in france that's not doing a whole lot
20:51 < koomi> minus: ^
20:51 <@minus> are you DDoS-safe?
20:52 <@minus> and not with OVH?
20:54 < masoudd_> How can one be ddos safe?
20:55 < koomi> not OVH, and I think I have some DDoS protection thing, never looked into it
20:55 < koomi> so does that mean master servers are attacked regularly?
20:58 < koomi> https://www.online.net/en/dedicated-server/ddos-arbor
20:59 <@minus> not really
20:59 < koomi> I have the "Standard" protection
20:59 <@minus> got an attack once after i set up new masters a few months ago
21:00 < koomi> ok, not so bad then
21:01 <@minus> would be nice if you could provide me with a shell account named twmaster and the ip/port
21:01 <@minus> sending pubkey via pm
21:36 < BotScratcher> New commit: [ prevent lock of the ingame GUI. Closes #828 ] by [ oy ] on [ https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/e98921593bf23886de32ffb2fce9b166a89d6c05 ]
21:36 < Edible> BOTSCRATCHER!
21:36 < Edible> YOU WORKED!
21:36 < Edible> ♥
21:38 <@minus> took a while though
21:38 <@minus> wait no
21:39 <@minus> that wasn't my commit
21:39 <@minus> that's a commit from 2 days ago, Edible
21:39 < Edible> fuck
21:42 <@minus> why not web hooks?
21:42 < rand> x)
21:42 < Edible> ah, i see what the problem is (i think)
21:42 < Edible> is that meant for me?
21:42 < Edible> i dont know what a web hook is
21:43 <@minus> github can post to an api when a commit o.ä. happens
21:46 < EastByte> Edible: in other words no need to grab html
22:32 <@matricks> I must say, the teeworlds forum is really fast loading :D
22:43 <@minus> uhm, yes?
22:48 <@matricks> just saying
22:49 <@matricks> it's snappy
22:55 < Edible> EastByte, im just using rss...
22:56 < Edible> though that would be better if it was doable
22:56 < Edible> still need a bridge though, and since rsstail isnt that costly...
