00:19 < JulianAssange> heh
00:19 < JulianAssange> spam emails starting to use .rtf 0day
04:06 < JulianAssange> siile
04:06 < JulianAssange> ugh
05:54 < JulianAssange> [5338e6cb][server]: maximum number of vote options reached
05:54 < JulianAssange> [5338e6cb][server]: maximum number of vote options reached
05:54 < JulianAssange> what is this
08:38 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: that means that the maximum number of vote options has been reached
13:21 < BotoX> orly
17:13 < Siile> argh, need someone talented to design a map for tee defence
17:13 < BotoX> oh god calculus
17:13 < BotoX> 0=0 and 0=1
17:14 < BotoX> why.jpg
17:14 < BotoX> y''+16y=cos(4x)
17:14 < BotoX> I don't anymore
17:15 < Siile> y is a bitch
17:16 < BotoX> http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y%27%27%2B16y%3Dcos%284x%29
17:16 <@minus> BotoX: i have no idea how to even approach that
17:16 < BotoX> Does anyone have wolfram alpha pro D:
17:16 <@minus> learned it multiple times
17:16 < BotoX> it's pretty easy
17:16 < BotoX> but this one is some special case
17:17 < BotoX> I think I know how to approach it but it'd take a while
17:27 < Learath2> BotoX: umad ? 0 != 1
17:27 < BotoX> fug u
17:27 < Learath2> how can 0 ever be equal to 1
17:27 < Learath2> go back to school pls
17:30 <@matricks> BotoX: no were on that pages does it say that 0=0, 0=1
17:30 < BotoX> ahh
17:30 < BotoX> pls enable colors
17:31 <@matricks> NO!
17:31 < BotoX> just for a second
17:31 < BotoX> https://i.botox.bz/1396279916.png
17:32 <@matricks> where did you get that?
17:32 < BotoX> when I do yp = a*sin(wx) + b*cos8wx)
17:33 < BotoX> when I do yp = a*sin(wx) + b*cos(wx)
17:33 < BotoX> When I calcualte it by hand using ^
17:34 < BotoX> y''p = -16a * sin(4x) -16b * cos(4x)
17:34 < BotoX> yp = a*sin(4x) + b*cos(4x)
17:34 < BotoX> put that in y'' + 16y = cos(4x)
17:35 < BotoX> and pic related happens
17:35 <@minus> try doing a fourier transform. it's right most of the time.
17:35 < BotoX> so I guess yp = a*sin(wx) + b*cos(wx) is wrong here
17:35 < BotoX> minus but that's not what I am supposed to do, what D:
17:35 <@matricks> y'' + 16y = cos(4x) where did that come from?
17:35 <@matricks> ooh.. wait
17:35 < BotoX> that's the umm problem
17:36 < BotoX> wolfram alpha has x in the result, hmmmm
17:37 < BotoX> than this one is a special case which we never did in class D:
17:37 < BotoX> yp = x * (a * sin(mx) + b * cos(mx))
17:38 < BotoX> Is what I should be using, which makes it a lot more difficult
17:39 < BotoX> it's not homework though D:
17:39 < BotoX> got a test tomorrow
18:53 < JulianAssange> sgah
18:53 < JulianAssange> gah
18:53 < JulianAssange> i had
18:53 < JulianAssange> i hate new laptops
18:54 < JulianAssange> the keyboard =[
19:00 < JulianAssange> this one everything is to the left
19:01 < JulianAssange> sp of i type as i normally would..
19:01 < JulianAssange> o rpi;f ype lijke yjos
19:01 < JulianAssange> i would type like this.
19:01 < Maimer_> life is hard
19:12 < JulianAssange> yeah
19:12 < JulianAssange> first world problms yo
19:14 < Maimer> what kind of laptop is it
19:14 < Maimer> and what version of linux are you running on it
19:14 < JulianAssange> acer aspire e1
19:14 < JulianAssange> and ubuntu
21:38 < Learath2> elections over current government won so even more internet restrictions
21:38 < Learath2> which is nice :D
21:45 <@minus> start a revolution
21:52 < Siile> come help me clear some levels in Tee Defence :P
22:04 < Learath2> minus: not with 60% of the population consisting of imported morons
22:12 < JulianAssange> http://www.rojtberg.net/645/repairing-philips-hd4685-kettle/
22:12 < JulianAssange> lol
