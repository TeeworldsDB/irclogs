21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i wonder if scripts/make_release.py is meant for crosscompile from linux or also for native macOS builds
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm if i compile arch=x86_64 on windows it seems to build a 32bit version with 64 bit libs that doesnt launch
23:20 < Dune> ChillerDragon: make_release.py is just to package releases afaik
