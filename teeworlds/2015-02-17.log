04:30 < JulianAssange> minus: it's C not C++
04:31 < JulianAssange> matricks: because the next step is to use it as a string
05:18 < JulianAssange> i mean, to use it as a nul terminated array*
08:01 <@matricks> JulianAssange: why use it as a null terminated array?
10:45 < JulianAssange> because i'm only returning the open ports
10:45 < JulianAssange> not how many
10:45 < JulianAssange> fstd suggested I could just put it all in a struct
10:46 < JulianAssange> which sounds like a good idea
10:46 <@matricks> you are just wrapping something to get it into another format...
10:46 <@matricks> it's just.. weird
10:47 < fstd> wtf
10:47 <@matricks> causes unnessesary allocations etc
10:47 < fstd> for the record, i didn't suggest that
10:47 < JulianAssange> you agreed*
10:47 < JulianAssange> whatever
10:47 <@matricks> that function does nothing but mangling some data...
10:47 < JulianAssange> yes
10:47 < fstd> 04:47:19 [QuakeNet] [msg(JulianAssange)] normally you'd rather remember the size somewhere/pass it to functions which you also pass the pointer into your array                                                   |
10:48  * fstd shrugs
10:48 < JulianAssange> that's all i need that function to do
10:48 < JulianAssange> since when it is used, the return value will be printf'd in a loop
10:49 <@matricks> and why the hell do you need to print it in a loop, using a null terminated array?
10:49 < JulianAssange> in a while loop* <- since it does not return the length
10:49 <@matricks> can't you change that loop?
10:49 < JulianAssange> yes
10:49 <@matricks> then change that loop to loop over an array with length X
10:49 <@matricks> done
10:49 <@matricks> instead of doing loads of weird extra work
10:50 <@matricks> less is more
10:50 <@matricks> the most bug-free code is the code that doesn't exist
10:52 < JulianAssange> you mean, turn it into a function that returns the length, just like the other one?
10:53 <@matricks> remove that outer function as it does nothing
10:53 < JulianAssange> MultiPortScan?
10:54 <@matricks> MassPortScan
10:54 <@matricks> that fuction doesn't really do anything
10:54 <@matricks> *function
10:54 < JulianAssange> it scans ports 1 2 and 3
10:54 < JulianAssange> the actual list of ports is 200 or so
10:55 <@matricks> remove that function, and just use MultiPortScan were you use MAssPortScan
10:56 <@matricks> the only thing MassPortScan is supply a default parameter to MultiPortScan..
10:56 < JulianAssange> yes
10:56 < JulianAssange> do you mean, as a macro?
10:56 <@matricks> no...
10:57 <@matricks> can you show the complete code instead of snippets?
10:57 < JulianAssange> there is no further code that calls MassPortScan
10:58 < JulianAssange> it hasn't been made yet
10:58 < JulianAssange> however, per the uh
10:58 <@matricks> just remove the MassPortScan and use MultiPortScan
10:58 <@matricks> it's just dead weight
11:39 <@matricks> minus: btw, I've been looking into angelscript some more
11:42 <@minus> have you been enlightened yet?
11:42 <@matricks> seems quite nice
11:42 <@matricks> there are some real benefits over lua for example
11:43 <@matricks> I've become more and more an opponent of dynamicly typed languages.. as they suck something fierce
11:47 <@matricks> also, if you do stuff teeworlds where the engine is c++, it's easier to move code from script to engine and back if the syntax is almost the same
11:47 <@matricks> like with c++ and opengl
11:48 <@matricks> it's more or less scripted subset of c++

16:53 < JulianAssange> a teeworlds player
16:53 < JulianAssange> i thought he was friends w/ you back in 2010
16:53 <@matricks> people tend to think that an account system would solve sooo much :/
16:54 < BotoX> idk JulianAssange 
16:54 < BotoX> I don't recall that name
16:54 < JulianAssange> he would crash servers and stuff like that
16:54 < JulianAssange> matricks: i don't understand what to point of it is anyways. to keep names? to keep highscores? who cares really
16:56 < JulianAssange> BotoX: he was the cause of this http://pastebin.com/H6V4bsLh

16:57 < BotoX> not a friend of mine actually
16:57 < BotoX> he did that shit to my servers too back then
16:57 < JulianAssange> we used to troll him
16:57 < JulianAssange> run a dbg server while he was crashing us with all sorts of different stuff
16:57 < JulianAssange> it was fun
16:58 < BotoX> ye w@rmup
16:58 < BotoX> but that's not xangels
16:58 < BotoX> that is issue still isn't fixed though
16:58 < BotoX> if you can spoof ip's you can fill up any server
16:58 < JulianAssange> ok it's xagels not xangels
