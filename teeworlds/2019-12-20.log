15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> getin' hooked by hookers
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> is it possible to generate the python source stuff with a python call?
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> `python datasrc/compile.py client_content_source > src/generated/client_data.cpp`
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> e.g.
21:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> check the function `generate_source` and its call sites in `CMakeLists.txt`
21:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> thx ^.^
21:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I think i could have found that out myself <.< sometimes iam just dumb
21:37 <@Dune> I need a proper palette of colors for the statboard
21:37 <@Dune> that would represent the 5 (or 6) weapons
21:38 < Oy> don't think there are
21:38 < Oy> laser and grenade do, but the others?
21:38 <@Dune> yeah...
21:39 <@Dune> gun has a bit of yellow doesn't it
21:39 < Oy> maybe brown shotgun
21:39 < Oy> yeah a bit
21:39 <@Dune> shotgun definitely has brown
21:39 <@Dune> the issue is the hammer
21:39 < Oy> what about hammer? :)
21:39 <@Dune> pink? :)
21:39 < Oy> :D
21:40 <@Dune> white?
21:40 < Oy> dunno
21:40 <@Dune> it makes a white hit thing but that's a stretch
21:40 < Oy> yeah
21:41 < Oy> just looked at the game png
21:41 < Oy> use the colours of the crosshair?
21:42 < Oy> so white for hammer yeah
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Thats what i was  about to say ðŸ™‚
21:44 <@Dune> okay :)
21:45 < Oy> travis fails
21:46 <@Dune> yeah :(
21:46 <@Dune> not sure what that is about
21:46 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/F1awR3C.png shades of white are terrible
21:47 < Oy> yeah
21:48 <@Dune> `extern int __dummy[(int)(NUM_WEAPONS == 6)]; // make sure there are 5 weapons`
21:49 <@Dune> there's gotta be a better way to do compile-time asserts :p
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> `static_assert(NUM_WEAPONS == 6, "WY U NO 6 Weapons?")`
21:51 <@Dune> that's c++03?
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> no, c++11 ðŸ˜„
21:53 <@Dune> ^^'
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> `#define COMPILE_ASSERT(x) extern int __dummy[(int)x]`
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> guess there is no other way ðŸ˜®
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/abhinaba/2008/10/27/cc-compile-time-asserts/
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> use some AI color palette tool
21:57 <@Dune> screenshotting should copy the file path
21:58 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/NcfEM84.png gotta adjust a bit and make colors more flashy
21:58 <@Dune> when i'll find a UK adapter tomorrow :D
21:58 <@Dune> s/more/less
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> nice
21:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> which is the turkis one?
21:59 < Oy> the new ice weapon :D
21:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *turquoise
22:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> guess hammer is brown and gun is yellowish?
22:00 <@Dune> hammer is white
22:01 <@Dune> Oy: it's for DDRace :D
22:01 < Oy> :P
22:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> gamer client or default? :p
22:01 < Oy> think it was there before ddrace
22:01 < Oy> there was some freeze mod
22:02 <@Dune> oh yeah
22:02 <@Dune> iFreeze
22:02 <@Dune> really fun!
22:02 < Oy> yeah
22:02 <@Dune> probably where they got the idea to use ninja as freeze
22:02 < Oy> yeah
22:04 < Oy> i remember the original author didn't want to relase src code, so i did one for our xyz servers
22:04 <@Dune> oh haha
22:05 <@Dune> should do https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2173 some day
22:05 < Oy> yeah, adding that ice block skin would be good
22:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'd ask a designer for a proper color palette, that's not that hefty of a contrast that burns in the eyes
22:11 <@Dune> > less flashy
22:11 <@Dune> ;)
22:26 <@heinrich5991> please also test such commits on a mac/in a cross compilation environment
22:26 <@heinrich5991> otherwise we'll have to fix the mac build for the next release again
22:27 <@heinrich5991> those changes have the potential to break e.g. the execution of the produced binaries on different machines
22:30 < Oy> when was there a fix for the mac build?
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> which commit?
22:31 < Oy> the fix for travis
22:33 <@heinrich5991> every release feels like we have to be very careful so that the binaries will also run on non-development machines
22:33 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/cbb57765b66477e2a6daf6347e3fd7e9f366ce83
22:33 <@heinrich5991> @Dune
22:34 < Oy> i always did the mac releases with bam+make_release script
22:34 < Oy> the dmg file created by cmake wouldn't work anyway cause it doesn't include libpng16.16.dylib
22:34 < Oy> which is a dependency of freetype
22:35 <@heinrich5991> when I created the cmakelists.txt, it worked
22:38 < Oy>  was freetype installed by brew?
22:38 < Oy> or maybe that dependency came later
22:39 <@heinrich5991> ah yes, it wasn't a freetype installed by brew
22:39 < Oy> i remember freetype didn't always need libpng
22:39 <@heinrich5991> I have a freetype that doesn't show a libpng dependency with otool -L
22:39 <@heinrich5991> how does the make_release.py script handle the libpng?
22:40 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/scripts/make_release.py#L179
22:40 <@heinrich5991> eh, by assuming you installed the libs into /usr/local/lib
22:40 <@heinrich5991> so probably assuming brew(?)
22:40 < Oy> like the other libs
22:40 < Oy> yeah brew
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @Dune what's a good stl drop-in alternative?
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might check that out ._.
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 I think we came to the conclusion that `std::vector` is fine(?)
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._.
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think I'm also using the map
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @jxsl13 eastl
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> and I agree with @heinrich5991 that std::vector is fine
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> (not so much with the rest of the stuff)
22:42 < Oy> in the past brew supported "universal" flag, too bad that's gone
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> > 0x0703 for default value
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so versions have two bytes?
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> digitsÂ§
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm k, you work a EA, Dune?
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> >:D
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> no
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :c
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok ._.
22:45 < Oy> Dune: yeah
22:47 < Oy> what's up with https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2050 btw?
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2233
22:50 < Oy> was there sth to fix in the first place? :D
22:50 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2233#issuecomment-544303995
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I'll move this issue: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2328
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> good question, it was magnet's issue
23:00 < Oy> hm, just tested it, works
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
23:01 < Oy> ok. u move it to localization?
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-translation/issues/75
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> huh, he claims there is no slovak in Transifex
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *fantasy language*
23:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that is strange
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> why would slovak not be in Transifex
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @heinrich5991 got a clue by any chance?
23:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no idea
23:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Dune shall I add it?
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it was there at some point
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so we have to recover the file somehow :(
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> maybe if we add it it will spawn it again?
23:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> doubt it
23:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I mean there is no reason slovak shouldn't be in transifex so do add it I guess
23:18 < Oy> maybe slovak and slovenian were equal so transifex deleted one?
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't think slovaks will be happy to hear about that
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I checked, they still support both
23:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Okay, here is what I think happened: when I cleaned up languages that were not translated at a decent %, slovak got removed, and because of a mistake it was replaced by slovenian text
23:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Now, it doesn't really explain why Transifex removed it
23:26 < Oy> the commit he linked put all the translations from the slovenian file also in the slovak one too
23:26 < Oy> authors are correct
23:26 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-translation/blob/5c26696437594b86cfb54abb3f45d6c9739b8ee7/slovenian.json
23:26 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-translation/blob/5c26696437594b86cfb54abb3f45d6c9739b8ee7/slovak.json
23:26 < Dune_> so authors are still slovak
23:27 < Oy> yeah
23:29 < Dune_> so 1) add slovak language to transifex 2) revert commit 3) try to push those changes to transifex somehow
23:29 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-translation/blob/503ac9b16b645b00095dbbbbc32440c46a588a42/slovak.json original slovakian translations
23:29 < Dune_> heinrich already did 1 but it didn't restore the file
23:30 < Dune_> aight thanks
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @heinrich5991 thanks for restoring the language, do you know if https://docs.transifex.com/translation/importing-translations will create a second resource, or add the translations to the first?
