12:37 < BotoX> so teeworlds on greenlight and nothing on irc
12:37 < BotoX> ok
12:39 < BotoX> are there plans of integrating the steam api into teeworlds?
12:39 < BotoX> like, steam_id for players, join a friends game, invite a player to your game
12:54 < BotoX> Has anyone here seen this new series kek http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/
12:54 <@minus> BotoX: i've seen the pilot
12:55 < BotoX> want to watch the first ep 
12:55 <@minus> want it?
12:55 < BotoX> do you plan on watching it
12:56 <@minus> i guess
12:56 < BotoX> bretty gud, let me know what you think about it
13:03 <@matricks> BotoX: heh, again?
13:03 < BotoX> again? :o
13:04  * BotoX is cornfused
13:05 <@matricks> it's been on greenlight before
13:05 < BotoX> oh.
13:05 < BotoX> But wasn't that unofficially
13:05 <@matricks> is this official?
13:05 < BotoX> I guess so
13:06 < BotoX> There are two people in the creator list that have write access to the github
13:06 < BotoX> or does heinrich5991 have access to by now?
13:06 < BotoX> *too
13:07 <@minus> @matricks | is this official? ← yes
13:08 <@minus> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11408
13:08 <@matricks> minus: read it
13:11 < BotoX> https://i.botox.bz/VID_20150605_134936.mp4 make summer stop please
15:17 <@minus> BotoX: still using deadbeef?
15:18 <@minus> -49dB is the lowest volume it can produce, -50dB is silence already :(
15:23 < rand> does sby know the name of the map in this video ? https://youtu.be/4lxU40mBj9k?t=39 (39s)
15:31 < BotoX> turn down your system volume ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
15:32 <@minus> :|
16:28 <@matricks> BotoX: turn down for what?
17:16 < DoNe_> hello, i'm trying to seperate the network stuff from the teeworlds client, now i got a problem that i can't manage to recive packages from the server via the CNetClient.Recv method. https://github.com/timgame/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/client/client.cpp#l2337
17:17 < DoNe_> But I can see that there are packages arriving from the server using tcpdump
17:23 <@matricks> DoNe_: do you call pump on the client?
17:23 <@matricks> oh yeah, you do
17:23 <@matricks> hmm
17:25 <@matricks> DoNe_: don't remember the details of the protocol if the client is the one that needs to send something first or not
17:26 < DoNe_> as i read the code the client connects, sends password&netversion and waits on 2 snapshots
17:26 < DoNe_> then it considers itself as online and sends also snapshots
17:26 <@matricks> the game client sends stuff as well before the snapshots will start to arrive
17:26 <@matricks> like player information and such
17:27 < DoNe_> you mean stuff like name&clan?
17:27 <@matricks> yap
17:28 < DoNe_> 		else if(Msg == NETMSG_CON_READY) { GameClient()->OnConnected(); }
17:28 < DoNe_> thats was causes the client to send name and clan and skin color etc
17:29 < DoNe_> so maybe the packages i see on tcpdump are only packages that indicate that the server is still alive but no really messages?
17:30 <@matricks> yes, there will be heartbeat messages
17:35 <@minus> matricks: how much sense does splitting the communication into udp and tcp (for respective messages) make?
18:29 <@matricks> minus: not at all
18:29 <@matricks> minus: then you have two different connections to maintain instead of one
18:56 <@minus> well, it's easier than implementing a reliable protocol, matricks
18:58 < heinrich5991> what happens if one of the connections doesn't work?
18:59 <@minus> if udp doesn't work, fallback to tcp, the other way around you're fucked
20:31 <@matricks> minus: teeworlds already have it :/
20:32 <@minus> not talking about teeworlds tho
20:37 <@matricks> ahh, okey
20:42 < heinrich5991> minus: whatcha talking about?
20:42 <@minus> someone's making a game
21:35 < heinrich5991> Edible: noneofyournickswo?
21:35 < heinrich5991> ahh, ...work probably
21:36 < Edible> ^^
21:36 < Edible> hexchat bug
21:36 < Edible> that nick should never appear
21:38 < DoNe_> i just can't find my mistake, did any1 recently do something with network?
21:39 < DoNe_> and knows how the communication works
21:39 < Tobii> DoNe_: i've sent you a pm some minutes ago
21:40 < DoNe_> oh wait im blind, seems like tobii helped me
21:40 < DoNe_> and blind again xD
