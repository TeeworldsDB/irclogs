09:48 < ZillyHuhn> lol Digit
11:22 < ZillyHuhn> Yo Oy any way I can get you to merge my change in the old editor? Im sure there will be a legacy editor cult for some time and who knows when the new editor rlses?
11:23 < ZillyHuhn> Also I do not want to mess with the WIP code 
11:47 <@Dune> ZillyHuhn: all the other issues and PRs related to editor1 were also closed
11:48 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2291 https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2469
11:50 < ChillerDragon> Yea sure it makes sense and all. Its also motivating to look into editor2. But after testing editor2 I realized its not only improvements its also changes that have to be relearend.
11:50 <@Dune> relearend?
11:50 < ChillerDragon> Yea
11:50 < ChillerDragon> its a different editor you have to learn how it works again
11:50 <@Dune> got an alternative word?
11:50 < ChillerDragon> isnt that a word? :D
11:51 <@Dune> ah, relearned
11:52 <@Dune> well yes, it's a complete rewrite. 0.7 rewrote some things too, but you don't see PRs for 0.6
11:52 <@Dune> the sooner you get into it, the more you benefit :)
11:52 < ChillerDragon> was about to mention 0.6
11:52 < ChillerDragon> that didnt work out too well
11:52 < ChillerDragon> and there were even less changes than in the editor
11:52 < ChillerDragon> and yes there was 0.6.5 after the development of 0.7 started
11:52 < ChillerDragon> also 0.6.4?
11:53 < ChillerDragon> 0.6.3?
11:53 <@Dune> because of security patches
11:53 <@Dune> no features
11:53 <@Dune> I'm more comfortable with the old code too 
11:55 < ChillerDragon> I think yes it makes sense to not maintain two editors but stopping updates on the current editor because eventually some new editor will come isnt to productive imo.
11:56 < ChillerDragon> We do not know if a new editor will ever finish or if it will be used by users and if that happens how long it will take.
12:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I agree actually. We could still update the current editor while adding these new features as issues for the new one, which would then be implemented when it catches up.
12:10 <@Dune> > while adding these new features as issues for the new oneThe issue is when you add features for the editorv1 
12:11 <@Dune> without adding them to v2
12:11 <@Dune> it just increases the porting burden
12:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> not necessarily, the core features stay the same
12:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it does in the long run
12:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Q: Does anyone remember how the tee colors changed since 0.6?
12:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> If I send the exact color from 0.6 it's too dark, if I unclamp lighting before sending it, it's too bright
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> And I agree with still allowing patches for editor1, editor2 is a decent while away
12:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> meh
12:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> didn't we go from rgb to hsl?
12:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> packed tee colors were always hsl, 3 bytes
12:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> it used to be that the entire L space was mapped onto the upper half of the L space though
12:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> we also have white base skin parts now
13:02 < Oy> the whole tee redering changed
13:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Oy: Are colors artificially lightened in some way?
13:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Or is it just HSL packed into 3 bytes now?
13:07 < Oy> Learath2: didn't write that new rendering, but i think it's still packed the same way
13:07 < Oy> but there're more layers for a body now and colours are allied differently now
13:16 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/0.6/src/game/client/components/skins.cpp#L157 0.6
13:16 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/components/skins.cpp#L409 0.7
13:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> aha the darkest color is much darker in 0.7
13:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> that's why I've been getting way too dark with old clamping and way too light with new
13:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> .s/with new/without clamping/
13:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Thanks Oy
