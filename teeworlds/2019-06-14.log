00:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yea
00:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But it looks into a folder to get data that is not created on my mac â€¢.â€¢
00:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yea didnt Look into it too long tho
00:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But the Windows 64 bit Build is a pain
00:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Slayer *gV* if you got more questions about cmake, I can probablyâ„¢ answer them
08:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> @heinrich5991 I actually do, but am so busy writing my masterthesis. The Teeworlds docs lack some information how to compile everything with cmake. I would like to try it out.
08:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> https://teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything_linux
08:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> The docs should imo also cover how to fix cmake when adding source files to the project.
09:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> The docs were not updated since. If you would like to do it, there is a github for that @Slayer *gV*
10:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Hmm im not sure if these new chat commands are nice. Imo it is very confusing especially on a modded server that also accepts commands. I tried /team in a ddrace mod and expected to join a team but i was using the teamchat .-.
10:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I mean who types /team instead of pressing a teamchat bind.
10:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
10:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> It just adds more confusion. Opening a seperate console where you know its for client commands is very nice imo. It also has autocompletion and information to the commands. I don't really see the benefit of handling chat commands client side. Also I don't know any game that supports clientside chat commands. I mean you expect the chat to be sent to the server right?
10:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> That should be discussed, yes. Some games do that, all blizzard games afaik
10:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Chat commands are supposed to help addressing the issue of selecting the person you want to whisper when there are 64 players
10:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Also it lets you mute and befriend people with keyboard only
10:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> You can send /team using Escape in the chat.
10:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> @Dune I would gladly like to help. But due to my lacking knowledge about cmake I wouldn't add anything helpful. ðŸ˜›
10:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> @ChillerDragon Chat commands work for many other games, too. I don't see any problem here. But there is no doubt that mods have to adapt to the new situation.
10:58 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> E. g. you could use "/mymod chat-command" over "/chat-command". Or "//chat-command". etc.
11:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye sure mods can adapt but imo it is adding conufusion and not a better ux
11:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not only for the mod support. It just feels wrong even in vanilla to use chat commands for client stuff.
11:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> It was engineered to not restrict any chat message (with Esc), if you have any suggestion to make it more accessible, I'm all ears
11:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> We can also remove it altogether, but then we need another solution for whisper target selection
13:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes i assumed it was built for whisper. I dont get the Esc part tho.
13:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> If you type /r and press escape you leave the command mode and can send "/r" in the chat
13:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Same with /team
14:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so you wanted to keep the ability to send those in chat hmm
14:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i wonder why tho. If you want to communicate something you can prefix it with a space. And if the server would process the whisper command mods could even overwrite that serverside to use their own /team and /whisper commands
14:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so remove all commands from client completly and only keep whisper in server. problem solved.
14:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Overwriting vanilla commands should never be possible. That would add ALOT confusion.
14:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> true
14:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But is it possible right now that the server handles the whisper how he wants? I guess so.
14:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Or we move the wisper target out of chat to an ui like in spectator. You press the wispeher bind and select a tee to wisper to. If you press it defualt selects the last conversation so you only have to press enter or select a new tee.
15:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> how would you select it? if you make an UI to select it with a keyboard, chances are you will end up with something similar to the chat commands, which you can already consider as an UI
15:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> do you know the spectator select thingy?
15:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i forgot how its called
15:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> well that's with the mouse
15:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
15:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> we can add empty names agian if we dont have to type it hehe (just jokin empty names are evil .-.)
15:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think keyboard selection is important for something like chat where your hands are on the keyboard
15:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> imagine you had to use your mouse to ping someone or to select the chat mode
15:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i would also suggest improving this menu to allow for keyboard selection
15:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> the spectator menu?
15:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes would be nice
15:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> additional
15:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can already go to previous/next spectator with a bind
15:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not replacing
15:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it combines well
15:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> you type d. And then you spectate Dada. You press next and then you spectate Dune.
15:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> well you could implement /spec
15:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> that would trigger in spec only
15:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what? no please not more chat commands but less.
15:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> then I don't quite understand what kind of feature you want for spectators
15:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> there are already binds
15:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> if you make an UI that lets you type and autocomplete a name you're basically going to rewrite chat features and have a similar functionality
16:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes haha but not in chat.. i was thinking of filebrowser controls. But im not sure how it should look exactly but this chat doesn't feel good.
