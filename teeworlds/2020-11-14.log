12:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> early 0.7 there were seemingly clients or people could reproduce that. have seen that about one year ago.
13:28 < ChillerDragon> you can also get collision with the floor and get the grounded animation and reduce speed but not refill double jump
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> It hit me tonigt: if you are in a 1 height gap you can't double jump but can ground jump
15:15 < ChillerDragon> watch the velspeed slow down but i dont get the double jump https://zillyhuhn.com/OpenTube/video.php?t=teeworlds_edge_no_dj.mp4
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> but the animation still switches to indicate the jump, and additionally: some games let you ground jump when it's already too late in order to not punish the player to hard
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @ChillerDragon the tee hitbox is round and you probably were a bit to far right
15:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the feed didn't switch to the grounded animation, too
15:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *feet
15:17 < ChillerDragon> yea not in this case but i remember it idk was a while ago
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> there is a map where you can pull it of quite often, image it as hitting the edge with the 'side hitbox'
17:29 <@Dune> o/
17:31 < Oy> o/
17:40 <@Dune> is the time info box  the timelimit info, or the clock?
17:41 <@Dune> if it's the clock, I guess it's changing fast enough that you'd realize it's a clock?
21:56 < Oy> it's the clock
21:57 < Oy> but it shows just hours and minutes
21:57 < Oy> so a clock icon or utf8 char might be good
