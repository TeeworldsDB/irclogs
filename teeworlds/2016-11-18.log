02:01 <@heinrich5991> valla_: could you unpack 0.6.3, check whether it works in the unpacked state, and if so, copy the 0.6.4 binaries in there and check whether that works?
18:41 < rachel> Hi there #teeworlds 
18:42 < rachel> I recently started experiencing a very strange issue
18:42 < rachel> All of the weapons, other players, and flags will blink repeatedly as if they're constantly being redrawn
18:42 < rachel> It randomly started happening, not sure why
18:43 < rachel> I even tried uninstalling / installing a new version of teeworlds / resetting to default settings, but it still happens no matter what
18:44 < rachel> The backgrounds, my character, and any bullets fired (by anyone) appear normally
18:44 < rachel> But everything else is constantly being deleted and redrawn
18:44 < rachel> The rate at which it redraws seems to change randomly as well
18:44 < rachel> Some times it's a slow blink, other times it's a very fast blink
18:45 < rachel> Anyone know what's up with that?
18:58 < rachel> oh yeah health and armor blink too
