19:23 < ***> Buffer Playback...
19:23 < Oy> [15:48:13] https://ibb.co/0FNyBCG
19:23 < Oy> [15:48:24] the time in the score hud is probably too big
19:23 < Oy> [15:49:00] what's the time in the scoreboard topright corner? overall record? probably need some label?
19:23 < bridge_> [15:50:24] [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Well i think a label would just eat space and as far as i know nobody ever was very confused about it in ddnet client where it looks the same
19:23 < bridge_> [15:50:42] [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> imo its pretty intuitive to show the top score there.
19:23 < redix> [15:52:08] Yes. Overall map record
19:23 < Dune> [16:16:06] I'm not familiar with the ddnet client but it seemed intuitive to me
19:23 < Dune> [16:16:16] A label would be difficult to squeeze there
19:23 < Oy> [16:18:20] talked with redix ingame: a small label "record" on top of the time and moving the time down a bit could work
19:23 < Oy> [16:18:54] label can be small. just so that 1st time users see what that number is about, the average one probably doesn't need it
19:23 < Dune> [16:24:11] Makes sense
19:23 < Dune> [16:24:19] I was about to say we already have a record icon, but that's different semantics :D
19:23 < Dune> [16:25:09] Do we really need @Sonix to edit the flag icon or can't it get loaded with different parameters that make it look less... ruggy?
19:23 < Dune> [16:26:02] `image_browseicons = Image("browseicons", "ui/icons/browse.png", 1)` <- I think that 1 flag does something about that
19:23 < Oy> [16:26:11] it's too detailed
19:23 < Oy> [16:26:26] should be simpler
19:23 < Dune> [16:41:59] oh, Zatline's PR :)
19:23 < Dune> [16:43:02] aaaand cmake broke
19:23 < Oy> [16:43:38] crappy cmake
19:23 < Dune> [16:48:02] I prefer to go with https://stackoverflow.com/a/21561889/3660320
19:23 < Dune> [16:49:02] but that goes against cmake recommendations :p
19:23 < Oy> [16:49:34] :D
19:23 < Dune> [16:53:53] not sure about renaming bear to koala though, it breaks compatibility
19:23 < bridge_> [16:54:28] [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i fixed cmake @Zatline  https://github.com/Zatline/teeworlds/pull/3
19:23 < Dune> [16:55:39] i think oy can also edit the PR directly btw, it's a github feature
19:23 < Dune> [16:56:21] negativ.png this should probably be renamed to negative.png
19:23 < bridge_> [16:58:31] [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @Zatline :') nice work
19:23 < Oy> [16:58:44] yeah 
19:23 < Oy> [16:59:14] Dune: that renaming is just for the skin, should be ok then, the parts are still the same
19:23 < bridge_> [16:59:34] [teeworlds] <jxsl13> agree with dune on the gobble part, it kinda helps with the warnings, but it doesn't help when it cannot be turned off for specific files.
19:23 < Dune> [17:00:37] Oy: oh, true :)
19:23 < Oy> [17:02:42] redix: does the precision really need to be part of the snapshots? can't the server just always send 3 digits and make that visual precision be a client feature instead?
19:23 < Dune> [17:03:17] so https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/4f7a52184a850a0397f12feea43d5d23a93d80a0 no longer forces you to get a bear skin :(
19:23 < Dune> [17:03:39] probably the beaver one now :)
19:23 < Oy> [17:03:48] :D
19:23 < bridge_> [17:04:05] [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._. should be default skin with hair
19:23 < redix> [17:06:02] The precision which is needed heavily depends on the mod so I thinks it's better to let the server owner decide. Ddrace would be okay with seconds. Fastcap needs milliseconds =\ the race snapitem usually does not change so it is only sent once anyway
19:23 < bridge_> [17:11:48] [teeworlds] <jxsl13> how about releasing a beta version for people to test before releasing it on tw.com?
19:23 < Dune> [17:12:25] assa's actions build could achieve just that :p
19:23 < bridge_> [17:15:05] [teeworlds] <jxsl13> github action is rather nice
19:23 < bridge_> [17:15:23] [teeworlds] <jxsl13> using it as well ðŸ™‚
19:23 < bridge_> [17:16:01] [teeworlds] <redix> the macos build is still broken i think (due to sdl)
19:23 < bridge_> [17:16:39] [teeworlds] <redix> and bam does not work on windows... but it does not work on appveyor either
19:23 < Oy> [17:17:24] alright

19:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> added timer icon by sonix
19:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> time is right-aligned
19:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> map record has a label
19:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> flag icon for the finishes is still the old one
19:37 < Oy> icon looks good
19:37 < Oy> font size for map record time could be bigger
19:38 < Oy> fontsize for time in score huds could be smaller
19:39 < Dune> text should be centered regardless of icon imo
19:39 < Dune> looks weird
19:40 < Dune> killmessages are no longer blue?
19:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> they are on a new record
19:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah I see

19:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> bigger map record font size, centered timer
19:45 < Dune> what do you think about the centering?

19:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> hud text size 12 and 10
19:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> which one is better?
19:54 < Oy> centered looks better
19:54 < Oy> 10 looks better
19:55 < Oy> could you make the fontsize for the "map record" label smaler?
19:55 < Dune> +1
19:56 < Dune> I'd use HeadlineFontsize
19:56 < Dune> but mb too small
20:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix>

20:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> upper one has 14 for the time, lower one 16
20:15 < Oy> second looks better
20:15 < Dune> yeha
20:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> okay. then i think the last thing is the flag icon ðŸ™‚
20:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> T-3:32h
20:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> x)
21:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/EP7O0/6fe02aa56a.jpg
21:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is there enough space for 100+ hours?
21:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wait or is it minutes?
21:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> if its minutes and i finish in 1h 0secs does it look like i finished in 0 seconds?
21:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, there are long maps, that might take longer than one hour
21:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> yeah, its YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm:s ofc
21:52 < Dune> Oy: I think a new flag will take time
21:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> the hud score should scale with the text length
21:53 < Dune> @ChillerDragon good point, I imagine minutes just go up
22:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Is there any way to parse an teeworlds log file and see how many players are currently online? :/ i thought every "player is ready" message gets followed by a "client dropped" but i ran this script http://149.202.127.134:8080/Pk against my full server that is running since weeks and i got -35 online players xD
22:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> seems like players can drop without being ready o.O
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> timeout?
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ?
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you can use the tw python api instead of parsing :D, but I guess you wanna parse
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i wanna parse ðŸ™‚ what tw python api btw
22:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and what do you mean by "timeout?"
22:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> do timeouted clients drop twice?
22:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> check tw/scripts
22:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh that looks good too
22:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but still
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ready=$(grep -cP '^\[.{19}]\[server\]: player has entered the game. ClientID=' "$logfile")
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> drop=$(grep -cP '^\[.{19}]\[server\]: leave player=' "$logfile")
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm now i get 10000 connected players :/
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> shouldnt it be possible? :/
23:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> T-0:55
23:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @ChillerDragon on disconnect econ status maybe?
23:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm?
23:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> other possible solution
23:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe you have silent spec mode?
23:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> to connect a econ client and then parse status?
23:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> is your goal counting players?
23:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
23:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i try to implement restart when empty
23:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> will end in endless restarts
23:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nah
23:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> only once
23:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> i mean you could get 1000 players
23:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> if you have 1000 dropped
23:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wat? xd
23:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> do you have ready == 10000 or ready-drop == 10000?
23:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> latter
23:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> T-0:30
23:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wat yo countdowning?
23:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> new rls?
23:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol, use the tw api, or the stuff I use in my teeworlds discord bot
23:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> instead of parsing logs
23:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im actually looking into the tw api
23:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's being used there ðŸ˜® to retrieve the full server list every 10 seconds or so
23:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> just will be some extra work to get the port because i can extract the logfile from my settings but not the port
23:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> in order to check in discord, who plays zCatch ðŸ˜„
23:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> oh yeah there is a netmessage for exactly this
23:23 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> you can see the playernum from the browser
23:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/TeeworldsDiscordBot/blob/master/main.py
23:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might as well get your own external ip
23:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> cand check your ports from 8000 - 10000
23:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> localhost:8080
23:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh i can use localhost
23:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you could check your external ip and retrieve the list from the master server and check if there is a subset
23:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._.
23:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or localhost *sadface*
23:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i dont see why i would have to use masterserver
23:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> directly talking to localhost makes more sense to me
23:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> because it could be a bit easier
23:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> typing localhost is pretty easy i was about to lookup how to get own external ip in python
23:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> set(external_ip:8000-10000).cut( set(masterserver_list))
23:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you gotte use some external service for that
23:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe
23:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> hmm, teeworlds with https support
23:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ```
23:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> import urllib.request
23:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 
23:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> external_ip = urllib.request.urlopen('https://ident.me').read().decode('utf8')
23:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ````
