13:25 < Ray_> hi
13:25 <@matricks> HERRO!
14:06 <@minus> wasn't there some teeworlds map site?
14:07 <@matricks> probably
23:08 < day_> .
23:09 < day_> why is teeworlds running on SERVER_TICK_SPEED=50?
23:09 < day_> wouldnt 64 or 128 be more appropriate?
23:15 <@matricks> hmm
23:15 <@matricks> why would 64 or 128 be more appropriate?
23:16 <@matricks> just because it's POT?
23:16 <@matricks> 30,60 or 120 is more appropriate actually
23:16 < EastByte> what's POT ?
23:16 <@matricks> EastByte: power-of-two
23:16 < EastByte> k
23:17 <@matricks> I don't remember actually why I chosen 50... :)
23:17 < eeeee> and snap rate is actually 25
23:17 < eeeee> unless you sv_high_bw
23:19 < day_> matricks: I said that because CS:GO uses it. Maybe not the best reasoning.
23:19 <@matricks> and quake 3 uses 25.. or 30
23:20 < day_> really that low? wow
23:20 <@matricks> game tick rate in teeworlds is 50, but snapshots are only sent at 25hz
23:20 <@matricks> and 2hz on connection 
23:21 <@matricks> I think...
23:22 < day_> i guess that explains why it is pretty much impossible to hit tees at high speed orthogonal to their flight path
23:22 <@matricks> never sat down todo those calculations actually
23:23 < jxsl13> lol
23:23 < jxsl13> why not
23:23 < jxsl13> and what is "high speed" in your opinion?
23:23 < day_> it's just funny if you activate client/server hitdetection display in CS:GO. The difference is hilarious @64tick
23:24 < day_> but if quake3 worked with less, i guess im thinking to much about it :/
23:26 <@matricks> depends on how you do the hitdetection as well
23:26 < day_> I cant really argue with you about this, i know to little about the topic
23:27 <@matricks> okey, teeworlds tickrate is 50, normally, snapshots are sent at 25hz, 5hz on init and 1hz on recover
23:27 <@matricks> init and recover should probably be the same
23:30 <@matricks> projectile checks are done with line trace for the projectile but no sweeping sphere for the tee
23:30 <@matricks> to get it more robust, that should be added as well
23:30 <@matricks> easy todo
23:40 < eeeee> sweeping... sphere? Teeworlds 3D confirmed
