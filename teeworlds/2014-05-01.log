16:56 <@minus> i know
17:56 < Learath2> well i compile teeworlds on mingw 
17:57 < Learath2> but ghost isnt here anymore
18:32 <@minus> Packages (1): firefox-29.0-1
18:33 <@minus> fuck, it affected mine too
18:34 <@minus> wtf it killed my addon bar
18:36 <@minus> phew, everything still in place after the downgrade
19:09 < BotoX> hehe
19:09 < BotoX> told ya
19:10 < BotoX> IgnorePkg   = firefox firefox-i18n-de
19:42 < Iqorxx> Yo guys!
19:43 < Iqorxx> Is anyone online here, or everybody are bots/AFKers?
19:45 < BotoX> Can't you see that I am a bot?
19:45 < BotoX> No, actually I am not. Just ask your question
19:46 < Iqorxx> I have a little idea to made teeworlds better with skins, but...
19:46 < Iqorxx> It is possible to make something like auto skin downloadeR?
19:47 < Iqorxx> Like I have site, ppl are uploading skins and a program will check if there are new ones
19:47 < Iqorxx> And it will automatically install in teeworlds skin folder
19:47 <@minus> sure, that's doable
19:49 < Iqorxx> Aaand, it is possible to make something like simple account system to not have TooMuch skins?
19:50 < Iqorxx> I mean I ahve original skins and my own what I uploaded
19:50 < Iqorxx> everyone can see this skin, and I can see other's custom skins
19:50 < Iqorxx> but I cant use them
19:50 < Iqorxx> using this account
19:50 < Iqorxx> because searching *maybe* 10k+ skins for your is too long :P
20:00 < Iqorxx> gtg, cya
20:02 < Siile> hi guys
20:02 < Siile> what u think about my client?
20:02 < Siile> http://youtu.be/NaWR4udEOhs
20:02 < Nimda3> [YouTube] Title: Teeworlds Client | Rating: 0.00/5.00 | Views: 1
20:09 < BotoX> dat quality video encoding though
20:10 < BotoX> so not smooth lel
20:10 < BotoX> should at least put some blur in there or not use youtube
20:13 < Siile> the quality shouldn't be the point :P
20:13 < BotoX> well, there are no special features I could spot
20:13 < BotoX> The feet seem to be different and that green line
20:14 < Siile> added some bounciness
20:15 < Siile> too bad the quality hides the smooth new recoil and eye movement
20:15 < Siile> also modified the camera to be a bit smoothier
20:16 < BotoX> http://www.allenpike.com/2014/burying-the-url/
20:16 < BotoX> wow.
20:17 < BotoX> what kind of fucking retarded people are developing webbrowser UIs nowadays?
20:17 < BotoX> Is every browsing turning into a toy for children now?
20:30 <@minus> :3
20:30 <@minus> time to get forkin
21:45 < Iqorxx> Yo guys, Im talking from H-Client (TeeWrolds client) ^^
21:46 < Learath2> great ...
21:46 < Iqorxx> D:
21:46 < Learath2> I think i had a patch to ban all Hclient users
21:46 < Learath2> or was it nclient
21:47 < Iqorxx> Why you must ban all Hclient users?
21:47 < Iqorxx> Its bad?
21:47 < Learath2> they were just spamming on my servers using weird features of their clients like going around changing colors
21:47 < Learath2> it was n-client i think
21:47 < Iqorxx> yeah
21:48 < Iqorxx> H-client have just in-game IRC without any weird features
21:48 < Iqorxx> Just IRC and thats all
21:48 < Iqorxx> simple chat
21:49 <@minus> why would you even want irc in a game
21:49 < Iqorxx> Idk, I just download Hclient cuz it looks good
21:50 < Learath2> minus: i dont have two screens i like chatting in irc and playing ddrace at the same time as it isnt really that fast paced
21:51 <@minus> yeah no, that wouldn't work here, my irc client is customized
