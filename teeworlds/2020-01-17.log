00:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> a mac user reported that the github artifacts do not launch
00:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> on teeworlds repo?
01:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yes
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> rand: yes, clamping after every calculation is done would fix this issue properly
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon can you reproduce?
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> btw @ChillerDragon  are you able to apply Robyt3's fix https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1860  ?
15:48 < rand> imho, stronger hook is a side effect of miscalculation, starting from the instant you are the first character, the hook can't get stronger
15:48 < rand> fixing the bug leads to strong hook for everyone
15:49 < rand> (every hook behave like the first character hook)
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, it was obviously not intended by the programmer who wrote the code
16:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Dune i saw ur ping but did not reach a mac yet
17:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Ok, cool
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> doesn't work on macOS 10.14

17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> didn't test the fix yet.

18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the artifacts don't work properly.
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> removing that delegate line doesn't do anything, or it's a problem of my setup

18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> client window doesn't start
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 I think the problem lies with the SDL version
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> No macOS artifacts do not work
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> As far as I was told
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> on macOS 10.14
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> has anyone tried on 10.15?
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> What are you even trying?
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Just the GitHub action artifacts or the Ã¥ fix
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i got access to a 10.15.2 right now what should i test?
19:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune where should the fix even be applied?
19:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> do the artifacts start for you, @ChillerDragon?
19:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
19:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but its a dev machine so it usually starts things better
19:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i mean i have all the libs installed with brew systemwide etc
20:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rqza on catalina 10.15.2 was not able to start GitHub artifacts
20:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> which error message?
20:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i wish i knew
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i wrote a mapgenerator, does anyone have one of my generated maps?
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i need the jungle version <.<
