02:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> They are both alright
02:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> You are talking about things that none would even notice even if they were wrong
07:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> also here:
07:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I'm looking for YOUR downloadedmaps folder to complete my map archive at https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/ (warning, might slow chromium down)
07:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> zip your downloadedmaps folder up and upload it somewhere (e.g. I just found https://anonfiles.com/ which seems to allow up to 20GB, or https://solidfiles.com/ which I suggested before, up to 500MB)
07:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> afterwards PM me the link ðŸ™‚ thanks for your contribution
07:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @LordSk @magnet @MertenNor @teetow sorry for the mass ping. do you guys maybe still have super old maps lying around? ^^
08:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <teetow> Iâ€™ll check, could have some old dev versions of the launch maps
12:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <magnet> What maps are you looking for
13:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It's just an archival project afaik. So any thing really
13:31 < ChillerDragon> @magnet all of them just ur downloadedmaps dir it aims tobe complete
14:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <magnet> That would include my top secret maps
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I don't think I have any sadly, and actually last time I wanted to find my old maps I used your wonderful website ðŸ™‚
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> should all maps in https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-maps have 0.7 compression?
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> this repository is what the maps directory of the official release will contain
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it is downloaded by the script that makes the release
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> so it doesn't actually matter all that much?
14:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> i would slightly favor without 0.7 compression, since then the maps would be backwards compatible
14:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> i want to make a pull request for dm3, but am unsure if it would get accepted if i did it without 0.7 tile compression
14:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't see why the 0.7 release should contain maps without the 0.7 compression algorithm?
14:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> maybe make a 0.6 branch like in the teeworlds repository
14:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if even the official release does not use 0.7 features who will
14:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> 0.7 compression it is then :)
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> (someone else might have a different take on this)
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> note: I'm not just looking for very old downloadedmaps, I need to get new maps as well
14:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I just pinged some people who've been around for a long time and where I didn't see any map entry from them to get old maps that might go missing otherwise
14:57 < ChillerDragon> such a cool project <3
17:45 < Dune> hey Oy
17:46 < Dune> what do you think about joining hacktoberfest? cc @Learath2
17:46 < Dune> > last years, it was opt out, now it's opt in

17:52 < Dune> in a good way?
17:52 < ChillerDragon> no in a bad way
17:52 < ChillerDragon> ppl are rly mad random noobs contribute worst changes that only cost time to decline
17:52 <@heinrich5991> that's the reason for the opt-in they introduced
