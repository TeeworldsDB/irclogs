13:50 < Tie21> Hi, I'm trying to compile Teeworlds on my Linux, and I have some troubles with Freetype 
14:27 <@heinrich5991> Tie21: what is the error message?
15:03 < Tie21> It was with the 6.4.0 version 
15:03 < Tie21>                  from src/engine/client/text.cpp:14:
15:03 < Tie21> other/freetype/include/config/ftoption.h:284:32: error: expected constructor, destructor, or type conversion before « ( » token
15:03 < Tie21>  #define FT_EXPORT(x) __declspec(dllexport) x
15:03 < Tie21> Sorry for the delay, it took me some time to reproduce the error
15:04 < Tie21> there's one weird thing :
15:04 < Tie21> when running bam -c config
15:04 < Tie21> AUTO  freetype             not found (required)
15:05 < Tie21> But the freetype2 package is installed on my distrib, heinrich5991 
15:05 < Tie21> Thank you for your time btw.
16:09 <@heinrich5991> Tie21: install libfreetype6-dev
16:10 <@heinrich5991> and delete config.lua after that
16:12 < Tie21> I'm on Arch linux, and I already installed freetype, do I need a specific version ? 
16:13 <@heinrich5991> delete config.lua and try again
16:14 < Tie21> Still : AUTO  freetype             not found (required)
16:14 < Tie21> And freetype eror
16:15 <@heinrich5991> hm
16:15 <@heinrich5991> where did you get version 0.6.4? I'll try it as well
16:16 < Tie21> Zip on website
16:16 <@heinrich5991> link?
16:16 < Tie21> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/archive/0.6.4-release.tar.gz
16:16 < Tie21> I tried with both gz andzip
16:18 <@minus> Tie21: there's a PKGBUILD, you don't need to build it yourself
16:18 <@minus> and if you're building a mod or so just adjust the PKGBUILD
16:19 < Tie21> minus: ok I will test with that. :) Thanks
16:20 <@heinrich5991> (you can also just use the package from the repository, if you just want to have teeworlds)
16:20 <@heinrich5991> (pacman -S teeworlds)
16:20 < Tie21> Yeah, no I wanted to do some modifications
16:22 < Tie21> It's part of a project for my Internship. I'm working with Trusted Execution Environment (aka TEEs) and use you software as example would have made a really good joke.
16:22 <@minus> and for the pun?
16:22 <@minus> because that's a good pun
16:23 < Tie21> Yep. ^^
16:23 <@minus> are you referring to SGX?
16:23 < Tie21> minus: yup exactly SGX/SEV...
16:23 <@minus> SGX is a bad meme
16:23 < Tie21> ?! 
16:24 <@minus> oh, SEV is the AMD version of SGX
16:25 < Tie21> Yeah... Approximatively equivalent, but working on complete Virtual Machine instead of processes
16:27 <@heinrich5991> yea okay, the PKGBUILD doesn't work anymore
16:27 < Tie21> Arf. :/
16:27 <@heinrich5991> the problem is that `freetype-config` doesn't exist anymore
16:27 <@heinrich5991> which is called by src/other/freetype.lua
16:28 < Tie21> Okay that explains why I get some Windows error, like If I was trying to cross compile
16:29 <@heinrich5991> ah, I fixed
16:29 <@heinrich5991> it
16:31 <@heinrich5991> Tie21: https://gist.github.com/heinrich5991/957428ef68ced0fb8efbb57adb6f8630
16:32 < Tie21> Ok, thank you! :)
