09:48 < Dune> heinrich5991 @heinrich5991 
09:49 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> I'm on holidays with really weak internet
09:49 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> I'll see whether I can find a reliable internet hotspot today
09:49 < Dune> can you give steam instructions somehow? :<
09:49 < Dune> :/
09:49 < Dune> everything else is ready
09:50 < Dune> would simply sending the binaries over turn bad?
09:51 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> you need to install the annoying steam framework to upload that stuff, check out the current folder format and try to integrate with that
09:51 < Dune> okay, thanks :|
09:51 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> perhaps try releasing w/o steam for now?
09:51 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> I'll only be back on monday
09:52 < Dune> I understand, but that's unfortunately too late :/
09:52 < Dune> so I'll try to figure it out
09:52 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> yep
09:52 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> where can I find the binaries if I find internet today?
09:52 < Dune> githubn
09:53 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> k, ty
09:53 < Dune> thanks and enjoy holidays :D
09:53 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> ty

09:55 < Dune> huh
09:55 < Dune> heinrich5991, :(
09:56 < Dune> you are the signee for https://partner.steamgames.com/newpartner/signlatestsda
10:22 < Dune> morning
10:36 < Oy> hey :)
10:44 < Dune> so we got a banner thanks to @android272
10:44 < Dune> just need to figure out how the steam frameworks works now
10:46 < Dune> (unless heinrich finds civilization and internet today)
10:48 < Dune> amazingly enough steam documentations is written under the form of youtube tutorials
11:00 < Oy> :D
12:45 < Oy> do we need some changelog?
13:16 < Dune> yeah, but it's not a big deal
13:16 < Dune> I think we need Steam though?
13:16 < Dune> just arrived home
13:17 < Dune> their packaging tools are messy
13:31 < Oy> no clue about steam
13:32 < Dune> :/
13:33 < Dune> I'll try for the next 30 min
14:16 < Dune> successfully uploaded windows
14:16 < Dune> I don't know how I will handle mac though
14:17 < Dune> since I don't have a folder but a .dmg
14:34 < Dune> ChillerDragon, or someone on mac, can you please tell me what your steam teeworlds folder looks like?
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @MertenNor
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <MertenNor> I am not home right now
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <MertenNor> But I’ll have a look when I am back home if you haven’t gotten a answer yet
14:47 < Dune> ah, that's okay, thanks
14:51 < Dune> steam ready, modulo testing
15:21 < day> i could swear that 62.210.36.177:8303 is using bots to boost his server
15:22 < day> it's this stupid 100cap limit ctf5 server
15:22 < Dune> report with evidence => ban
15:22 < day> impossible to prove
15:22 < day> the server always ends up being populated
15:23 < day> just played a game there against a beyond bad player, he didnt ragequit didnt answer to my requests etc. but instantly left when the 2nd person joined
15:24 < day> could just be a coincidence, but it's just odd that it is always this server that ends up getting players even though noone enjoys the 100 cap limit
15:25 < Dune> if it's a bot you may be able to reproduce the behavior by joining with another client / see him leave instantly, reproduce that
15:26 < Dune> finishing the changelog
15:26 < day> yeah i will keep an eye out, but you rarely will be the first to join etc.
15:27 < day> it wouldnt even really be an issue if only he would raise the stupid 100 point limit to something reasonable
15:43  * Dune wonder's how to filter Oy's commits in git
15:44 < Dune> welp github is nice https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commits?author=oy
16:00 < Dune> Oy, everything looks ready
16:10 < Dune> huh I just crashed on that server, day D:
16:11 < Dune> double free, huh
16:12 < Oy> Dune: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12806 nothing is marked green :P
16:12 < Dune> ouch
16:12 < Dune> thanks
16:14 < Dune> fixed
16:16 < Oy> looks good to me :)
16:16 < Oy> fire at will :)
16:17 < Dune> aye o/
16:18 < Dune> github release first
16:19 < Oy> done
16:20 < Dune> tar.gz link broken
16:20 < Dune> fixed, it's .tar now
16:22 < Dune> moved threads
16:23 < Dune> onto steam
16:23 < Dune> version server needs a touch too
16:24 < Oy> minus: could you update the version server?
16:25 < Dune> steam is live
16:26 < Dune> oh, need steam announcement as well
16:37 < Dune> steam and discord announcements done
16:38 < Oy> good job :)
16:40 < Dune> can't wait to see everyone forced to the bear skin again :D
16:42 < Oy> :D
16:42 < bridge> [freenode] <Texas_C> Excuse me... em... Do you maintain teeworlds on steam? (sry missed too many messages)....  >.<
16:44 < Dune> Texas_C: we do
16:44 < bridge> [freenode] <Texas_C> Cool!! xD
16:53 < Dune> strangely enough, @Fudgy can start from console but not by a double-click
16:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> same for my friend
16:54 < Oy> on steam?
16:54 < Dune> teeworlds.com I think
16:56 < Oy> which os?
16:56 < Oy> btw the big download button beneath the trailer still shows 0.7.2 ;)
16:58 < Dune> win64
16:58 < Dune> right, minus
17:01 < Oy> oh that's odd, is there some kinda error message?
17:02 < Oy> Fudgy win10?
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> a console opens but it closes nearlr instantly, Im on windows 7
17:02 < Oy> ok
17:06 < Dune> how comes a console even opens
17:06 < Dune> it should be release mode
17:06 < Oy> Fudgy could you create you set "logfile log". then try and see what the logfile shows?
17:07 < Oy> well you see it for a part of a second till it gets destroyed probably
17:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I dont get it, what do you mean set "logfile log"
17:07 < Oy> in tw ingame console
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> but the client needs to be opened for that
17:08 < Dune> or set it in the shortcut or settings.cfg
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> ah ok I'll try with setting.cfg
17:08 < Oy> or create an autoexec.cfg within the folder
17:08 < Oy> and put it in there
17:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I tried to look at the error and its something like ERROR cant register ... null process given
17:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> or something, but I'll try what youre saying
17:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> ok the log doesnt have time to work it seems, it works on my working client but not when I try with the one that doesnt start
17:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> But the error it says just before closing is : ERROR : couldn't register interface storage. null pointer given
17:15 < Oy> odd
17:16 < Oy> is there a line "storage", "unable to create save directory"?
17:17 < Dune> I forgot what that error is about
17:17 < Dune> isn't it something to see with local/absolute paths?
17:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> yes I get that error Oy
17:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> that line
17:19 < Oy> hm
17:21 < Oy> Fudgy do you get any "added path" messages?
17:22 < Dune> pastebin the log maybe, @Fudgy?
17:22 < Oy> doesn't get any :(
17:23 < Dune> the console log then?
17:23 < Oy> probably just take a small look at the closing console window?
17:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> my friend managed to screenshot it
17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> http://puu.sh/DhpJ3/1e854001b5.jpg
17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> bad quality but you see enough probably
17:24 < Dune> rand's bots look even less human now :D
17:24 < Dune> your friend is on steam?
17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> no
17:25 < Dune> huh, strange that there are steam paths
17:25 < Dune> i might have fucked up by including storage.cfg in the steam release
17:25 < Dune> it wasn't there before
17:29 < Dune> @fudgy try to delete your steam folder?
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I dont think I have a steam folder
17:31 < Oy> it's probably the new fs_makedir_recursive
17:31 < Dune> your friend has 0.7.2 steam paths?
17:32 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/e117ee0ef1c329f3559fcfb64bd9b33e6adb82d2
17:32 < Dune> or is that just an unfortunate location for extracting the zip archive?
17:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> All I know is that me and my friend are on win7 and 64 bit does that error but 32 bit works fine
17:33 < Dune> maybe I should add that warning on the teeworlds.com download page
17:33 < Dune> steam is 32bit only
17:33 < Oy> ok
17:34 < Oy> do you have different paths shown there with the 32bit version?
17:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> wait Im trying to see them
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> yeah they are the same
17:43 < Oy> Fudgz could zou trz https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/releases/download/0.7.3/teeworlds-0.7.3-win64_new.zip
17:43 < Oy> Fudgy
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Sure
17:44 < minus> i don't want to work :(
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> It opened
17:45 < Oy> works like it should?
17:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Well I joined a server with it and it seems to work
17:45 < Oy> good :)
17:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> anything I should test in particular? xd
17:45 < minus> someone automate updating that versionsrv thing
17:47 < Oy> Fudgy nah it's alright :)
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Also are you aware of a crash when joining a server? My friend crashed 4 times before being able to join his own server :/
17:47 < Oy> minus: yeah, some automation would be nice :)
17:48 < Oy> no, never had one
17:48 < Dune> minus, news.php could also use an update :c
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @Fudgy on 0.7.3 or is it older?
17:49 < Dune> even though i thought i was +w on news.php
17:49 < Oy> Dune: the win64 on github works now, dunno if you have to update on tw website
17:49 < Dune> tw links github
17:50 < Oy> ok
17:50 < Oy> then that's solved
17:50 < Dune> release updated?
17:50 < Dune> nice
17:50 < Oy> yeah
17:50 < Oy> dunno if the win32 needs to be updated too
17:50 < Dune> someone said it was the same on windows
17:51 < Dune> 32bit*
17:51 < minus> Dune: 0.7.3?
17:51 < Oy> ok, will update win32 too
17:51 < Dune> yes minus 
17:51 < minus> are the files on downloads.teeworlds.com?
17:51 < minus> otherwise updating news.php would be a bad idea
17:52 < Dune> no they are not
17:52 < Dune> since 0.7.2 links to github, I linked to github again
17:53 < Dune> ah I see, the news page links to download.com
17:54 < Dune> I might be able to upload those myself
17:55 < minus> $ vim mirror_downloads.sh
17:56 < Oy> changing github release
17:56 < Dune> it wasn't changed?
17:57 < Dune> @Thee00 (had the issue on win32) reports this is fixed for him, and that it fixed lag somehow
17:58 < Oy> changed to the new commit
17:58 < Dune> ah, just the tag?
17:59 < Oy> yeah and release
17:59 < Oy> had to delete old and create new
17:59 < Dune> I think the fix was windows only?
17:59 < Dune> no need to rebuild linux
17:59 < Oy> yeah only win
17:59 < Oy> tried to create the folder 'c:' and failed f.e.
18:00 < Oy> updating src dl's
18:03 < Dune> ah i need to update steam right
18:03 < Dune> windows
18:03 < Oy> yeah
18:03 < Oy> github is done
18:05 < Thee00> Hey
18:05 < Oy> hey
18:11 < Dune> steam update
18:11 < Dune> d
18:18 < Dune> need to upload to downloads.teeworlds.com
18:20 < Dune> scp: /var/www/teeworlds.com/downloads/teeworlds-0.7.2-linux_x86.tar.gz: Permission denied
18:20 < Dune> welp
18:20 < minus> files mirrored
18:20 < minus> 25 minutes to write a shell script :o
18:20 < Dune> https://xkcd.com/1205/
18:20 < minus> granted, i wrote it as posix shell script, not bash thus had no arrays
18:21 < Dune> that's right in the fair margin
18:21 < Dune> 5minutes shaved off for a yearly task :D
18:21 < minus> https://downloads.teeworlds.com/mirror_downloads.sh
18:23 < minus> news.php updated too
18:24 < minus> versionsrv updated too
18:29 < Dune> thanlks
18:36 < Oy> good :)
18:44 < Oy> Fudgy did ur friend crash with the win32 version?
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I dont think so
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> It would crash only on his server though
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> 100% of the time when he would use the join friend button
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> and sometimes when he joined normally
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Ask @WaRNe0nx3 for more details. Im busy for the next hour or so
19:04 < Dune> I had a double free crash
19:04 < Dune> couldn't get backtrace strangely :<
19:32 < Oy> also on joining a server?
19:40 < Dune> yes
19:41 < Dune> could the double free be the statboard? I don't think it does mallocs
19:43 < Dune> it was in mem_alloc_debug or so
19:43 < Dune> I saved the backtrace but idk where cdbg saves those :/
19:43 < Dune> @LordSk might know
19:45 < Dune> I have a report.wer file that should contain info
19:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> nope dunno
19:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> can you reproduce the crash Dune?
19:46 < Dune> looks too  light to have the trace
19:46 < Dune> it's difficult, @LordSk
19:46 < Dune> i could reproduce it on several servers but after some time it's gone
19:46 < Dune> including a CTF server and a botctf server
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> when does it happen?
19:47 < Dune> on server join
19:47 < Dune> double free
19:47 < Dune> cdbg didn't show much for some reason?
19:47 < Dune> I don't know what the caller was
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it's not perfect
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> try by joining a server using the "join" next to an online friend, for us it would crash everytime. (on his LAN race server)
19:49 < Dune> not for me
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I'm asking him to start his server so you can test on it
19:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Ok try on the | Flyrate | map test server
19:53 < Dune> it's fine for me
19:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> you didnt even join
19:53 < Dune> i did
19:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> ok well
19:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I crashed when you joined
19:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> and now I cant join the server
19:53 < Dune> yeah :<
19:53 < Dune> hmm
19:53 < Dune> it's something to see with the settings
19:53 < Dune> can you send me your settings.cfg maybe?
19:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> ye now it crashes everytime
19:54 < Dune> or a stripped version of it
19:56 < Dune> huh it only crashes when i disconnect
20:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> well it can crash in alot of different scenarios as you can see
20:04 < Dune> @LordSk got a trace, but cdbg doesn't go far :/ any better tools?
20:21 < Dune> okay, found the source
21:37 < day> Fudgy: i had that crash on join bug as well, but couldnt reproduce it
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Its not consistent, apparently its because of the easter event
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Dune should be fixing it I guess, since he seems to have found the problem
21:43 < Dune> we're freeing all non-zero pointers 
21:44 < Dune> and apparently some pointers are not zero-initalizee
21:44 < Dune> not sure how that happens
