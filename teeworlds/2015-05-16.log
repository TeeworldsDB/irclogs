17:17 < Abhi> hi
17:17 < Edible> HELLO
17:17 < Abhi> i was just wondering how i can participate in a tournament?
17:19  * Abhi slaps Abhi around a bit with a large fishbot
17:21 < Abhi> ?
17:25 < Edible> much patience
17:25 < Edible> such wow
17:26 < Learath2> he waited a staggering 5 minutes
18:19 < Edible> i waited 6 hours to talk to my doctor
18:19 < Edible> in the office
18:20 < Edible> but thats in the physical world, IRC should be instantaneous
18:21 < Edible> and it is, for me. because i refuse to have look at timestamps
18:21 < LittleWhite> You should have rage quit :D
18:23 < Learath2> you should learn to call the doctor before you go
20:08 < Siile> anyone up for PvE test round?
20:08 < Siile> Server name: Killing Floor
21:27 < Edible> Learath2, i did. but whenever i was gonna get called, i got the shits and well yeah.
23:07 <@minus> oh, there's a new unreal tournament coming, you can even help writing it, it's on github but requires signup (for whatever reason)
23:10 <@matricks> minus: because it uses UE4
23:11 <@matricks> minus: http://i.imgur.com/AoC8JzC.jpg
23:12 <@minus> :|
23:12 <@minus> i guess i'll sign up and take a look
23:13 <@minus> matricks: that's a paraglider
23:14 <@matricks> minus: that's me
23:21 < LittleWhite> you, taking the photo ::D
23:22 <@matricks> no, a friend took it :)
23:54 < Stitch626> i wanna paragliding too in the future maybe
23:56 <@matricks> Stitch626: it's awesome :) you gain 25 awesome points for doing it
23:56 < LittleWhite> :D
23:56 <@matricks> and awesome points are better then grownup points
23:57 <@matricks> but usually you need to gain a certain amount of grownup points before you can paraglide
