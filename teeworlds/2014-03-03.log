14:01 <@matricks> erh... I don't really dare to click that, might just ban you instead
14:01 <@minus> JulianAssange: you're taking too much internets
14:01 <@minus> how about you abstine from /b/ for a week
14:01 < JulianAssange> why is the world so messed up lmfao
14:02 <@matricks> what is that url? what does it show?
14:02 < JulianAssange> it's an ABC News video lol
14:02 < JulianAssange> it's SFW i guess
14:03 < JulianAssange> SFW, but extremely wtf..
14:04 < JulianAssange> matricks: plz /kick me from the world
14:04 <@matricks> JulianAssange: does that affect you in anyway?
14:04 < JulianAssange> not rly
14:05 <@matricks> then have a pint and just chill
14:05 < JulianAssange> i don't drink :(
14:05 < JulianAssange> but homework time 
14:05 <@matricks> then you should :)
14:06 <@matricks> JulianAssange: there is loads of different weird stuff that can happen in biology
14:06 < JulianAssange> i dont care about transtesicle people
14:06 < JulianAssange> but not when you're 11.. ffs
14:06 <@minus> dun need no transgender for boobs
14:07 <@matricks> JulianAssange: it's better to catch it early then later
14:07 < JulianAssange> this is the reason i support the propoganda law in russia about gays
14:07 < JulianAssange> you don't know what you want when you're 11 lol
14:08 <@minus> matricks: where's my pint
14:08 <@matricks> minus: in my fridge
14:08 < JulianAssange> BotoX: you're a gay male, did you know  that you were gay when you were 11?
14:08 < JulianAssange> i would have tagged yemxD but he isn't here :D
14:08 < JulianAssange> but ahh homework bye
14:08 <@minus> pff homework
14:08 <@minus> workwork!
14:09 < JulianAssange> home - work
14:09 < JulianAssange> it's actually class work but yeah lol
14:09 <@matricks> JulianAssange: have you witnessed transgender people up close? they are usually pretty depressed people before they figure it out
14:10 < JulianAssange> bradley manning?
14:10 <@matricks> ..
14:10 < JulianAssange> im serious
14:10  * matricks I have friends that actually are transgender, rough shit
14:10 < JulianAssange> i don't
14:10 < JulianAssange> i don't have friends :(
14:11 <@matricks> having people tell them that they are fucked up etc and shove it under the carpet isn't really helping
14:11 < JulianAssange> ya ofc not, but not when they're 11..
14:12 <@matricks> JulianAssange: you think she decides on her own?
14:12 <@matricks> JulianAssange: there is loads of psychological evaluation before anything happens at all
14:12 <@matricks> and if you catch it early, you can do more about it
14:14 <@matricks> JulianAssange: what should you do about hemefrodite people?
14:15 < JulianAssange> is that even real lol
14:15 <@matricks> ... yeah..
14:15 <@matricks> there is loads of people being born with ambigous gender
14:15 < JulianAssange> >into the trash it goes
14:15 < JulianAssange> but uh.. no idea
14:16 <@matricks> biology isn't binary
14:16 < JulianAssange> that's not a choice/changeable
14:16 < JulianAssange> choice is the wrong word obviously
14:16 <@matricks> and gay is?
14:16 < JulianAssange> but i mean like 
14:16 < JulianAssange> if someone is gay, they can be gay
14:16 <@matricks> there is loads of weird shit that can happen with the X and Y chromozones
14:16 < JulianAssange> if someone thinks they should be a woman, they can turn into a woman
14:16 < JulianAssange> but if someone is both, there's not much you can do
14:17 <@matricks> JulianAssange: well, usually the doctor and parents chooses one for you after some tests to try to determine which one is more dominant
14:18 < JulianAssange> ok, that begs the question.. do you tell the kid?
14:18 <@matricks> usually they don't
14:18 <@matricks> and this might come back to haunt them
14:19  * minus np: Boysetsfire - Walk Astray

15:37 < Madara> Is there an estimated launchdate for 0.7? Just asking if it's useful to work on the old 0.6.2 code...
15:37 <@matricks> when it's done
15:44 < heinrich5991> Madara: yeah, just work on the old code for now
16:19 < Madara> Maybe teeworlds should get a chat protection from such 'things':
16:19 < Madara> [53149d00][chat]:  : Nazi: Sieg Heil \o
16:20 <@matricks> Madara: no
16:20 < Madara> That doesn't have to do with free speach, and there are children on teeworlds-
16:21 <@matricks> so?
16:22 <@matricks> wanna censor penis, schlang and all the other words as well? in all the languages
16:22 <@matricks> ?
16:22 < yemDX> dick
16:22 < yemDX> how can i erp on tw if chat's censored?
16:23 <@matricks> it's really problematic to censor stuff because some people starts to have a hard time to talk, because some offensive words are not offensive in other languages
16:23 <@matricks> and it's dirt simple to avoid automatic censoring stuff
16:23 <@matricks> suckk a dickk
16:24 < yemDX> i used to be pro at that in runescape
16:24 <@matricks> most people can't spell either way so
16:24 <@matricks> I still say we just remove the chat
16:25 < Madara> should start a server which renames nazi to opfer whatever.
16:25 < Madara> opfer=loser
16:25 <@matricks> so stupid
16:25 < yemDX> that's an offensive word too though isn't it
16:25 < Madara> It is.
16:25 < yemDX> ?? whats the point then
16:26 < Madara> Do you tolerate guys who do not tolerate others? That's the same.
16:26 < Madara> imo
16:26 <@matricks> you get offended? so what? BE OFFENDED.. it's not like you gonna wake up with cancer tomorrow because of it
16:26 < yemDX> some people just wanna talk about nazis
16:26  * matricks talks about nazis all day
16:27 < yemDX> sieg heil!
16:27 <@matricks> but I mostly just shoot and kill them
16:27 < yemDX> i prefer zombies and monsters
16:27 < yemDX> but nazis are fine too i suppose
16:27 < Madara> That's the same.
16:27 < Madara> They both are classified as zombies and monsters :)
16:27 < Madara> eeh not both
16:28 < Madara> <- telling sit all day all night
16:28 < yemDX> they're zombies in some games
16:28 < Madara> Those games are used to have a nazi zombie mod.
16:30 < Madara> "that's an offensive word too though isn't it" losers didn't killed so much ppl. except their are nazis
16:30 < Madara> *they're
16:30 < yemDX> i think anyone who kills people is a loser
16:31 < Madara> I actually wanted to say jews instead of ppl, but they r ppl too, and nazis also killed others.
16:31 < Madara> Like homosexuals, a lot of warcrime, usual warkilling [etc]
16:33 < yemDX> does it matter who they kill? lol
16:47 <@matricks> w8
16:49 <@matricks> in regards to being offended: http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=b48_1305790944
16:51 < Madara> It doesn't matter.
18:52 < Savander> Somebody know, how to block fps ?
18:52 < Savander> Without v-syn
18:53 <@matricks> think there is a cl_throttle that you can use to limit the cpu usage
18:54 < BotoX> <JulianAssange> BotoX: you're a gay male, did you know  that you were gay when you were 11?
18:54 < BotoX> w-what
18:54 < Savander> i'll try
18:54 <@matricks> BotoX: ignore him
