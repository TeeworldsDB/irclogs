00:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> then i guess you need to remove the code that calls GL\_QUADS(e.g. create triangles instead of quads, in the ddnet code the code paths that use `g_Config.m_GfxQuadAsTriangle` will help you \: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet) and replace glOrhto with glOrthofddnet also has code paths for `CONF_BACKEND_OPENGL_ES` but it only supports GLES 3 right now

00:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> i guess it would also be easier to use GLES headers instead of `#include "SDL_opengl.h"`
00:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> Might find more potentially bugs
