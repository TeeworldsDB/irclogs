13:30 < Learath2> forced update to ff29 :D
13:33 <@minus> RIP
13:33 <@matricks> grr
13:33 <@matricks> I like rust.. but getting to the point of using it is.. well.. hard
13:36 <@minus> why?
13:37 <@matricks> minus: well, I wanted to try out some graphics stuff
13:37 <@matricks> minus: well, first install rust.. then the rust sdl2 bindings doesn't work because some changes and moving around of functions in the libraries
13:37 <@matricks> so I have to patch the sdl2 bindings first...
13:38 <@matricks> the language is a bit unstable :)
13:43 <@minus> the problem with coding opengl stuff: there's no proper skeleton code you can easily build onto
13:43 <@minus> wanna quickly hack something? need to build a skeleton for hours
13:43 <@minus> picking together stuff from tutorials n stuff
13:57 < heinrich5991> Learath2: use pentadactyl and tree style tab â€“ fixes everything
13:57 < heinrich5991> Learath2: and don't be so afraid about new UI
13:58 <@minus> pentadactyl?
14:01 < heinrich5991> minus: vim in firefox :)
14:01 < heinrich5991> well
14:01 < heinrich5991> vim-style firefox
14:02 <@minus> eh
15:16 < fisted> yeah new UI is always a good thing
15:16 < fisted> the more often the better
15:16 < fisted> anyone in to reworking some UI for the lulz?
15:42 <@minus> my dad just asked me where his bookmarks/the menu disappeared to
15:42 <@minus> gj mozilla
15:58 < Inedible> hey web browsers are against urls and anything local
15:58 < Inedible> just look at the terrible default book managers.
17:04 < BRAUTLES1> Hi! :D
20:52 <@minus> thanks quakenet for reminding me about eurovision
20:52 < edible> woah wait a sec, so bookmarks got taken out from FF then?
20:53 < edible> what is eurovision?
22:27 < heinrich5991> fisted: neither is being forced to stay with the same UI IMO
22:50 < BotoX> anyone here with a server in the netherlands?
22:55 <@minus> got a 10GigE machine there
22:55 <@minus> in my dreams
22:56 < BotoX> c-can I has shell?
23:51 < Learath2> to his dreams ?
23:58 < fisted> heinrich5991: ``forced to stay with the same UI''?
23:58 < fisted> i'm not sure what you mean
