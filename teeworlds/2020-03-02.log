11:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yo, i want to start a project which is basically a serverside control of quads. For example I want to render a specific quad at the Position of the player when he executes a chat command. I can imagine this works, because in 0.6 necropotame made a system for the infclass class chooser. It even highlights a selected quad (selectable by mouse). In the map file itself there are also skin files, which then get built into a skin. I don

11:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> this is his github, where the system is in.
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> abuse game time
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i somehow doubt thats how necro did it
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> animating using game time did not work to well for me and i think it does not show a timer change in infclass
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> correct chiller
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> check out engine/server/mapconverter.cpp
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thats crazy stiff
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thats crazy stuff
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea thats compsing the skins
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> also, @heinrich5991, using gametime i cant place the quad where i want
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is this guy still active?
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> not afaik
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> deen pinged him once on GitHub a few months ago - no reaction
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there were timer changes when selecting the class in infclass
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye?
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> where?
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well im sure the timer things we did in ddnet++ were the worst and it could be done better. But that good?
15:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> timakro once worked on that and he said something about precision limits
15:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and every time value will be hit eventually so you get random artifacts
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what i want to do is place quads from the Server, without the need of animating them in the editor
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well, of course the quad needs to be in the map file, but not animated
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what do you want to do? work with the capabilities of the vanilla teeworlds client?
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think in this case you need to animate quads using gametime
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but that wont work if i want to place quads based on other players positions
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ye. so as far as I can tell, it can't be done (if you're not going to enumerate all the possible positions for players)
15:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> teehistorian, when?
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and how did necropotame did animations based on mouse input @heinrich5991 ?
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you get mouse input on the server
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> then you set the game time
16:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea
16:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but you think he does that?
16:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
17:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> can you show me where
18:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> is infclass open source?
18:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991  https://github.com/necropotame/teeworlds-infclass
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> teehistorian, when?
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 teehistorian for vanilla?
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> or what do you mean
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah :D
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> YEAH >:()
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> !!!!!!!
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> !
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 i sent the link above already...
19:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> tenemos mas teehistorian para crowd sourcing cheater inputs. si ._.
19:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I can't parse that
19:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ;'(
19:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> sad stuff.
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't understand what you said
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the spanish people need Teehistorian
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and I do as well
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (I understood the parse joke)
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does anyone know the behaviour of the cursor position when zooming out?
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> in vanilla
