17:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Patiga if you make other parts writable, i will base another mapgenerator on this
17:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> is there a manual for that tool somewhere?
17:45 < minus> wouldn't it make more sense to make decompressing data an option when opening the file, Patiga? since you usually know ahead of time whether you're gonna need it or not, and if you need it probably prefer it not being loaded on demand
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> those abstractions were too crazy to port it to go :'/. Those enums are crazy shit ._. Teeworlds implementation in Rust, when?
21:21 < rand> look for twlib by heinrich
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> minus you usually only need very specific data. one script of mine for example only needs the game layer, another the images. the idea was that you usually load the specific data you require right after opening the file. you can also just call `load` on the entire map struct to load everything
22:56 < minus> ah, that makes sense. idk how the teeworlds map format looks like at all
