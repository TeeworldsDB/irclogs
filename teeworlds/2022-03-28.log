15:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> Today I learned, that adding tuning values not at the end changes the netcode
15:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> logical
15:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thats the order they are sent
16:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> great, that you have that info
22:34 < labrax> hello all! Dune, since you made the announcement of the recent security vulnerability that led to Teeworlds 0.7.5 being released, I was wondering if you know who the CVE Program participant was for CVE-2020-12066.
22:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> hello labrax
22:39 < labrax> hello Dune :)
22:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's a bit old, I don't remember who reported it to us
22:41 < labrax> ah, I was wondering who you submitted the CVE to - whether it was to MITRE directly, or through one of their many program partners listed on https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners
22:41 < labrax> The reason being that I have discovered a vulnerability in a project I maintain, and was wondering if there was a better choice than contacting MITRE directly for open source projects :)
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> hmmm
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> heinrich5991 might know, but I haven't seen him around lately
22:43 < labrax> I think I last saw heinrich5991 on ChillerDragon's CTF, but that was also a long time ago :)
22:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> he's sometimes active here and on discord ( @heinrich5991 )
22:47 < labrax> OK thanks :) heinrich5991 should have seen this if he's around, so I shant bother him more about it :D Thanks for responding; it's probably not an important vulnerability but I thought it my due diligence to ask around!
22:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> no problem. I don't have a good clue how the process works myself
22:49 < labrax> Looks like just a big form if you do it through MITRE, https://cveform.mitre.org/ and maybe a slightly shorter form through another partner :D
