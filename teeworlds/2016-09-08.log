00:07 < needs1> Do you prefer an URL looking like: "teerank.com/players/pages/1.html?by-rank" or "teerank.com/players/by-rank/pages/1.html"?
00:07 < needs1> Where by-rank can also be by-name or by-clan
01:21 <@heinrich5991> needs1: probably /by-rank/1 or even by-rank/?p=2
01:44 < needs1> heinrich5991: Great suggestion, I like teerank.com/players/by-rank.html?p=2
01:45 <@heinrich5991> you could leave out the .html
01:52 < needs1> Actually, I also have a JSON version of the same page, teerank.com/players/by-rank.json?p=2
01:54 < needs1> Ah, I could still make .html optional
13:57 < user> is there a way to find a src for bam 0.2?
13:58 < user> and yes i know that's like 4-5 years old
14:02 < jxsl13> more like 8 - 10 years old
14:02 < jxsl13> maybe more
14:03 < user> probably.
14:04 < user> trying to compile a teeworlds 0.5.2 source
14:04 <@heinrich5991> user: what are you trying to do? compile 0.5?
14:04 <@heinrich5991> you can compile 0.5-endofline with 0.4.0
14:04 < user> do i just copy a bam.lua into the directory?
14:05 < user> currently i have a config.bam and default.bam
14:05 <@heinrich5991> default.bam is bam 0.2.0
14:06 < user> I mean, for the teeworlds source I'm trying to compile
14:06 < user> If I can compile a 0.5.2 source with 0.4.0, then there's no need for a 0.2 bam source
14:08 <@heinrich5991> ah
14:11 < user> actually, can a newer client open 0.5.2 maps fine?
14:12 <@heinrich5991> yes
14:12 < user> ty
15:06 < Stitch626> i think i have bam 0.2 in my source-database (i also have much 0.5.2 sources) but why u want compile 0.5?
15:06 < Stitch626> ehh didnt noticed he alrdy left..
