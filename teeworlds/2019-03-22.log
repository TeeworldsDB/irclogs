12:19 < TeeSlayer> rand: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2069 didn't fix it btw
12:20 < TeeSlayer> rand: nvm it did, tested wrong binary
12:20 < TeeSlayer> :D
14:32 < rand> the server has to not use whisper for client specific message, at least for now
18:29 <@Dune> hey
18:29 <@Dune> advanced scoreboard (almost) fully functional
18:29 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/ALYHRi9.png
18:29 < minus> fancy
18:29 < Oy> hey
18:29 <@Dune> for some reason flag grabs don't work, clientid info isn't there
18:30 < minus> well, not fancy fancy but fancy and probably not understandable without reading the docs
18:30 <@Dune> it's a bit bloated, yeah
18:30 <@Dune> onmessage(GAMEMSG_CTF_GRAB) doesn't seem to give more info than team
18:30 < Oy> maybe duplicate information could be removed?
18:31 <@Dune> it also has a menu, not sure if that should get into teeworlds: https://i.imgur.com/QQseDA5.png
18:31 <@Dune> what duplicates?
18:31 <@Dune> as far as I can see it's just very detailed
18:32 <@Dune> I guess ratio/net/FPM really is a lot for the same thing. they can be disabled by default I guess? or just scrapped
18:32 < Oy> the grab message probably just does the sound, no clientid needed for it
18:32 <@Dune> Frags should probably be renamed to Kills since we have "K" in the scoreboard
18:32 <@Dune> err, but the sound happens before the flag info is updated I think \|
18:33 <@Dune> when I play I usually only have ratio, spree, best spree and captures on. tastes, tho...
18:34 < Oy> sound is send instantly. the flag info comes with the snap, could check that one to find out who grabbed it
18:35 <@Dune> I guess the simplest option is to remember that a flag grab sound happened and get that info from the next snap
18:35 < Oy> about the scoreboard: yeah, ratio, net, fpm seems to be the same
18:35 < Oy> yeah
18:36 <@Dune> what about the menus?
18:36 <@Dune> ah, I didn't test 64p
18:37 < Oy> menus?
18:37 <@Dune> > Segmentation fault (core dumped)
18:38 <@Dune> welp
18:38 <@Dune> yeah, the second screenshot
18:38 <@Dune> that was in the original
18:38 <@Dune> Not sure if those should be options at all
18:38 < Oy> oh didnt see that
18:39 < Oy> yeah, might be good if you could customize the info you want
18:40 <@Dune> gotta find room though
18:41 <@Dune> the mod uses an extra tab 
18:43 < Oy> hm, would rather not have an extra tab for it
18:44 <@Dune> yeah, it's not nice for locales either
18:44 <@Dune> we can use the nice scrollbars from @LordSk 's API ;)
18:44 <@Dune> not sure how though
18:45 < Oy> :D
18:46 <@Dune> it's a tricky one :/
18:46 <@Dune> speaking of locales, I assume we're not going to add too many?
18:47 <@Dune> could do the call for translations + talk about heinrich5991's improvements to reordering at once
18:52 < Oy> guess a few still might be added
18:52 < Oy> but you could make the call. people usually take time
19:29 <@Dune> gotta export the new strings  to Transifex first and simultaneously announce it over there as well
20:05 < Oy> ok :)
20:33 <@Dune> woo, skin change in 0.7.3 :)
20:35 <@Dune> really need to run that IRC bot again so Oy can't sneaky commit cool stuff like that :P
20:35 <@Dune> are there any security patches in this release, btw? I saw the three recent issues, but I think they were introduced post-0.7.2?
20:43 < Oy> :P
20:43 < Oy> don't think there're any security fixes
20:48 <@Dune> alright
