10:04 < ChillerDragon> Is it possible that there is space for improvement when it comes to bad connection support? I currently have really bad internet and teeworlds became unplayable laggy but i do not notice anyything in cs:go or minecraft for example.
11:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> both cs:go and minecraft trust the client to a certain degree
11:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that allows them to be more playable under lag, but also allows the client to modify actions in the past or skip through walls/fly a little in minecraft
12:15 < ChillerDragon> ah yes makes sense yea I guess its better the way it is in teeworlds so thats fine
