23:35 < Kubi_> Hello :) Can someone help me please in coding Teeworlds? I want to add a chat command but i cant (details will follow if responsed)
23:35 < heinrich5991> respond
23:36 < Kubi_> Something like /upgrade hammer. And the problem is "hammer" i cant read out this part.
23:36 < heinrich5991> you could check the console code
23:37 < Kubi_> Thanks. I forgot the console works also at this princip. 1 moment :)=
23:38 < Kubi_> In which .cpp i have to look?
23:38 < Kubi_> ah gamecontext i think :)
23:41 < Kubi_> Hmmm theres always something like pResult->GetString(1); or (0). For example ConForceVote has (1). What does this mean?
23:42 <@minus> are you using an IDE?
23:42 < Kubi_> sorry what?
23:42 < heinrich5991> well
23:42 <@minus> i'll take that as a no
23:42 < heinrich5991> a development environment
23:44 < Kubi_> hm i knew that as SDE.ehm no i dont. i use notepad ++ to code. if this was nessescary
23:45 < Kubi_> i have Visual Studio 2012 and 2010 :)
23:47 < Kubi_> if someone wants to have a look (and wants to help me haha) i have teamviewer and skype :)
23:48 <@minus> but it's late ._.
23:48 < Kubi_> thats true,  i thought there could be someone haha :D
23:49 < BotoX> I like the chatconsole approach that heinrich5991 did
23:49 < BotoX> used it here for example: https://github.com/BotoX/teeworlds/blob/saved-score-pub/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp
23:49 < heinrich5991> =)
23:49 < heinrich5991> it's the most clean variant IMO :)
23:49 < BotoX> yeah, and easy to add new things
23:51 < BotoX> Why did you add the ReentryGuard in the SendChatResponse() function by the way?
23:51 < BotoX> There shouldn't be any threading or multiprocessing going on :o
23:52 <@minus> better safe than sorry
23:52 < BotoX> still...
23:52 <@minus> ;)
23:52 < MertenNor> hey :)
23:52 < BotoX> sent ;)
23:52 < MertenNor> any of you guys familiar with wine on linux (server) ?
23:52 <@minus> night
23:52 < MertenNor> night minus ;)
23:53 < BotoX> gn8
23:53 <@minus> MertenNor: please, don't
23:53 < BotoX> Yeah MertenNor
23:53 < BotoX> You have to for some shitty games like teraria
23:53 < MertenNor> minus: eh xD but I need a server for this game LOL xDD
23:53 < BotoX> also minus: https://i.botox.bz/1402264411.png
23:53 < BotoX> le dumped :^)
23:53 <@minus> BotoX: what about that?
23:53 < MertenNor> BotoX: it is not teraria it is Supraball ! :D
23:54 < MertenNor> its Awesome ! 
23:54 < MertenNor> :)
23:54 <@minus> BotoX: remember who was on mumble yesterday?
23:54 < BotoX> it's from mangatrader
23:54 < BotoX> yeah, you, right :O
23:54 < BotoX> I guess you have the login credentials to that too?
23:54 <@minus> if mumble has logs
23:54 < BotoX> nope.avi

23:55 < MertenNor> I get this: http://i.imgur.com/0bSvHO1.png  .net 4.0 should be installed now.. but looks like I am missing something  
23:55 < Kubi_> hm botox i've found this: str_comp_nocase. is this the answer for my question
23:55 < BotoX> it compares two strings
23:55 < BotoX> and ignores uppercase/lowercase
23:55 < BotoX> returns 0 if the strings match, >0 otherwise
23:56 < Kubi_> :( im an idiot. will never make this.,.
23:58 < Kubi_> botox do you know Furos?
23:58 < BotoX> um, nope
23:59 < Kubi_> hmm. oke. He is a coder too, thougt you would know him. his in 626 too. nevermind :) can you give me please conrete tips. something like a line to look or so 
23:59 < Kubi_> (for idiots)
