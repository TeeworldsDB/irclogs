01:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe i broke irc now, idk
01:56 < rand> irc is fine
13:49 < kilitr> Hello everyone ! :)
13:49 < Dune> hey kilitr 
13:50 < kilitr> i was wondering, why my teeworlds stutters, when compiling under linux. I use the proprietary nvidia drivers and also the debugging fps graph says, that fps are constant - however, the experience is by far not fluent
13:51 < kilitr> i was compiling the master branch
13:51 < Dune> kilitr, try tweaking vsync and fullscreen
13:52 < Dune> we had some bad experiences on linux mint, not sure why
13:53 < kilitr> i'm on ubuntu 18.04
13:53 < kilitr> will try Dune, thanks
13:53 < kilitr> however, i was hoping to get it working in windowed mode
13:53 < Dune> do you have several monitors?
13:53 < kilitr> yes
13:53 < kilitr> may that be a proble
13:54 < Dune> when I start teeworlds with some other applications that use GPU on windows, it stutters for ~1.5s every 10s
13:54 < Dune> (windowed, with two monitors)
13:54 < kilitr> i didnt watch for a pattern... imma look for that right now
13:55 < Dune> fullscreen may solve the probel
13:55 < kilitr> well the menu works without a problem
13:56 < kilitr> no the "lags" are shorter than 1.5s and appear randomly and more often than every 10s
13:57 < Dune> well the menu doesn't move, how would you figure?
13:58 < Dune> I guess the background does
13:58 < Dune> does fullscreen help?
13:59 < kilitr> yes, fullscreen is alright
13:59 < kilitr> however, the monitor doesnt change when i select a different one in the menu
13:59 < kilitr> it's always the left one
14:15 < Dune> f1 -> gfx_screen 1 ?
14:15 < Dune> (or other numbers)
14:17 < kilitr> this works, thanks
14:17 < kilitr> :D
14:18 < Dune> interesting though, the GUI doesn't?
14:19 < kilitr> no, when i change it in the guiit may work, when the first screen was selected during start... but if i close the game and restart then its the initial screen again
14:19 < kilitr> and also it wont change at all if i click the option then
14:20 < kilitr> kind of confusing and hard to explain i hope you understand what i just said haha
14:20 < Dune> huh
14:21 < kilitr> lets say i have [0] configured and change it to [1] -> works
14:21 < kilitr> now [1] is configured, i restart it shows on screen [0]
14:21 < kilitr> i change the option form [1] to [0] -> nothing happens but if i change it without restarting from [0] to [1] again also nothing happens
14:22 < kilitr> so basically it only works if 0 was configured, i start the game fresh and change it to 1
14:22 < kilitr> in all other cases it doesnt work
14:40 < Dune> kilitr, I understand, weird
14:40 < kilitr> there is already a Todo in SwitchWindowScreen because it is bugged
14:41 < kilitr> as a workaround they tried to toggle fullscreen, change the index of the monitor and toggle fullscreen again
14:41 < Dune> indeed I see the TODO
14:41 < kilitr> but that doesnt seem to work with me haha
14:41 < Dune> the bug only happens in fullscreen?
14:41 < kilitr> well it wouldn make sense to change the monitor via such an option if in windowed mode, i guess
14:42 < Dune> ah right
14:42 < kilitr> or you mean borderless ?
14:42 < Dune> nah stupid question :p
14:42 < Dune> probably borderless works fine yeah
14:42 < kilitr> ill try haha
14:42 < Dune> so you don't see the ToggleFullscreen happening?
14:42 < kilitr> no not at all
14:43 < kilitr> and borderless doesnt work any differently
14:43 < Dune> okay..
14:43 < kilitr> but its more laggy
14:43 < Dune> toggle fullscreen works manually though?
14:43 < kilitr> because there even the menu lags for whatever reason
14:43 < kilitr> im starting to think, the error is in my system
14:44 < Dune> the likelihood of bugs in teeworlds is not low :P
14:45 < kilitr> what imma do is compile ddnet with the same system and see, if i run into the same problems
14:45 < kilitr> if not we may be able to take some code from there
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> trying vanilla 0.6 might help
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> less â‰ 
14:46 < Dune> I think ddnet uses SDL2 as well(?)
14:47 < kilitr> SDL 2.0.8
14:47 < kilitr> yep
14:47 < kilitr> im not really familiar with teeworlds source code at all as im just now starting to look into it :x :D
14:51 < kilitr> well it works in ddnet
14:58 < kilitr> this is weird
14:59 < Dune> yeah, not sure why though ^^
15:00 < kilitr> omg... shame on me - i compiled via CLion and somehow it must have made something different
15:00 < kilitr> i just compiled teeworlds via commandline again and apparently it works
15:00 < Dune> not sure if that's the difference
15:00 < kilitr> sorry
15:01 < kilitr> ls
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i think my debian 10 update killed the mapeditor shortcut. ctrl+shift+e seems to be trapped by my os and does set my cursor to a different application. I guess its a debian update thing. Anyone having similar problems?
22:24 < minus> that's a window manager thing, not a OS thing
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea well i mean my debian update probably updated my wm but ye ur right
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so anyone using gnome here?
23:02 < fstd> bitch, please.
23:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ^this
