00:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you can read my mind
00:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I was intending to write that when it was deleted :0
00:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (Y)
10:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @heinrich5991 if i would get only rights to delete stuff in the support channel i would do it occasionally <.<
11:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Spam is on the whole forum and already dealt with several times a day :/
16:23 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <n000b> Not possible to ban spam with a simple script?
16:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> does anybody know where the gameflags are defined? oO like GAMEFLAG_SURVIVAL

16:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> nice, this sucks
16:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @n000b can't get much simpler than deleting a user in a few clicks
16:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <n000b> Dunno, if it can be automated you dont evenneed to worry about it
16:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can't easily automate spam detection
17:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> emails do ðŸ˜„
17:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and it seems it was some rather easy approach how email spam detection works. just forgot what kinda "AI" approach that was. Just gotta mark some mails as spam.
17:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and they are then detected 99% of the time.
21:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> calling `StartVote("Description", "restart", "Some reason");` doesn't show my any Description Oo
