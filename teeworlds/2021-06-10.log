09:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zwelf> Yeah, it being slow isn't really nice. But most of the times only matrix.org is affected of the slowness (because t2bot.io where the bridge is located bridges a lot of rooms to matrix.org). The bridge is more stable if you use other homeservers like tchncs.de, fachschaften.org or feneas.org.
