12:12 < Learath2> This serverinfo change really needs a NETVERSION_BUMP if you want it to be pretty
17:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> What do you guys think about access to the console in editor? And some mapping api. Like 'set_tile <group> <layer> <x> <y>' then one could write something like a signature or other reusable compnents in configs and then quickly add them to the map. Also some compose scripts to apply automappers and gametiles in the correct order.
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> have you seen LorkSk's WIP editor rewrite?
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think it's on the TODO list
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2486
17:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> looking into that is on MY TODO LIST ðŸ˜„
17:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea there is exactly that awesome
17:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @LordSk you mi hero
17:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hehe
17:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> > What do you guys think about access to the console in editor? And some mapping api.

17:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> That is part of the plan
17:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye just saw it
17:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> great
17:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but own console?
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I guess ye cuz editor has always been so separate from the rest of the client. But when there is a editor console with editor binds that are not accessible from the normal console it could be confusing imo.
17:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> how so?
17:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> You would only use these binds in the editor anyway, right?
17:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea?
17:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what about get meta data like mapper credits and license of map that is currently on the server?
17:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> or other stats.
17:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Also maybe one wants to automate mapping things by passing commands to the binarys as arg like ``./teeworlds "do:map;editor;magic"``
17:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what you're looking for seems to be a python library for mapping ðŸ˜›
17:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ikr
17:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't think a good one exists rn
17:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not for 0.7 i guess
17:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but over tw commands it could be more simple and less pythong
17:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @LordSk so the settings file contains editor binds that can only be executed by editor engine and editor configs that can only be executed by tw command engine?
17:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so there are 3 consoles then yikes
17:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> then yikes.
17:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye extracting that sure has some advantages i just wanted to ask
17:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and mabe point out some concerns
17:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> for sure better than nothing and a big improvement ðŸ™‚
17:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Why would you want to access editor commands in the client console?
17:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *kabooosh*
17:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> like i said to do some things like getting information about maps i currently play quickly via local console
17:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and also using one command pipe everywhere
17:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i fear that the editor command engine will be hidden somehow but i guess it can be made exposable like the remote console is also accesible from the local console
17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Then it looks like a client command to me
17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and has nothing to do with the editor
17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> you mean things like fetching meta data?
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well idk
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> anyways nice that you have plans for the editor!
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> if you need help with tasks that can be done by a dude who failed hello world exercise for university let me know ðŸ˜„
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> will do ðŸ™‚
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> The editor works in the context of actually editing a map, fetching a few informations about the map you're playing on is a different matter
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @LordSk ever thought about using something like dear imgui for the editor ui? I never worked with it myself, but as the editor requires more advanced ui elements than the rest of the client it might be useful :DNot sure how hard it would be to integrate it into the tw rendering and input code though
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I absolutely love dear imgui ðŸ˜„
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> And yeah it could be useful, but since we'll have to actually write the ui code with teeworlds stuff, why not start now?
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> well that's the question... do we need to write the editor ui with tw stuff? Doing the client ui ourselves makes sense because of the look and feel of the elements. But is it required for the editor?
17:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Hm that's interesting point indeed. Do we want a dear imgui dependency ?
17:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Also I am not exactly sure how much work it would be to integrate it in the current source as you pointed at
17:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> is it even worth it
17:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> that would be the next point... they even include another library for loading font files i think =\
17:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> the stb_* stuff?
17:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yeah making it work with the rendering api and input system might be some work
17:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yeah
17:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> For now the ui stuff was not hard nor long to make
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I've kept it simple on purpose of course, but I think it'll be fine
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> okay. was just an idea that came to my mind ðŸ˜„
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Now if it becomes a lot more complex we might want to reconsider
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yep thanks, I'll keep it in ming
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> d*
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> i'm not a big fan of writing ui code in general
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> who is really ðŸ˜„
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> true ^^
17:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> also imgui might require a higher opengl version than we currently support
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> i think you can use it with opengl 2 i think. though it might not be optimal
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> but that would still be higher than the 1.1 which is currently required
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah it seems like gl 2 is possible
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> raw opengl is hardly possible with the threaded rendering anyway =\
18:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> people managed to crash `str_toint`, how and why?
18:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> nevermind, there is a crashbug in teeworlds which people abuse
18:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> gg
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> client, server, also in the latest version? can you debug it?
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> latest version server.
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I will debug it the next days because iam in quarantine
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> okay ðŸ˜®
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Assa server or client crash?
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> server crash
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah
18:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> only gctf servers have this issue
18:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> So it's not a teeworlds bug? Or it's a trunk bug
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I'm up for the editor UI code. I enjoy brainless coding
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you can crash str_toint which is in teeworlds with a unfiltered user input
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> my brain thought you added checks whish prevent crashing, which is not the case
18:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> assa is coronated :( get well
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and don't get sick
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if you are well
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> living on pizza delivering service incoming
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> prob. too late
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> don't infect those poor people
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> prob. too late
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that deliver your food
18:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :'( gloves, sanitizer and a stick to pass money.
18:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> get well :0
18:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the bas thing is I work at a university
18:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *bad
18:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, you stay home and get paid?
18:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, many potential people you might have infected. sad life.
23:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> crash bug in editor: press the `generate` button of the automapper in grass_doodads ~100 times and the client crashes
