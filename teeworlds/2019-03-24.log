00:08 < rand> I can say it was definitly not me
00:09 < rand> not sure about his skills
00:09 < day> he's good
00:09 < day> not mario good though
11:54 <@Dune> Gotta discuss composed binds, UI transparency, and timer stuff 
11:54 <@Dune> The timer stuff is tricky, i don't have a good idea of how it should be 
11:55 <@Dune> The forced 3s warmup had negative feedback and the sv_warmup options are maybe a bit confusing 
11:56 < Oy> it needs some consistency
11:56 <@Dune> I can test hidpi stuff if need be but I think some people had issues I didn't have
11:56 < Oy> should still keep it for survival games
11:56 <@Dune> Oh so different behavior?
11:56 <@Dune> Depending on the gametype?
11:57 < Oy> it's really good for survival
11:57 <@Dune> Isn't that hacky 
11:57 <@Dune> Yeah
11:57 <@Dune> But how do you implement it properly 
11:57 < Oy> if u notice the start one second too late it could already be over
11:57 <@Dune> right
11:58 < Oy> hm not sure
11:58 <@Dune> But it should still be possible to enable it in ctf and disable it in lms
11:58 <@Dune> sv_warmup 0 be default, -1 be never, and >0 be always? 
12:28 < matricks_> Oy: that absolute path thing is a bit.. well... weird :)
12:47 < Oy> matricks_: yeah :)
12:48 < Oy> Dune: yeah that might be a good option
12:55 <@Dune> alright
12:55 <@Dune> gotta retrieve food first :p
15:30 <@Dune> heinrich5991, btw I think I'm done with the IRC bot configuration, but I can't seem to have open ports for the webhook on my machine, so maybe you'd have a way to test that somehow
15:51 < day> im pretty sure that with enough velocity delta it's possible to move through 50% of another tee, the collision detection then accelerates you even further :D
20:50  * the2048 waves
22:00 <@heinrich5991> Dune: what do you mean? you need a server to run this on?
22:16 <@Dune> ideally yeah. I tried to send the github payload via curl to test but it didn't work out
23:52 <@heinrich5991> Dune: got an ssh key so I can add a user on my server?
23:54 <@Dune> sure, sounds good
