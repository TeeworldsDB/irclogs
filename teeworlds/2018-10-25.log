23:03 < Dune> hey minus
23:03 < Dune> are you the one in charge of tagging issues on github or something?
23:03 < Dune> I think I saw you do that
23:12 < minus> i'm not in charge of anything
23:12 < minus> i do have the permissions though
23:12 < Dune> I see
23:17 < minus> (so have heinrich5991 and oy)
23:18 < Dune> I guess tagging issues is a sign that they're valid, so that's probably oy's job
