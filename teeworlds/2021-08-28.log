01:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it's fake proxy servers to gain ip addresses aswell as account data
10:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you can extend your mod to instantly kick players that join via that blacklisted ip or use an external tool that kicks or bans people using that ip with a message about that they joined via a fake server that's stealing their data.
10:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or simoly ban that server's ip.this would at least help against the stealing of account data.
10:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> simply
10:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I guess 'stealing' ips is as simple as hosting a server that's registered with the master servers that can be found in the server search.
10:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dunno what one would gain from that on your server?
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> He just tries to destroy the fun of others, same for ddos during tournaments etc..
14:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Could you help setting up VPN/Proxy filter inside of the mod?
14:24 < rand> is he faking your server or proxying it ?
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Both
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> faking with proxies
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> In order to make players connect to his servers, then they get forwarded to mine and think they are on my Server
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> which they technically are, but with vali inbetween reading chat commanda etc
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yesterday he set up like 20 servers just to do that
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/881158089175359518/unknown.png
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> from a user who reported it in ddnet
14:57 < rand> then, ban vali IP from your server ?
14:58 < rand> at ip level (not teeworlds level)
14:58 < rand> is it possible ?
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> No, he is using fake ips
15:49 < minus> but if it's fake ips shit ain't gonna work at all
15:50 < minus> nor can they capture any kind of traffic
16:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Then its not fake ips, sorry xd
16:28 < rand> do you mean that he's using multiple IP to connect to your server ?
16:28 < rand> unless some pattern, it looks hard to block him indeed
16:29 < rand> but, if it's the same ip as the proxy(ies) server, you could look for fake servers in the server list, and block them on your server
16:30 < rand> you can also forge fake login credential and connecting on his server
16:31 < rand> then ban any packet from the ip trying those credentials
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> he would join with the ip of the proxy servers, so it's rather easily distinguishable
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> my econ vpn/ban server tool would work if you create a list of all of those proxy ips.
