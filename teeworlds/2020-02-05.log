00:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> `add_vote "afternoon" "sv_map test/test"` is working
05:38 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> lol, can somebody on the forum admin side of things set the "remember me" thing by default, that sucked, I just wrote out a case for fixing the fairness in this game and lost it to a login session X(
05:41 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> I think I'll write this out in a serious text editor again tomorrow, and paste it then. anyway, got an account.
11:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> You can normally go back to your text by going back in your browser:/
13:41 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> eh, didn't work this time :P
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> master heinrich was right with the NET_SEEDTIME ðŸ˜®
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm?
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's about some stuff from a few weeks ago xD
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the token stuff kinda kills me currently
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> why's that?
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, just does ._. as I don't get it. at least some details like, when the token is renewed.
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> whether the response from requesting a server list actually may return a new token for further requests or not
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it doesn't return a new token
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you always have to request it yourself
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> note that all my responses are from memory, I haven't checked the source
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> every time within a 16 seconds time frame?
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> NET_SEEDTIME = 16 seconds
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think the old token is accepted as well for the next seedtime
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so that you can be sure that your token is valid for 16s - ping
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm able to have a delay of like 21 seconds or so
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> well, if you get lucky, the token is valid for 32s
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if you're unlucky, it's only 16s
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> or somewhere in between
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ah, ok, but would be best to expect like 15 seconds
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ye
