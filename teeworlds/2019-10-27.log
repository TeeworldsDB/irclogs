00:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's like, you delete one post and instantly another spam post pops up...
01:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's how it is, yes. the forum gets cleaned twice a day, not much more one can do saved from migrating or locking
09:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the teeworlds forum has captchas, right?
10:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> doesnt it have only some tw related questions?
10:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah, no captchas
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune double checked again. it definitely is the rcon auth
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't think this issue is in vanilla
13:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but why would this happen?
13:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> like
13:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> why is the register process fucked by a rcon login?
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't know, seems like it affects the data you send to the masterservers somehow
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `if(Now > m_RegisterStateStart+Freq*60)` what does this mean?
13:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is this to re-check every 60 seconds?
13:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> seems like it
13:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 I believe this bug was introduced in your Protocol Extension or Teehistorian
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Could you check that? Just start a ddnet7 server, wait a minute, login to rcon and wait for the next master ping
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> You should in theory get an error, not responding. Then after that only warnings: no master servers
13:57 < fokkonaut> @Oy
13:57 < fokkonaut> when do we perform a new release?
14:02 < Dune> got an answer from Landil, so there's progress :)
14:02 < Oy> dunno
15:00 < Dune> this settings button is such a mystery
15:00 < Dune> no diff with master on that code chunk
15:07 < Oy> hm, maybe fontsize?
15:19 < Dune> it calls DoButton_MenuTabTop which uses the ms_FontmodHeight constant
15:19 < Dune> probably the height of the CUIRect is messed for some reason
15:47 < Ryozuki> the chat shadow makes the chat look rly ugly
15:48 < Ryozuki> would you accept a change?
15:48 < Ryozuki> it rly drives me mad
15:53 < Oy> LordSK ping ^
15:54 < Oy> Ryozuki: what's the specific problem with it?
15:54 < Ryozuki> it looks really ugly
15:54 < Ryozuki> idk how to describe it
15:54 < Ryozuki> its like you made menus more modern but the chat went back 20 years
15:55 < Ryozuki> just make the chat text looks like the ones in menus
15:56 < Ryozuki> the reason its so ugly is that you use a shadow and not just a outline
15:56 < Ryozuki> like in the text elsewhere
15:58 < Dune> @LordSk
15:58 < Dune> iirc there was an outline in 0.7.0 and it wasn't good at all
15:58 < Ryozuki> why did you change the way its rendered from 0.6?
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Why am I getting pinged here?
16:00 < Dune> I assumed that's because you changed the chat shadows
16:03 < Oy> can't remember what the reason was
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I don't either, we would have to dig up the PR. Either way, we can't please everybody unfortunately. The new look was well received.
16:06 < Ryozuki> thats surprising to me
16:06 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1590
16:10 < Ryozuki> looks rly ugly
16:17 < Oy> new chat is more readable
17:22 < rand> maybe it could be even better
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Ã¶Ã¶Ã¶Ã¶Ã¶ Landil!!
18:50 < Dune> thinking of something, rand?
18:54 < rand> no, I appreciate the work on chat, but I dont use it enough to really notice the changes
18:59 < Dune> does ddnet have rocketjump prediction?
19:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no
19:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well @Dune
19:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what exactly do you mean
19:01 < Dune> if you have a lot of ping and try to rocket jump, the rocketjump will take forever
19:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea
19:02 < Dune> there was no work to help with that?
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well ddnet has a very good antiping system
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @nuborn made that
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> antiping predicts very much since the last update from a few weeks ago
19:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it should also help for grenade jumps
19:05 < Dune> I see, thx
19:09 < ym> Sup. The game works with some issues after major release (don't know exactly which - the one that changed GUI). When I start it from my ordinary WM (StumpWM), there are two blinking 1px width lines on top and right of the screen, seems like rendering issue. When I try to start from TWM or just xterm, the mouse click actions doesn't work at all.
19:09 < ym> Is it known? Can't find similar reports on github nor on forum.
19:09 < Dune> hey ym
19:09 < Dune> Haven't heard of this
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> me neither
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sounds bad :/
19:10 < Dune> maybe that is a common SDL2 issue?
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> then you could try ddnet client ddnet.tw which is pretty much 0.6 but sdl2
19:10 < Dune> you're thinking of the 0.7 update, and it migrated from SDL1 to SDL2, which may be why you're having those issues
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> to test if its sdl2
19:11 < Dune> I bet my beard it's sdl2 :p
19:12 < ym> Aha, got it. Downloading ddnet.tw clone.
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ™‚
19:13 < rand> I dont get what happens when launching from twm/xterm
19:13 < ym> Yep, DDnet version works fine! Thanks!
19:14 < Dune> so it's not sdl2
19:14 < Dune> so there's something about it in 0.7
19:14 < Dune> maybe oy would have an idea, if you open an issue
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rip Dune's beard xd
19:15 < Dune> welp
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ym: ddnet is sadly outdated tho so you wont reach any 0.7 servers with it :/
20:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Dune has a beard :o
21:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i have a beard, too
21:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> whats the point?
21:10 < kma> no oy around? :/
21:10 < kma> oh well, tell him thanks :D
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> not here
21:11 < Dune> kma, will :)
21:11 < kma> Dune: thanks man, hows stuff in teeworlds land now adays?
21:11 < Dune> I think we release pretty soon
21:11 < kma> oh really? I must say I like how everything is just keep going :D
21:12 < Dune> Oy is very regular now, it helps
21:12 < kma> yay \o/
21:12 < Dune> Contributors activity is more sporadic but there are nice spikes :>
21:12 < Dune> I just got a reply from Landil so we're hoping to add a lot more skins :)
21:13 < kma> oh, cool!
21:13 < Dune> how old is Teeworlds, 12?
21:13 < kma> nice, I actually played a bit recently.. awww. I still really do love it
21:13 < Dune> it's a teenager now :D
21:13 < kma> Dune: depends on how you count :)
21:13 < Dune> I don't count pregnancy :)
21:13 < kma> <3
21:13 < Dune> I've been stuck for a month with almost no internet, only teeworlds runs
21:14 < kma> There as been several incarnations, but this one should be.. oh. shit.... way too old :D
21:14 < Dune> ha, gotta make you feel old to see your baby like that :D
21:14 < kma> haha, you have no idea man
21:15 < kma> almost exactly 9 years ago, I had the "oppertunity" to make teeworlds a full time job as well
21:15 < Dune> huh, really?
21:15 < kma> I don't think I've ever told this story
21:15 < Dune> I haven't heard it
21:15 < Dune> is it the s/wars/worlds story?
21:16 < kma> well, no...
21:16 < kma> that is another one
21:16 < Dune> were there any instances of monetized open sourcegames back then?
21:16 < kma> not really, not that I know of
21:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the teewars website was online at around 2002.
21:28 < kma> jxsl13: OMG, please don't tell me stuff like that :D
21:29 < Dune> almost legal huh
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> check out the wayback machine or something like that.
21:51  * kma pokes heinrich5991 
23:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune would it be possible to change the client command /team, as it is often used by ddrace servers.
23:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and having to press esc before enter is kinda weird
23:24 < Dune> :/ yeah ideally proper client-server integration would be best
23:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
23:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> we could do it the same way as for rcon commands
23:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in 0.7 rcon commands actually loaf quite fast
23:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> load*
23:43 < Dune> yeah +1
