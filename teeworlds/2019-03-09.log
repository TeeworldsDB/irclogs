08:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <＃6909> nvm found it
12:46 < minus> i wonder if i should change my quakenet Q password
12:46 < minus> >Pass last set  : 13/04/09 13:14 GMT
12:46 < minus> yes, that's almost 10 years ago

12:49 < minus> >Q: Sorry, but new password is too long (maximum length 10 chars)

17:55 <@Dune> some people (@Thee00, ...) are lagging in teeworlds with good FPS/ping, I wonder how to figure where this comes from
17:55 <@Dune> I lag too when I play windowed with dual screen
18:37 <@heinrich5991> minus: your connection to quakenet is not encrypted anyway :(
18:47 < rand> I play windowed with dual screen, I sense no issue
18:47 < rand> it has been a long time I played on fullscreen/mono screen though
19:29 < minus> welp :D
20:51 < day> dual screen here too. no lags
20:52 < day> except for when i die
