00:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> u better wait 0.9
01:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 1.0 KEK
02:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 0.8 should be a rework of the protocol from ground up
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what do you envision?
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> probably tcp for serverinfo/registration/initial connection
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> you still need to receive udp for input and gamestate
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> http masters? ^^
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> would be great :)
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> looks like a huge task though
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> i think several people already invested some work into this
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/742724271377219604/unknown.png
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> hey, i am getting this error constantly on my server for 0.6 master, any ideas?
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> yes udp would be used for game packets on tees that have already connected properly
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> but the packets that are flooded and spoofed are rarely ever game packets
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> theyre inforequests and connect rquests and to a lesser extent master requests
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> aah
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> and those three things can be tcp
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut disable that message. it's spoofable
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but only on master4
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ?
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> then the attackers just use spoofed input messages?
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> why would they do that?
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> these packets still hit your server
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 i dont see my server in the 0.6 master
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> you can block them earlier in the tw server but best would be in the firewall
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i will just force not to use master4
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but you should also disable that message
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> why?
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> because it's spoofable
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> anyone can send it to you and then your server thinks it's not registered
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so i should completely ignore the packet for 0.6 registering?
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thanks alot
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> worked, thx aagin
14:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i am getting alot of these now tho, but that is still due to the attack i believe:
14:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/742726856826028092/unknown.png
14:52 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 if the server thinks its not registered does this have some effect on anything? Or just printing error messages?
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, it stops the registering process
14:52 < ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut lmao master ban because of the troll dummy report :D
14:52 < ChillerDragon> oh that is crazy!
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
14:53 < ChillerDragon> so one can sucessfuly dos a master connection by spoofing master and claiming it didnt work?!
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in 0.6, on master4, yes
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> on all masters
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> anderson said only on 4
14:53 < ChillerDragon> 0.7 masters use tokens tho?
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> because 1-3 are at servercompass and they have a protection @heinrich5991
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: yes
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> how can they be protected against that?
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i dont know
14:54 < ChillerDragon> servercompass masterrace
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Mr_Anderson
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> then I can't believe that
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or did i misunderstand?
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> without evidence
14:54 < ChillerDragon> go attack em and try heinrich xd
14:54 < ChillerDragon> ill report you for attacking masters heueueu
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Mr_Anderson> master 1-3 cant be spoofed, as they're also located at ovh as your server
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah, that's fine
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Mr_Anderson> master 1-3 cant be spoofed, as they're also located at ovh as your server @fokkonaut
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> anyone tried the macos artifacts from github actions? unlike the `make_release.py` variant, cmake does not embed libpng in the dmg file
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> doesn't cmake call make_release.py?
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no, does not
