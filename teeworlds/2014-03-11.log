11:55 <@minus> header guards are just so damn dangerous when renaming files
11:56 < heinrich5991> #pragma once might be an alternative
11:56 <@minus> yeah
11:56 <@minus> it is
11:56 < heinrich5991> supported at least by gcc, clang and msvc++
11:56 < heinrich5991> but certainly not by all c/c++ compilers
11:56 <@minus> superior in every aspect
11:56 <@minus> who cares about those
11:56 <@matricks> there is almost no reason not to use pragma once now adays
11:56 < heinrich5991> well
11:56 < heinrich5991> superior in that aspect
11:56 <@minus> only using gcc & clang here
11:56 < heinrich5991> minus: superior in any other aspect too?
11:56 <@minus> less to write
11:57 <@minus> not as fugly
11:57 <@matricks> you don't polute any global space
11:57 < heinrich5991> well
11:57 < heinrich5991> c is pretty good at polluting global name spaces, but anyway
11:57 <@matricks> yup
11:58 <@minus> doing C++ though
12:32 < JulianAssange> i accidently my whole 
12:35 <@matricks> btw, I played through Broken Age yesterday <3

16:10 < BotoX> ep20
16:10 <@minus> mh
16:11 <@minus> the railgun part was obvious though
16:13 < BotoX> time to get misaka.is.maiwaifu.jp
16:13  * minus sighs and goes back to doing things
16:13 < BotoX> >doing things
16:13 < BotoX> I am too! Watching anime :3
16:13 <@minus> …horrible things
16:13 <@minus> C++ with Qt to be more specific
16:52 < Thamasky> does anyone know what I should use to create a GUI in C++ ?
16:53 < heinrich5991> people say Qt :)
16:54 < Thamasky> and there isn't a way without Qt?
16:54 < Thamasky> like standard include or sth
16:56 < heinrich5991> there are ways without Qt
16:56 < heinrich5991> you could choose another library
16:56 < heinrich5991> I don't htink you wanna go without some library
16:57 < Thamasky> ok thx heinrich
17:01 < Learath2> unless you have LOTS of time and patience and experience dont go without a lib
17:01 < Learath2> its just painful
17:03  * minus is in a losing battle against Qt right now
17:08  * Thamasky slaps minus around a bit with a large fishbot
17:08 < Thamasky> oh, I named myself Thamasky , oops.
17:08 < Thamasky> I'm CuBe_
17:15 <@minus> dun slap me
17:15 <@minus> unresolved symbols, yay -.-
17:19 < CuBe_> minus: do you use the tools from Qt or not at all
17:27 <@minus> using QtCreator
17:27 <@minus> the software produced is a server
18:02 < CuBe_> minus: what do you mean with that exactly ?

18:05 < BotoX> 10/10
19:22 <@minus> BotoX: lrn2urldecode
19:23 < BotoX> w-why would i
19:23 < BotoX> basename "$(ps h -o cmd $(pidof mpv) | cut -d" " -f1-)"
19:23 <@minus> because it'd be fucking readable
19:34  * BotoX np: [Yousei-raws] To Aru Kagaku no Railgun (Creditless OP) [BDrip 1920x1080 x264 FLAC].mk
19:34 < BotoX> wow, last character has been cut off :<
