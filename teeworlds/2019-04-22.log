11:16 < rand> how to trigger the crash ?
12:05 < TeeSlayer> Catch16 (now 64) is back! Search for L#07 :)
12:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> teeslayer update ur race servers + restart them, very unstable
12:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> check it out yourself if u play on it
12:50 < Dune> would be interesting to know what happens
12:51 < Dune> rand: join different large maps, in my experience. not easy to reproduce, I got Fudgy's settings and that helped
12:57 < Dune> oh, didn't know @Zatline did catch16 maps :)
14:51 < rand> grmbl, I tried connected to a bunch of server with unofficial big map, nothing happened, not fun :| 
14:51 < TeeSlayer> FluffiexD: what exactly is unstable?
14:51 < Dune> yeah takes a bunch of tries
14:52 < TeeSlayer> FluffiexD: I can't reproduce it either
14:52 < TeeSlayer> everything seems fine
14:55 < rand> each time I run tw, my laptop goes wild to +66Â°C, bunch of tries will participate to global warming
14:55 < TeeSlayer> I just asked a bunch of regulars and nobody is having any problems
14:58 < TeeSlayer> therefore I'm not restarting or updating (there are no updates available anyway)
15:50 < Dune> oh ouch
15:50 < Dune> been looking at the code wondering where it went wrong
15:50 < Oy> :P
15:51 < Dune> why did you remove the check in the for loop btw?
15:51 < Oy> it's on top now
15:51 < Dune> ah right
15:51 < Oy> would be duplicate
15:51 < Oy> it was missing on the bottom, where it changed the tiles
15:52 < Oy> but don't think that we need to update the release
15:52 < Oy> easter is over tomorrow :D
15:52 < Dune> yeah that's what I was thinking
15:53 < Oy> well, we could silently sneak it in :D
15:53 < Dune> what is https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1390 btw?
15:53 < Dune> countryflags?
15:55 < Oy> yeah, just the countryflag left
15:55 < Dune> okay
15:55 < Oy> so u see the bots right away in the server browser
15:55 < Dune> is the info there in the server browser? I forgot
15:55 < Dune> it's not just the bot count?
15:56 < Oy> every play in the server info should have a type field (player, spec, bot) and then client calculates the numbers
15:56 < Dune> I see, cool
15:58 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1154
15:59 < Oy> updated first post in https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1390
15:59 < Dune> ack
16:01 < Oy> hm, when i disable compatible version in the server browser i get 30 more servers
16:02 < Oy> oh, seems i'm banned. lol
16:03 < Oy> thought there was some bug with the server infos
16:05 < Dune> huh
16:05 < Dune> got one ip?
16:07 < Oy> it hosts lots of servers, sec
16:07 < Oy> 51.15.34.109
16:10 < Dune> huh okay, not sure why he'd ban you lol
16:10 < Dune> don't think they're doing anything against the rules
16:12 < Oy> yeah, no idea, only play rarely anyway, no problem :)
16:12 < Dune> maybe you were too good and got flagged as a bot :P
16:12 < Oy> maybe someone bad had that ip in the past
16:12 < Oy> :P
16:13 < Dune> without the loli servers you must be seeing like half the players that are on though
16:14 < Dune> 60/83 players are on those currently
16:14 < Oy> 99 servers with 25 players
16:14 < Dune> heh, there are 83 players right now
16:14 < Oy> :D
16:15 < Dune> you must have been underestimating the playerbase :D
16:15 < Oy> yeah :D
16:15 < Oy> usually play on that ctf5 server and that one's still there :)
16:17 < Dune> :)
16:17 < Dune> catch16 looks nice with the 0.7.3 stuff, gj TeeSlayer 
16:17 < Dune> (and oy for making it possible I guess :P)
16:18 < Dune> I only miss the sound of killing people
16:38 < Oy> :D
16:38 < rand> (client side on death ?)
16:39 < Dune> hm?
16:40 < rand> the death sound
16:41 < TeeSlayer> Oy: can you pm me your IP address? you're caught in a range ban
16:42 < rand> blame your people !
16:43 < TeeSlayer> e ~/config/bans.cfg
16:43 < TeeSlayer> eh
16:43 < TeeSlayer> wrong window :D
16:43 < Dune> at least that wasn't a sudo command
16:44 < TeeSlayer> vim^^
16:45 < Dune> "[5cbdd33a][demo_recorder]: Unable to open mapfile 'Grasscatch'" not sure why I'm getting this
16:51 < Oy> odd
16:52 < Oy> when do u get that message?
16:52 < Dune> every start of a game
16:52 < Dune> it's the first time I join a server with that map
16:53 < Dune> okay, it does that even on second try
16:53 < Dune> oooh I think it's because it has the new map format hash
16:54 < Dune> Grasscatch_996c94da872064682c17e3889a1448c03846ba8c234e8c914da8a75fec234743.map
16:56 < TeeSlayer> >catch16 looks nice with the 0.7.3 stuff, gj TeeSlayer
16:56 < TeeSlayer> Dune: it's not my mod
16:57 < TeeSlayer> AssassinTee wrote it
16:57 < Oy> demo recorder doesn't work
16:57 < Dune> oh, so that's who this person was
16:57 < TeeSlayer> the git repo is in the motd of the server
16:57 < TeeSlayer> I used the map_update script to convert the map
16:58 < Dune> the map is fine
16:58 < Dune> it's something with 0.7.3 servers, unrelated the the mod
16:58 < TeeSlayer> okay
17:10 < Oy> dunno if we should update releases now :)
17:10 < Dune> what for, eggs?
17:11 < Oy> no the demo recorder
17:11 < Dune> ah didn't see the commit
17:11 < Dune> irc bot still waiting for his secret :p
17:11 < Dune> well it's a tough one, but probably not 
17:11 < Oy> :D
17:11 < Dune> it affects all OS
17:11 < Dune> 0.7.3 is already in some distributions
17:11 < Oy> yeah
17:11 < Oy> ok
17:11 < Oy> then we should do it with the next release
17:12 < Dune> yeah
17:12 < Dune> or start using the fourth digit that is available in version.h
17:12 < Oy> could do a smaller one sooner maybe
17:12 < Oy> :P
17:13 < Dune> I mean, we always end up having a bug correction one day after
17:13 < Dune> maybe it would be nice to number those fixes without having to do a big announcement
17:14 < Dune> steam and distribs would handle that well
17:15 < Oy> yeah
18:02 < Oy> so do a 0.7.3.1? :)
18:05 < Dune> what do you think, heinrich5991 ?
18:06 < Dune> servers will show up as 0.7.3.1 instead of 0.7.3 too right
18:12 < Oy> no, would just change https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/version.h#L9 and keep the game_version as 0.7.3
18:13 < Dune> ah, that's smart
18:13 < Dune> but would that show up in the client menus creen?
18:13 < Oy> no
18:13 < Dune> maybe modify https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/404430b56cb3bf7d78b5e98a9c855c502094cd5a/src/game/client/components/menus_start.cpp#L91-L103 then
18:18 < Oy> that check seems to work, just displaying the version needs to change https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/404430b56cb3bf7d78b5e98a9c855c502094cd5a/src/game/client/components/menus_start.cpp#L103
18:19 < Dune> right
18:20 < Dune> sounds good then
18:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2098
18:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Does negative ClientID is acceptable ?
18:24 < Oy> Savander huh?
18:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> cause, DBG_DUMMIES send negative clientid
18:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L1521
18:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> to here
18:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L673
18:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> i used vs debugger to check it ouit
18:25 < Dune> oh, it does?
18:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> yea
18:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> if you set up dbg_dummies highter than maxclients
18:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> then it starts from the hightest possible maxclients
18:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> and decrease to the point, where it's negative and more
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> also, what's weird. If you set up dbg_dummies to 8 (with max_clients 8)
18:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> and you join to server, it crashes
18:27 < Dune> makes sense because there is no room for dummies
18:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> can't do nothing more, not C specialist ðŸ˜› Hope i helped
18:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> somehow
18:29 < Oy> yeah, should fix that someday :D
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Idk, maybe something like that will help: 
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander>     if (ClientID >= g_Config.m_SvMaxClients && ClientID < 0)
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander>         return;
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> in OnClientConnected() method
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> it should be "||"
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> xD nope, still crashes
18:32 < Oy> or clamp number of dummies to max clients
18:32 < Dune> - online clients
18:35 < Oy> Savander: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L1520 -> for(int i = 0; i < g_Config.m_DbgDummies && i < Server()->MaxClients(); i++)
18:40 < Oy> anything crucial for 0.7.3.1?
18:40 < Dune> not that I can think of
18:40 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2107
18:41 < Dune> best to avoid features probably :p
18:42 < Oy> yeah
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> That doesn't fixed the crash problem :PP
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> and i can't trace it back, it loops in "dbg_break" method.
18:43 < Dune> loops?
18:44 < Oy> hm, you shouldn't be able to connect when the server is full with dummies
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> yea, like. If i press forword, it keep back to that function, it doesn't even go out of it
18:44 < Dune> well it writes to memory address zero
18:44 < Dune> i guess the debugger refuses to proceed
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> yeah, but I think, I should have the possibility to go back.
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> after all, server says: game\server\player.cpp(11): already used
18:46 < Dune> I don't know how you print the backtrace in this debugger, but you should be able to (?)
18:46 < Oy> ah right
18:46 < Oy> engine doesn't know about the dummies
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Visual Studio Debbuger
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> have options to go back, forward into etc
18:46 < Oy> other issue then
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> At least, we found another one
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> it's good, no? :DD
18:47 < Oy> well, yeah :D
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> In weird way... ðŸ˜„
18:56 < Dune> alright
18:56 < Oy> Dune: you can do ur linux magic :D
18:56 < Dune> gotta do steam and the forum short news
18:57 < Dune> ah, you didn't draft, straight up publish :D
18:57 < Oy> yeah :D
19:11 < Oy> grr
19:30 < rand> dummies are made to crash
19:53 < Dune> :D
20:21 < rand> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/f469fb41da51b1351abca785f0635340bdc8b8b4
20:21 < rand> is it mandatory to drop the "const" for IsBanned ?
20:22 < rand> (looks like it builds with "const" at least)
20:25 < Dune> Oy, cmake uses a hack to check for versions
20:25 < Dune> :(
20:25 < Oy> yeah :(
20:26 < Dune> i was uploading the linux tarballs
20:26 < Dune> i wonder what git log | grep fix.* cmake would give :P
20:26 < Oy> rand: didn't build for me
20:26 < Oy> :D
20:29 < rand> in fact, I only made the method const, not the first paramater of MakeBanInfo
20:29 < rand> CNetBan::MakeBanInfo<CNetRange>(CBan<CNetRange> *pBan...) const
20:33 < rand> it make sense not to use const for the first arg since it can be modified 
20:40 < Dune> i updated the release (but the cmakefiles are not fixed)
20:50 < Oy> seems to work
20:50 < Oy> update the release?
20:51 < Oy> updating the src files might suffice
21:06 < Dune> aight
21:09 < Dune> uploading
21:28 < Dune> shouldn't you move the 0.7.3.1 tag, oy?
21:29 < Dune> > 1 commit to master since this release
21:29 < minus> 0.7.3.1.1 when
21:32 < Dune> not supported by the protocol :D
21:33 < Dune> I'll remove the 0.7.3 downloads entry when this is done
21:37 < Dune> just need steam now
21:44 < Dune> my laptop keeps going to sleep before the upload completes lol
21:58 < Oy> yeah, will move the release and update the source files
21:58 < Dune> okay
22:06 < Oy> done
22:08 < Dune> completing steam upload
22:12 < Dune> all set (need minus magic too)
22:12 < minus> abra cadabra
22:26 < Oy> good :)
22:37 < minus> versionsrv doesn't actually support patch-level changes
22:37 < minus> or does it
22:38 < Oy> should
22:38 < minus> aye, the array is 8 bytes big but only used 5 before
22:38 < Dune> better not update it anyway?
22:39 < minus> too late
22:40 < Oy> hm
22:41 < Oy> minus: did u update the 0.7 version server?
22:41 < minus> do we have one?
22:41 < Oy> yeah
22:41 < minus> i have no idea how this works
22:41 < Oy> the one with port 8285
22:42 < minus> no such thing is running
22:43 < Oy> oh :)
22:49 < Dune> so move the news?
22:50 < minus> i guess? the new version is alreadyon the front page
22:50 < minus> very coordinated release
22:52 < Dune> done, steam is done too
22:52 < minus> yo where's my soldat for linux release
