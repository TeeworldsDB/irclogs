10:22 < Alirezakaj> XXl tomate are you here?
10:26  * Alirezakaj slaps XXLTomate around a bit with a large fishbot
17:28 < needs> @matricks I've read your thoughs about the account system, I still do not understand why you say translation was/is a "big mistake", can you develop a bit more?
17:29 <@matricks> needs: adds too much complexity
17:29 <@matricks> for very little gain
17:30 < needs> matricks: It is a good thing that those who don't undertsnad english can still play this game no?  I mean, this not a "little gain"?
17:31 < needs> Do you think you can practically only use pictures?
17:31 < needs> The UI will be more complex as a result
17:31 <@matricks> I don't think most people need the translations to play the game, and you can make it easier to understand with some ui and icons instead
17:32 <@matricks> needs: adding a string now to the game involved probably over 20 people, thats a huge complexity
17:32 <@matricks> needs: all the UI elements have to work with over 20 different string
17:32 <@matricks> doing any change to the UI now involves so many different test-cases it's insane
17:33 < needs> Oh okay, so the main goal is to not have a single text then?
17:34 <@matricks> I think, that instead of doing translations, adding some pictures and tweaking some english terms and flows would yield a better result with less complexity
17:35 <@matricks> that would mean that one guy could change the UI.. and not like its now, you need 20
17:35 <@matricks> and it would probably take a couple of days for the change instead of minutes
17:36 < needs> I see
17:36 <@matricks> that is the complexity I talk about
17:36 < needs> Okay, I was naively thinking that translation was easy to manage, but it seems I was wrong :)
17:37 <@matricks> it's not :)
17:37 <@matricks> because one guy doesn't know 20 languages
17:37 <@matricks> and it adds 20 different UIs
17:38 <@matricks> specially adding people needed todo a release is.. well.. bad
17:38 < needs> UIs are still pretty much the same no?  I mean only the text inside elements change?
17:38 <@matricks> yes, and sometimes the text doesn't fit and the UI have to change
17:39 <@matricks> some languages some words are really long, others are short
17:39 <@matricks> it affects the UI pretty much
17:39 < needs> okay I see
17:39 <@matricks> ttake the case of adding a button
17:40 <@matricks> you add the button with the english text, have to wait to get the 20 different translations, then test everything and perhaps tweak sizes or the translation
17:40 <@matricks> 20 people to add a button.. and turn-around time for everything
17:41 <@matricks> kill translations, and the development team shrinks from 20 people down to.. well.. 2,3 people :)
17:42 <@matricks> and add more people for redendency and development velocity
17:43 < needs> ok, thank you
17:44 < needs> btw, I read a little bit about game history, is true that the first version was written in C?
17:44 <@matricks> yes
17:44 < needs> If you have to write a new game, would you write it in C again?
17:45 <@matricks> no
17:46 < needs> Ok, that was just for my curiousity, sorry to be bothersome, have a good day :)
17:46 <@matricks> np, and for your information, I probably wouldn't even write it in C++ :)
17:47 < needs> Python then ? :D
17:47 <@matricks> oh god no
17:47 <@matricks> that would be horrible
17:47 < needs> I have to ask, wich language?
17:47 <@matricks> dunno, would probably turn towards rust
17:49 < needs> ok, see you, bye
17:49 <@matricks> bye
