15:56 < WolfAlex> minus: how can i register a ipv6 server to the teeworlds masters?
16:01 <@minus> WolfAlex: no
16:03 < WolfAlex> not possible?
16:04 <@minus> not until it's fixed
16:45 < WolfAlex> ok thx minus, is it possible in the next version of teeworlds?
17:52 <@minus> if someone fixes it
17:53 <@minus> last i checked it was a conceptional problem
18:00 < heinrich5991> minus: what's the problem?
18:00 < heinrich5991> is it only the dual-stack that is a problem?
19:29 <@minus> masters are a problem too on clients with ipv6 but no connectivity
