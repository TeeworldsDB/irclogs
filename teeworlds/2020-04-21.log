01:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Sonix that is definitely not normal
01:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It was never noticed because we didn't add commands to the history before
01:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> oh actually I am happy to report that this was broken before I ever touched this file
01:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> If you sent a message that begins with a /, the history browsing would get stuck there
02:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does anyone know where this line is created: "[2020-02-19 15:52:23][server]: 'Nii' -> 'Nii'
02:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> "
02:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> can't find it
08:57 < rand> player rename iirc
09:17 < rand> it was removed by commit 85b4cfd2455983ae62fe88e838882af0c2f6c3d7
09:18 < wavi> wow lots of discussion here. can someone sum up what the log format changes have been?
10:18 < ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 info change so skin clan or name
10:19 < ChillerDragon> wavi I think most interesting is https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/5090c39d94bad0b6dda8caaef271133c46c00ee0#diff-a2df712cfb938eda9a173f36c865c2cc
10:19 < ChillerDragon> less interesting there is https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/399ed371f690089ee1ef7aa68549792c4b2c8171
10:20 < ChillerDragon> wavi so you are most likley only affected if you parse chat
10:21 < wavi> yeah I parse chat, trying to parse almost everything (for my TW Web GUI)
10:22 < wavi> at some point team change got the from->to format which caught me by surprise
12:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol, how the heck do I get nicknames then by parsing econ... rip
12:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's like the only line indicating anything about a joining player...
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 85b4cfd2455983ae62fe88e838882af0c2f6c3d7 is from 2016.. how the heck do I have that in zCatch if the code is based on 2019 TW master ._.
12:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> non teambased survival.... rip
13:10 < ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 I parse the combination of player has entered the game and team_join see https://github.com/chillavanilla/TeeworldsEconMod/blob/master/test/logs/075_new_id_format.log#L47-L48
13:11 < ChillerDragon> I wonder what this weird out of range is in the next log line does not look healthy
13:11 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/ff8fec0455b5b8958b6af4eb9a1ea523e6207d21/src/game/client/render.cpp#L424
13:11 < ChillerDragon> are markings rotatable?
13:11 < ChillerDragon> could not find rotation feature in skin menu ui
13:12 < ChillerDragon> oh wait its on the body as well what is this rotation thing?
13:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I saw that, but is team_join shown anywhere in survival based game modes?
13:46 < ChillerDragon> idk about survival but team_join is on team switch so I assume on survival joining spec
13:58 < rand> a plyer always joins a team on connection
13:58 < rand> IGameController::OnPlayerConnect()
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> feature request (for real): whisper friends only ðŸ˜›
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I still wonder, why I got this log output in zCatch..... one day I will fix it. but not today.
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thanks rand...
