08:13 < Madara> Where in the code is implented that ./data/ is standard data folder?
08:50 < EastByte> Madara: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/shared/storage.cpp#L8
09:24 < Madara> Thanks EastByte :3
09:38 <@matricks> :P
09:38 <@matricks> gooooooood morning!!!
09:39 < EastByte> good morning matricks 
09:47 <@matricks> sooo.. what is happening today for people?
09:48 < EastByte> I got to learn for school :)
09:51 <@minus> matricks: nothing!
09:53 <@matricks> OMG, such nothing
10:20 <@minus> and, what are you up to today, matricks?
10:20 <@matricks> cleaning the appartment a bit
10:20 <@matricks> getting my rescuechute repacked and dinner with my parents
10:25 < Madara> Rescuechute? For what sport? Parachute, Paraglider, Sailplane.. whatever?
10:37 <@matricks> paragliding
10:39 < Madara> Paragliding is nice :D
10:43 < Madara> Bye
12:14 < JulianAssange> why doesn't my computer lock after 10 minutes while teeworlds is running? :(
12:16 < EastByte> why do I need 100gb storage space to install a mmorpg
12:17 <@matricks> do you want quality textures and sound?
12:17 < EastByte> not really :P
12:17 <@matricks> then install everquest 1
12:17 <@matricks> http://www.zonammorpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/everquest-1.jpg
12:18 < EastByte> hm everquest reminds me to something
12:18 <@matricks> EastByte: an intressting measure when it comes to games are RAM and storage ratio
12:18 <@matricks> because those go and in had more or less
12:20 <@matricks> ratio on xbox was around 60.. on 360 it was 10 which is way to low
12:20 <@matricks> so, if you have 8gb of ram for a game.. well, you should have games in the order of say 20 in storage space, 160gb
12:20 <@matricks> there you go :)
12:21 < EastByte> ehh
12:21 < EastByte> hm
12:23 < EastByte> well, normally it wouldn't matter since we have terabytes of storage
12:23 < EastByte> but I need to install it in a vm
12:23 <@matricks> also.. hmm.. you should take screen resolution into account
12:25 < EastByte> I don't think so
12:25 < EastByte> take a look at minecraft :)
12:27 <@matricks> and I've said it before, minecraft is a terrible game, but another issue
12:27 <@matricks> I'm refering to high quality content stuff more or less
12:43 <@minus> 160GB for one game? that's just 4 BDs!
12:43 <@minus> large ones, that is
12:43 <@minus> or a week of downloading
12:44 <@minus> matricks: that screenshot you posted is not just everquest quality but also jpeg quality. jpeg doesn't like sharp red textures (the font)

20:08 < BotoX> oh my

20:10  * minus blinks skeptically
20:13 < BotoX> m8
20:13  * yemDX laughs at your pleb ass
20:13 < BotoX> M8
20:13 < yemDX> omg bought the figure before even watching the show OMG
20:13 < yemDX> such a gigantic little pleb
20:13 < BotoX> way to enjoy a good show
20:13 < BotoX> together with your dear figure
20:13 < BotoX> pleb
20:13 < yemDX> the point of figs is to support your favorite shows, not to jerk off to
20:13 <@minus> BotoX: s1 + s2 + movie?
20:13 < yemDX> pleb
20:14 < BotoX> s1+s2
20:14 < BotoX> Haven't watched the movie yet
20:14 <@minus> the movie was decent, the show itself not so much
20:14 <@minus> railgun is better
20:14 < BotoX> m8
20:14 < yemDX> you like railgun's anime but dislike index
20:14 < yemDX> wtf 
20:15 < BotoX> I haven't watched railgun yet
20:15 < yemDX> read the manga
20:17 < JulianAssange> /pol/ is the best forum on the internet
20:17 < BotoX> kekeke
20:18 < Inedible> Oops! Google Chrome could not find pol
20:18 < Inedible> Did you mean: polo.­com?
20:18 < BotoX> So, I currently have Elysiums release of railgun, that should be fine, right?
20:18 < yemDX> >watching subs
20:18 < yemDX> oh lord...
20:18 < BotoX> .kb yemDX 
20:20 <@minus> summarizing to aru majutsu no index: index is fucking annoying. touma too. that's it.
20:20 < BotoX> Eh, I didn't feel that way.
20:21 < yemDX> touma's fine, index is probably the worst character in the index universe
20:21 < yemDX> useless, retarded little loli bitch
21:07 < Inedible> it seems my teeworlds run slow in windows 8
21:14 < yemDX> wow something runs not the way it was intended in windows 8
21:14 < yemDX> kinda shocked
21:14 <@matricks> can something run like it's intended under windows 8? :D
21:15 < yemDX> the start menu?
21:15 <@matricks> does it exist? :P
21:16 < yemDX> well, the "metro" menu
21:17 < yemDX> i wonder if this is a windows 8 thing, but all the windows 8 pre-builts i've come across do this weird shut down
21:17 < yemDX> where it's kinda like hibernation but deeper and it won't let you get into the cmos setup
21:18 < yemDX> had to turn it off, it's so annoying
