04:03 < needs1> Doing the math for master servers LIST packets, it turns out 77 servers can fit into a single packet, actually the code only allow 75
04:03 < needs1> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/mastersrv/mastersrv.cpp#L19
04:04 < needs1> Any reasons for a lower limit?
04:05 < needs1> (PACKET_SIZE - PACKET_HEADER_SIZE - sizeof(MSG_LIST)) / sizeof(struct server_addr_raw)
04:06 < needs1> With PACKET_SIZE = 1400, PACKET_HEADER_SIZE = 6 and sizeof(MSG_LIST) = 8
04:07 < needs1> And sizeof(struct server_addr_raw) = 18
04:09 < needs1> So (1400 - 6 - 8) / 18 == 77
04:16 < needs1> It means theoretically one master server can handle up to 1232 servers.  Actually it is 1200.
04:19 < needs1> Not a big deal since there is too much servers for the number of players, but it also reduce the number of packets sent for each listing
