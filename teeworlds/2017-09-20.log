16:36 < nemo2> wow and I thought our channel was dead ☺
16:42 <@matricks> njet
16:44 < Hausdorff> so what's hedgewars anyway, like "tank wars" but with smaller, rounder and pinker tanks?
16:46 <@matricks> "Hedgewars is a free and open-source turn-based strategy artillery game"
17:38 < nemo2> Hausdorff: genre spawned by W*rms which was itself a lemmings/scorched earth mashup
17:39 <@matricks> there was a home slew of pixel based games back then, the moon lander games seems to have died off however
18:12 < nemo2> matricks: I like to play a mode in heedgewars I call "lunar lander" in homage to that genre
18:12 < nemo2> is no movement, infinite saucer, 'zooka/nade  played in small maze with tons of instant mines
18:13 < nemo2> usually w/ Earthrise theme ☺
19:03 <@matricks> minus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkrwUzWeACg

19:06 <@heinrich5991> this video is not available [in germany I guess]

19:08 <@matricks> NIEDER MIT DEM REGIME!
19:09 <@matricks> haha, the german voices :D
19:09 <@matricks> I'm so used to the english ones
19:09 < EastByte> I guess the germans also speak german in the english version?
19:09 <@matricks> yes
19:09 <@matricks> and all other languages
19:09 <@matricks> New Order had like 7 spoken languages in it
19:10 <@matricks> dunno about new colossus actually

19:57 <@minus> lol
20:01 <@minus> god the german dub is awful
20:01 <@minus> was wolfenstein always a serious sam?
20:09 <@matricks> a serious sam?
20:09 <@minus> do you not know serious sam?
20:10 <@minus> a series of games by croteam
20:11 <@matricks> yeah, but I don't get that sentence
20:11 <@matricks> it has never had anything todo with serious sam
20:11 <@minus> but it looks awfully similar, gameplay-wise
20:12 <@minus> "just fire lots of bullets at everything"
20:12 <@minus> it's a console game, isn't it?
20:12 <@matricks> all platform
20:12 <@matricks> and serious sam and wolfenstein plays a lot differently
20:12 <@matricks> sam has tons of enemies, wolf as way fewer
20:13 <@matricks> sam is in the 100s at the time, wolf is more like.. 10
