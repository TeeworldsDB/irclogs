13:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @jason54 | BlackPast can you maybe stop cloning my entire server?
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> There is my server with BlmapChill and everyone's account, why would you run the same map and mod without the accounts of everyone?
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Would be cool if you can take it down again :)
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think it does not matter, as long as the server's name is not the same. People will keep playing on your server in any case, as it holds their stats.
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `Graphics()->SetColor(1.0,1.0,1.0,0.3f);`
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> this fails for me, it doesnt apply alpha, just white color
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> setting all 1's to 0's works, but of course it is dark then
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ddnet has a config variable, `m_GfxQuadAsTriangle`, that fixes this bug
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah there are some strange things with SetColor
17:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i hate teeworlds UI
17:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> programming it
17:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> /agree
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @fokkonaut try `Graphics()->SetColor(0.3f,0.3f,0.3f,0.3f);`
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> basically multiply the rgb values by the alpha value
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> that's also the reason why the debug ghost is not transparent in 0.7
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> however, the quads as triangles option should not influence this
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it does, the command description even tells you it does
