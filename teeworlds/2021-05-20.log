14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> OFTC.net is the other main open source friendly IRC network. - From reddit user joeyh - this may need some evaluation
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> oh, I linked the thread for some background, not as a suggestion for other IRC networks to use
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> And I posted the answer as a possible solution for your problem - I think OFTC.net is not `part of the league of evil and all`
16:24 < minus> Not like tw needs to be present on more than 1 network
16:25  * minus goes set up irc.teeworlds.com
16:54  * rand failed to connect to irc.teewords.com and to join the single channel
16:55 < rand> for discord user, quakenet is an irc server ;)
17:25  * bridge [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> uploaded an image: (59KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ZGMvWiIjfBhACMXLGWVoTsTw/image.png >
17:25 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> that looks scetchy xd
17:26 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> having a selfhosted irc server would be cool tho i would join :D
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> no one but people already aware of the quakenet channel would join
17:32 < Learath2> a handful of people remain on quakenet anyway, I don't think this needs to be on multiple networks either
17:45 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> no there is no need but it still would be cool to have a teeworlds network wouldnt it?
17:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's not effortless and there are a lot of other stuff that could use some effort
20:08 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon irc > matrix
20:46 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> chillerdragon, I'll run a Unrealircd network, sure :D As long as I don't need to pay for it lol
20:46 < bridge> [freenode] <seabass[m]> (much cheaper than running a Matrix server mind you)
21:15 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> eww irc maximalists xd
21:16 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i miss proper chat history and easy to use encrypted chats in irc
22:13 < minus> history? meh, tho hard to judge as a bouncer user
22:14 < minus> encrypted? sure, would be nice for for PMs and private chats, but effectively pointless for public/open channels
