00:39 < WolfAlex> minus: ping
00:39 < Fels> poooong
00:39 < WolfAlex> no Fels! i pingd minus :D
00:39 < Fels> no you didnt! D:
00:39 < Fels> i got the piing~
00:40 <@minus> pong
00:40 < WolfAlex> minus: modded server running @ 79.133.50.38:8313 as CTF, adds chatcommands
00:43 <@minus> that's actually like 10 servers
00:43 < WolfAlex> (gameplay is unmodded if i see correct, only added command is /info and when you join you get a message)
00:46 <@minus> too bad i don't know the exact ban policy
00:47 <@minus> doesn't seem so severe, so i'll just leave it and matricks or heinrich5991 judge
00:47 <@minus> night
00:47 < WolfAlex> night
00:47 < heinrich5991> minus: you're the only one with access to the bans though, right?
00:47 < WolfAlex> xD
06:37 <@matricks> minus: anything that isn't the vanilla code is considered modded
06:38 <@matricks> minus: easiest rule
09:51 < user> What does a ! before a servername mean?
10:05 <@minus> the ! in the triangle? it's a modded server
10:06 < user> no, the server name
10:07 < user> https://i.imgur.com/Jd8ej8N.png
10:08 <@minus> oh, that means that the server owner is a retard
10:09 < user> i assume it's an attempt to get to the top of alpha. order?
10:09 <@minus> yeah
11:23 < heinrich5991> well no
11:23 < heinrich5991> that means the server owner knows how to get their server popular
11:23 < heinrich5991> because of the default sorting in the vanilla client
11:24 < heinrich5991> minus: my call would be banning the server btw
11:25 < heinrich5991> I think no matter which rule set we employ, the server does not fall within it
11:25 < heinrich5991> it's either a modded server or a reverse proxy in front of the server
11:43 < deen> heinrich5991: well, i also know that DDNet would be more popular if i called the servers "!         DDNet" but I still find it wrong to abuse the sorting to get more players
11:45 < heinrich5991> I wouldn't do that either, but that doesn't mean that "the server owner [who does that] is a retard"
12:27 < Fels> oink
12:38 < Learath2> lets have a vote to ban all those retarded servers :P
14:54 < Fels> oink
16:31 < Landil_> is there an explanation about the automapper somewhere?
16:33 < heinrich5991> maybe this? https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=8886
16:35 < Landil_> hmmm
16:35 < Landil_> thx heinrich5991 
17:09 < Landil_> I've got a top left corner, which consists out of 2 tiles. No problem to automap the left tile, but what's the rule for the one right next to it?
18:13 < Oy> the automapper has to be reworked for 0.7
18:14 < Oy> and the current rules aren't correct
18:18 < BeaR__> Is the master branch up-to-date? I'm seeing a lot of closed issues and PRs but no commits.
18:18 < BeaR__> ah now
18:37 < Oy> minus: do you still want to change sth regarding this https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1293 ?
18:39 <@minus> nope, closed
18:40 < Oy> good
18:41 <@minus> do you have time and want to push for 0.7 or what's the matter?
18:43 < Oy> yeah want to go for a 0.7 release this year
18:44 < Oy> checking what needs to be done, issues etc. - so i stumbled on that one
18:46 <@minus> it was from january. i think that\s when i was checking through all the tickets
19:34 < heinrich5991> Oy: is the format convertible, does the new automapper format convey the same information?
19:34 < heinrich5991> (i.e. could I quickly hack up a conversion script in case Landil needs it?)
19:36 < BeaR__> heinrich5991: it should be possible
19:36 < BeaR__> just changed to json
19:39 < Oy> yeah just json for now
19:41 < Oy> had a script that i used to convert them, but dunno where that is
19:45 <@minus> >ive a simple but really important question. Is it possible to edit the default server-filter settings? Because all the new players are not able to see mods like instagib and this makes me pretty sad :s
19:47 < Oy> uncheck "standard gametype" in the server filter
19:49 <@minus> that's not what he's complaining about
19:50 <@minus> he's running mods and new players don't see them because they're filtered by default
