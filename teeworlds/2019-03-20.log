19:43 < TeeSlayer> can somebody check if my server is laggy? for example L#16
19:43 < TeeSlayer> some people are claiming they are lagging, however I don't notice any lags :/
19:47 <@Dune> the zomb server at least looks just fine
19:56 < TeeSlayer> Thanks, apparently it just got better for one who complained
22:30 < minus> huh, ddnet now uses websockets?
22:31 < minus> wrong channel probably
22:33 <@heinrich5991> ddnet has had support for websocket conections on the server for a long time â€” used to power the web client
22:52 < minus> Latest AUR package upgrade requires libwebsocket
23:07 <@Dune> I guess they forgot the dependency?
23:15 <@heinrich5991> they enabled the optional dependency
