08:34 < piie> hello, I'm currently trying to port latest teeworlds over to rg351 handheld devices using gles.  I have it compile clean and can run it without any errors on the log output.  Unfortunately there's only a black screen, but the background music is running.  Anybody interested in helping me on this topic?
08:35 < piie> I've got quite some experience on cross compiling, but unfortunately little to no experience on gl
18:58 <@heinrich5991> hmm. I have no experience with opengl eitherâ€¦
19:02 <@heinrich5991> piie: maybe check out #ddnet, it seems Jupstar (who is on the discord side of that channel) might be able to help you
23:16 < piie> heinrich5991: thanks for this hint, will get in touch with him
