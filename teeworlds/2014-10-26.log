15:51 < tomew> hello, have "str_format" a parameter limit? o_o
15:53 < heinrich5991> tomew: no. you have to provide exactly as many arguments as you specify in the format string
15:53 < heinrich5991> can you send the line where you're str_format
15:53 < heinrich5991> ?
15:55 < tomew> http://pastebin.com/n6num7kr
15:59 < heinrich5991> tomew: how is aBuf defined?
15:59 < tomew> char aBuf[255];
16:01 < heinrich5991> this means that the string will at most be 255 characters long
16:01 < tomew> i know
16:01 < heinrich5991> shouldn't hit the limit though
16:01 < heinrich5991> what's the output of that str_format?
16:02 < tomew> name='0:Tomew' ip='127.0.0.1:9527' ping='0' onlinetime='0'
16:02 < tomew> at onlinetime='0' should be another number instead of 0
16:04 < heinrich5991> tomew: what type does GetTick return?
16:04 < tomew> int32
16:05 < heinrich5991> maybe it actually returns 0?
16:05 < heinrich5991> have you tried outputting it in a different position?
16:05 < tomew> yup, with dbg_msg("-.-", "%d", GetTick()); i got a "good" output
16:21 < tomew> <_<
16:22 < heinrich5991> tomew: found the error?
16:22 < tomew> nope ._.
16:23 < heinrich5991> you could try outputting it twice in your format string, once in the front, once in the back
16:23 < tomew> oke
16:24 < tomew> still the same
16:25 < heinrich5991> both are zero?
16:26 < heinrich5991> tomew: ?
16:27 < tomew> i did it like that: http://puu.sh/crmD3/977dd708ad.png
16:30 < heinrich5991> tomew: can you give me your GetTick function?
16:30 < tomew> int GetTick() { return m_Tick; };
16:30 < tomew> int64 m_Tick;
16:32 < heinrich5991> might it be that the lower 32bit of m_Tick are zero?
16:35 < tomew> i dont know, i tried to change "int GetTick() ..." to "int64 GetTick()" but with no output changes
16:36 <@minus> need to use %lld for formatting then
16:36 < heinrich5991> yes
16:39 < tomew> ok
16:40 < tomew> still works, thank you :)
