17:46 < ChillerDragon> there are 90 open prs and the last merge was 1 year ago can we do something about that? Oy is clearly too inactive to be the only person merging. @heinrich5991 you technically also have the power to do so right? any chance you could click a few merge buttons?
17:46 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I was more or less instructed not to do that
17:46 < ChillerDragon> i see
17:47 < ChillerDragon> so who has merge power theoretically and who practically?
17:48 < ChillerDragon> instructed by whom? Oy? can you get him on here? If it keeps staying like this it will either hold new contributors back or create a fork.
17:49 < ChillerDragon> compiling throws a bunch of deprecation warnings and the prs fixing those are almost deprecated again before they get merged
17:58 < bridge> <heinrich5991> practically Oy, maybe Dune, idk
19:00 < minus> i mean, i'd rather have you do it and throw inactive leadership out if they're inactive (which implies they don't care)
