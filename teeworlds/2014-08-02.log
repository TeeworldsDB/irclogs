10:24 <@minus> matricks: just found your video from teneriffe on my hdd. 60fps makes it look glorious
11:19 < teetow> BUT YOU CAN'T SEE 60 FPS LOLOLOOLO
11:23 <@minus> speaking of 60fps
11:23 <@minus> ima boot windows
14:17 < heinrich5991> teetow: one does see the difference between 30fps and 60fps
14:17 < heinrich5991> it's just the wrong way to look at it
14:18 < teetow> ...
14:18 < teetow> I know.
14:18 < heinrich5991> kk :)
14:18 < teetow> the LOLOLOLO didn't clue you in? =)
14:20 < heinrich5991> wasn't sure
14:24  * minus slaps heinrich5991 with the obvious
14:24 <@minus> still haven't booted windows :/
14:56 <@minus> yeah, i think i'll have to reinstall windows
21:16 < MertenNor> I got my Oculus Dk2 the other day..
21:16 < MertenNor> what about Oculus Rift support for Teeworlds :P
21:17 <@minus> do it
21:18 < MertenNor> minus I would but have no idea how..
21:33 < EastByte> well, build a nice monitor in blender and display teeworlds on it in a 3d office room
21:33 < EastByte> so you can play teeworlds in a virtual office
21:39 < MertenNor> EastByte ha would be cool :)
