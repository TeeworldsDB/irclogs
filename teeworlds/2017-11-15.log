16:26 < pinkieval> looks like a way to avoid suffering the DDoS is changing the IP address of the server after the DDoS starts
16:26 < pinkieval> unfortunately, that also removes the server from the list of favorite servers
16:26 < pinkieval> (on the client)
16:52 < Learath2> pinkieval: and not really easy or quick to change an ip on a server
16:53 < Learath2> you could probably use a failover ip and null route the original
16:55 < pinkieval> Learath2: it depends on your provider
16:56 < pinkieval> I choose a provider that allows me to do that predicting I would get ddosed at some point
16:56 < pinkieval> chose *
16:56 < pinkieval> it's only four or five clicks in a web interface
16:56 < Learath2> well on many providers extra ipv4 adresses not only cost money but also require a reasoning deemed valid by them and RIPE
16:57 < pinkieval> my provider allows me to change the public ip of my vps
16:57 < Learath2> even after you get it all setup and change your ip mid game, all your clients drop and all the ddosser has to do is to change the target ip :)
16:57 < pinkieval> so it's always an IP in their block
16:57 < pinkieval> yeah
16:57 < pinkieval> but the ddoser seems to take some time to change its target
17:01 < Learath2> it helps if your provider has the capacity to just swallow the attack and they have a firewall that lets you drop the packets before it hits your server
17:13 < pinkieval> in theory it has DDoS mitigation
17:13 < pinkieval> but it's hard to detect DDoS on UDP when legitimate traffic uses UDP too
17:13 < pinkieval> and the same port
