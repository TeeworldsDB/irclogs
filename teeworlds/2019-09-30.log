13:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> forum.
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> already done apparently
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> still punBB ðŸ˜›
17:15 < minus> punbb hasn't seen a release in 4 years :/
17:49 < Ryozuki> 3*
17:50 < Ryozuki> oh its 4
17:50 < Ryozuki> is it hard for tw to switch to a new forum?
18:05 < Dune> they got bought by some company, right?
18:29 < minus> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
18:29 < minus> punbb has always been on informer.com, hasn't it?
18:30 < minus> should probably migrate to something with updates unless teeworlds.com wants to end up on haveibeenpwned.com
18:31 < Dune> Would be nice to have some stronger filter too, spam is 2x a day atm :(
18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/script/import_scripts/punbb.rb
18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Importing from punbb seems officially supported by Discourse
19:11 < Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11056
19:32 < minus> 5 years wow
19:32 < minus> not a huge fan of discourse
19:38 < Dune> there is no consensus in the topic either
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> last time I checked, the conversion script wasn't very good
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> flarum looks good too, we might want to test it as well
19:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> What about flarum or vanilla
19:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Ah lordsk was faster ðŸ˜›
19:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> this vanilla? https://vanillaforums.com/en/
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Yes
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Is it paid
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Wasnt it free
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> It has 2 versions apparently https://vanillaforums.com/en/software/
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I'm not sure I like this one though
19:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Here is an example of it https://forums.oculusvr.com/community/
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> minus or anyone that has access, can I get a snapshot of the punbb database?
20:16 < minus> yes
20:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> thank you
20:17 < minus> wait no
20:17 < minus> i have access, but i can't just give you a snapshot
20:17 < minus> who are you even
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Does it matter?
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it contains PMs
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> oh
20:18 < minus> and email address, password hashes and ip addresses
20:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Right well will anyone who has access right now, test out the forums options we pointed at earlier?
20:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm. it's not on the tw.com server, is it?
20:23 < Dune> @heinrich5991 you mean the punbb db?
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
20:56 < minus> yeah, it's on a different machine
20:56 < minus> connection info is in the forum config
20:56 < minus> /etc/borg/borg-run has the mysqldump command used for backups
21:00 < Ryozuki> phpbb looks alike and its updated
22:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> weren't there supposed to be some kind of moderator accounts for the rcon? Where can I find the docimentation?
22:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> phpBB super sucks. I'm highly for discourse, as it has a rather fluid user experience and people are able to respond fast. A test instance on discourse.teeworlds.com would be neat.
22:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> also maybe a flarum test site.
22:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we had a test instance actually ðŸ˜›
22:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but without any data?
22:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no
22:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> wit hthe data
22:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm. maybe redirect people to the test instance?
22:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or announce it at least visibly
22:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> on the front page?
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> moderator commands documentation anywhere?
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Forum is kinda dead, sadly.
22:56 < Dune> we had a test instance, years ago. check today's log
22:56 < Dune> and the docs are there: https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=help
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I don't find anything about the moderator "admin level" in the server config there.
23:08 < Dune> well then it's missing, someone gotta update the docs
23:09 < Dune> `src/engine/server/server.cpp:   Console()->Chain("mod_command", ConchainModCommandUpdate, this);`
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thanks.
23:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> `sv_rcon_mod_password`
