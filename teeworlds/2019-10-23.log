10:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> can jxsl get forum rights? :/ pls
12:46 < rand> just fork the forum on reddit
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I wonder, why teeworlds has no own subreddit
17:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might be a great marketing stunt?
17:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> https://www.reddit.com/r/teeworlds/ seems like we have one?
17:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we have always had one; it was never very popular. some clans like Qi used reddit iirc
21:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> we should pimp the sub reddit with graphics gives it a more authentic look
22:35 < louis> sup
