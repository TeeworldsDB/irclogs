15:34 <@matricks> minus: clang is starting to produce some really neat tools :D
17:52 <@minus> matricks: you threw me the bait, now tell me the rest!
17:57 < heinrich5991> matricks: do you know how to properly render transparent things? the bad method involves rendering several parts with the same alpha over each other, which results in different total alphas (where multiple parts overlap). do you know how to avoid this phenomena?
17:59 <@matricks> minus: look up the clang-tools
17:59 <@matricks> minus: like clang-check, clang-format, oclint etc
18:00 < BotoX> heinrich5991: alpha blending
18:00 <@matricks> heinrich5991: you mean that the depending on the order you render them, the picture becomes different?
18:01 <@minus> matricks: too lazy :D
18:01 < heinrich5991> matricks: no, I mean if I have something (like a tee) that consists of multiple parts that need to be rendered, then the resulting image on the screen has less alpha where multiple such parts overlap (such as body and feet)
18:01 < heinrich5991> as opposed to having the same alpha over the whole thing
18:02 < BotoX> _alpha blending_
18:02 < BotoX> there's different modes
18:02 <@matricks> do you mean the alpha in the target-buffer?
18:03 <@matricks> oh.. wait.. you want two overlapping circles to behave as one
18:03 <@matricks> or.. like fading out a tee without the parts behind start showing through
18:04 < heinrich5991> the last thing
18:04 < heinrich5991> like that you start to see the weapon behind the tee
18:04 <@matricks> bit tricky, but can be done
18:04 <@matricks> simplest would be to render it to a separate target with normal full alpha
18:05 <@matricks> and then render a quad with that
18:05 <@matricks> or, you could do reverse painters algorithm with a depthbuffer to prevent overdraw
18:06 <@matricks> first method is probably cleaner
18:19 < heinrich5991> k
18:20 <@matricks> oh, I like letters to
18:20 <@matricks> like...
18:20 <@matricks> w
18:20 < heinrich5991> this was ment to be 'ok', which is arguably longer
18:20 < heinrich5991> thank you :)
21:48 <@matricks> minus: btw, http://www.theonion.com/video/sponsored-new-wolfenstein-game-lets-players-choose,36009/
21:53 <@minus> brutal canadian occupation, lol
21:55 <@minus> matricks: i'll buy it!!11
21:58 <@matricks> :P
21:59 <@matricks> it's coming out next tuesday
21:59 <@minus> matricks: already buying it off the pirate bay!
22:00 <@matricks> the uncensored version? :P
22:00 <@minus> anyway, good night
22:00 <@minus> :D
