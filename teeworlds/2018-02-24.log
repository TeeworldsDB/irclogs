21:25 < day> seeing that theres no proper counter to defensive nade spamming i was thinking maybe allow the pistol to destroy projectiles
21:25 < day> i think it could create cool moments when you smash through at high speed while spamming the pistol :D
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Nibiru> Nice idea tho
21:50 < Edible> there is a proper counter
21:50 < Edible> evading :)
21:51 < day> no
21:51 < Edible> yes
21:51 < day> no
21:51 < Edible> yeh
21:52 < day> so you can accelerate while moving off the ideal flight route?
21:52 < day> thats impressive
21:52 < day> you evade -> you slow down -> he gets away
21:52 < day> you dont evade -> damage
21:52 < Edible> then you chase some more
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Nibiru> There is another way to avoid spamming
21:53 < Edible> look, if the gun can explode nades then the shotgun can explode nades
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Nibiru> Just dont play ctf5
21:53 < day> nibiru: if only that map got deleted...if only :P
21:53 < Edible> that too, and even with ctf5 spamming there are tactics you can take also
21:54 < Edible> which i wont say n.n
21:57 < Edible> but that would be nice, shotgun explode nades, and maybe the hammer can block the laser
