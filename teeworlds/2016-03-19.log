12:39 < Obani> Is there someone here knowing someone named Bifidus Actif ?
13:57 < Obani> I have something to ask
13:57 < Obani> I've made a fng map
13:58 < Obani> But I can't test it on multiplayer cause I can't open a port to host a server
13:58 < Obani> So would someone like to test it with me and maybe some other people ?
14:01 < jxsl13_> you dont need to open a port to test a map locally
14:02 < Obani> "locally"
14:02 < jxsl13_> local server
14:03 < Obani> I already passed few hours playing with dummies
14:03 < jxsl13_> on your pc
14:03 < Obani> On that map
14:03 < Obani> I would like to know if it's well playable in true multiplayer
14:03 < jxsl13_> ah, you want it to be tested y others, didnt read your sentence completely
14:04 < jxsl13_> by*
14:04 < Obani> :)

14:05 < Obani> I talked in-game to some people that told me that they were on IRC, but I can't see them :/
