13:18 < Learath2> @LordSk feel free to take a look at #2509, I'll finish it up but I need to take a day or two
13:19 < Dune> oh, doesn't look bad :)
13:19 < Learath2> When I did the listbox I wasn't really thinking forward and now I want a way to add icons to the left and a way to return a key instead of the index of the selected entry
14:10 < Learath2> heinrich5991: Re:serverinfo I think that's unintentionally what I was doing aswell. The entry exists before the main packet
14:16 < Learath2> I don't get why 2492 keeps failing to compile, that variable is not unused
14:24 < Dune> 2509 fails for teeworlds\src\game\editor\ed2_ui.cpp(522,52): warning C4305: 'argument': truncation from 'double' to 'T' [D:\a\teeworlds\teeworlds\debug\teeworlds.vcxproj]
14:25 < Learath2> I have no idea what that even means
14:25 < Dune> 2492 only fails with cmake, somehow
14:25 < Dune> Learath2: he doesn't know if he should use float or double I think?
14:26 < Dune> you have to specify the .f
14:26 < Dune> 	const vec4 ButtonColorLight(0.162f, 0.1, 0.29f, 1);
14:26 < Learath2> oh, I was going so quick throwing the colors out there I missed that :P
14:26 < Learath2> yeah, 0.1 indeed is a double
14:27 < Dune> I'll go for a meeting and have a look
15:01 < Learath2> Idk who has access to the settings of the repo but you should disable circleCI
15:17 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: tried disabling it, no idea if it works
15:17 <@heinrich5991> didn't really find it
15:37 < Ryozuki> heinrich5991 are you here?
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> kinda but not really
15:40 < Ryozuki> heinrich5991 what do you think about using findfreetype that is bundled from cmake instead of our own
15:40 < Ryozuki> it is there since 3.0.3 iirc
15:40 < Ryozuki> maybe earlier
15:40 < Ryozuki> there is also a warning in cmake rn 
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I'd like to not use cmake-specific `Find*` for the most part
15:40 < Ryozuki> why not
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it makes things harder to debug when they fail
15:41 < Ryozuki> are you sure
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> pretty sure, I'd need to find the version of their `Find*` script before starting to debug it
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> is there a motivation to use them here?
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if there is, we can consider changing to them
15:42 < Ryozuki> no u go to /usr/share/cmake and ur set
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> these change from cmake version to cmake version
15:42 < Ryozuki> i would relly more on it and also we got a warning, due to having our freetype named ownfreetype
15:42 < Ryozuki> and we cant use freetype as is cuz it says a warning about shadowing their script
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> because of `FindOpenGL` I guess
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we could patch that out, I didn't like that in the first place
15:43 < Ryozuki> ?
15:43 < Ryozuki> what about findopengl
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we use cmake's `FindOpenGL`
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I'd guess it's causing the warning
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> because it also looks for freetype
15:43 < Ryozuki> no its not
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> where does the other freetype come from?
15:44 < Ryozuki> i think you should check the warning beforehand
15:44 < Ryozuki> you may be confusing things
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> can you paste it?
15:44 < Ryozuki> ec
15:44 < Ryozuki> sec

15:45 < Ryozuki> this is cuz we have ownfreetype.cmake to not shadow cmake one
15:46 < Ryozuki> oh
15:46 < Ryozuki> it may be because opengl at the end
15:46 < Ryozuki> when i rename our findownfreetype to findfreetype i get this

15:47 < Ryozuki> still, using bundled freetype script solves the issue fast
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no, you still have to care about using the fallback for ourselves
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> maybe we can just use our own opengl thing
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> then we can rename freetype back
15:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Ryozuki or to quickly fix it, you can use `cmake_policy(SET CMP0017 NEW)` and rename freetype back
15:52 < Ryozuki> ok
16:24 < Ryozuki> are you against using macros?
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> wdym?
16:24 < Ryozuki> i notice a common pattern, its even documented, in cscrollregion you always init it the same way
16:24 < Ryozuki> so i thought why not make a macro
16:25 < Ryozuki> menus.h L184
16:25 < Ryozuki> even adding a rect is repetitive
16:30 < Ryozuki> nevermind
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Changing the defaults would be more sound, but I thought it's not worth it to break mods, so I didn't do it
18:19 < Ryozuki> ecdsa or rsa?
18:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> For?
18:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ecdsa is more efficient IIRC
18:45 < Ryozuki> i see
