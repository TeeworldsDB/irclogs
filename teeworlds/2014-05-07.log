11:52 < ghost91> hey, does anybody know if srand() is called sometime on the stratup of the server?
11:53 < ghost91> CGameContext::ConShuffleTeams uses rand(), and I want to implement another function using randomness, but I need to be sure that it’s „really“ random
11:53 <@minus> ghost91: srand does not seem to be used in teeworlds
11:54 < ghost91> I guess we should do this then (maybe on server startup or whatever, so it is called exactly one time..?)
11:54 < ghost91> otherwise, we always use the standard random seed
11:55 < ghost91> which makes things…. not really random :D
11:56 <@minus> patch it
19:05 < Teetime> There's a spam account in the forum https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/search.php?action=show_user_topics&user_id=125700
19:20 < heinrich5991> ghost91 not here :8

23:39 < heinrich5991> horicontally in the middle
23:39 < heinrich5991> the bottom box
23:39 < heinrich5991> there's a 'More Details' link
23:40 < MertenNor> Line 42: Type  "src/game/client/components/menus_demo.cpp:386 "
23:40 < MertenNor> that can still mean 2 things.. xD
23:40 < heinrich5991> it's Type: server vs Type: client
