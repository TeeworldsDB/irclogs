22:42 <@minus> matricks: i take it you still didn't answer to those Indie Game Battle guys since they sent another email on monday?
22:44 <@matricks> havn't answered
22:44 <@matricks> been super busy :/
22:45 <@matricks> and I dunno what I should answer
22:47 <@minus> well, either "okay" or "rather not"
22:48 <@matricks> is "yawn." a valid response?
22:49 <@minus> that's ambiguous. yawn as in 'eh, not something like that again' or 'booooooring' or idk
22:49 <@minus> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
22:50 <@minus> p.s. if you answer CC info@teeworlds.com
