14:35 <@heinrich5991> usually he does
14:35 <@heinrich5991> hmmmm
14:58 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> hey Landil
14:58 < Landil> How can I serve you
14:58 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> How do you make little landils?
14:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Let me get closer
14:59 < Dune> better
14:59 < Landil> shake the big balls and *boom* ... the same way as tees spawn
15:00 < Dune> well I hope all is fine in Landil's home
15:00 < Landil> everthing's fine except the lack of time
15:00 < Landil> I don't have any real hobbies anymore
15:00 < Dune> I heard that happens, yeah :|
15:00 < Dune> well, tradeoffs :)
15:01 < Landil> yeah
15:01 < Dune> so, teeworlds!
15:01 < Landil> so let's get back to business
15:01 < Dune> serious things now
15:01 < Dune> we still have an active graphics team with talented people
15:01 < Dune> your apostles are spreading the word
15:02 < Dune> but it's sometimes difficult to get a consensus on design decisions
15:02 < Dune> the only high-priority task for the next version is the server browser
15:03 < Dune> Oy is working a lot on that, and needs mockups and directions
15:03 < Dune> Namely we have to design a friend tab: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1638
15:04 < Dune> this is a summary of the current state of things for the server browser: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1538#issuecomment-435576568
15:05 < Dune> we also have a discussion about scaling the ammo in the HUD, now that it has changed a little bit
15:05 < Dune> but I'd need to make screenshots for you to see
15:06 < Dune> Gametype icons are also a hot small issue: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1637
15:06 < Dune> we'd love your input on that (what kind of icon to use for deathmatch?)
15:06 < Dune> that's already a lot :)
15:06 < Landil> *reading*
15:07 < Dune> bonus: there is this Zatline's suggestion - https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1619
15:08 < Landil> k
15:08 < Landil> gonna have a look at it
15:09 < Dune> great, thank u :)
15:12 < Dune> (oops)
15:12 < Dune> HUD scaling, current: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/355114/48418755-65726680-e756-11e8-96a5-659fdecc227f.png
15:59 < Dune> got to go at 4pm, but will come back, and I can be pinged on discord from here with @dune
18:03 < minus> anyone interested in receiving info@ emails?
18:04 <@Dune> yeay spam
18:19 <@Dune> I can provide a personal email to redirect to, minus
18:20 < minus> that works (i can offer an @teeworlds.com email alternatively)
18:20 <@Dune> It's more convenient for me to get a redirection and forget about it :)
21:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Landil: what is eating all your time? :c
22:07 < Landil> some cute little buggers without guns :D
22:08 < Landil> and as a peon would say: work work
22:27 < bridge_> [freenode] <juanito> @randr()
22:27 < bridge_> [freenode] <juanito> i965: Failed to submit batchbuffer: Input/output error [5beb416d][chat]:  0: rand(): lets try something i965: Failed to submit batchbuffer: Input/output error
22:27 < bridge_> [freenode] <juanito> crashed
22:28 < rand> wow
22:29 <@Dune> rand: first time I see oy suggesting the 5 seconds delay on spec, should open an issue somewhere
22:40 < rand> I read "seperating spectators" :o
22:41 < guenstig_werben> heinrich5991 plz two way role in discord <3
22:41 <@Dune> that's related to your PR, not to the delay thing
22:41 <@heinrich5991> Dune: ^
22:41 <@Dune> ack
22:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> thanks
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> the rules at https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=rules/irc_rules apply
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> of course
22:42 < rand> Dune: not sure, I suspect he really wants to seperate spectator and player mechanisms
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> now we only need to get rid of the [quakenet] [teeworlds] prefixes
22:42 <@Dune> hmmm
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> what bot is doing the irclink thing?
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @guenstig werben we need to distinguish freenode
22:43 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> wait since when is tw on freenode
22:43 < rand> that would be nice while making modded server with more than 16 players harder to make
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I told you yesterday, remember?
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> besides, then we should have a #freenode and #quakenet channel
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> no, didnt hear that
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> thanks heinrich
22:43 < rand> join matrix, be nice, be free
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> besides, @Dune the problem with having one channel for both is, is it linked 3 ways?
22:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> the idea is to bridge quakenet with freenode and discord
22:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes
22:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> rand i have
22:44 < rand> what, also on freenode  ?
22:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> matrix
22:44 <@Dune> yes, we get messages from there sometimes
22:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> besides, dune it shoulnt matter where you're typing, they should just be connected
22:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> imo
22:45 <@Dune> e.g. that one at 10:27
22:45 < rand> ok, I'll stay here anyway
22:45 < rand> only reason to be on quakenet
22:46 <@Dune> I personally don't mind IRC, but a lot of contributors are only on discord nowadays so it's quite convenient :/
22:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> besides, who set up the roles in discord?
22:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> doesnt quite make sense to me
22:46 <@Dune> me in part
22:46 < rand> people said the same things with skype before
22:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> rather seperate admin / moderators and not "two way". imo i'd also prefer to have those channels as transparently linked as possible, so removing the two way barrier
22:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> but whatever
22:47 <@Dune> huh? two way people aren't moderators
22:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> i meant display seperatley
22:47 < rand> I prefer feeling superiority by being on irc
22:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> sorry
22:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> if you want to highlight someone who can chat, a slightly off grey could help (coloring the role)
22:48 <@Dune> rand: right :/ maybe it's the wrong move then, idk
22:48 < rand> no, I'm kidding
22:48 <@heinrich5991> guenstig werben: I see little reason to separate admins
22:48 <@heinrich5991> most freenode channels indeed don't do it
22:49 <@heinrich5991> I'm aware that it's different on quakenet
22:49 <@heinrich5991> (or moderators)
22:49 < rand> discord is fine as long as it fulfills its duty, make teeworlds great again!
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> 
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/512021130605756417/Bildschirmfoto_von_2018-11-13_22-49-03.png
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> this is strange
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> that's the only thing i'm saying
22:49 <@heinrich5991> k. sounded like you were saying more
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> and on discord mostly you'd seperate it because its built for larger online lists so in larger servers you'd see which moderators are online if you need them
22:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> thats basically the reasoning behind it
