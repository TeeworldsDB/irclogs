10:42 < Dune> Kottizen, minus: the domain name is still handled by matricks, right? getting sendgrid emails that the payment was declined and service will be interrupted (expired card?)
10:45 <@heinrich5991> it is handled by matricks AFAIK
10:46 <@heinrich5991> that seems bad. can anyone contact him?
10:53 < day> the teeworlds.com domain?
11:12 < minus> Dune: that's phishing mails
11:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> huh
11:36 < ChillerDragon> Why do I have the feeling that the winter theme is still enforced default
11:36 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L2562
11:37 < ChillerDragon> 0x0703 is default so a fresh tw install without prior config gets winter theme in fokin hottest summer
11:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> he is right
11:38 < ChillerDragon> i have cl_menu_theme "jungle" in my configs and yet everytime i burn my harddrive i get winter theme
13:42 < Dune> minus: ah whoops
13:42 < Dune> that's good news
13:42 < Dune> ChillerDragon: well 0.7.4 was in winter :D
