03:11 < juacom99> hi, i got a quick question, i set up a lan server and i see it twice in the server list one for ipv4 and the other for ipv6, any chance i can bind it only t ipv4?
03:11 < juacom99> *to
12:37 < dhkmnt> yo, anyone know if its possible to find that person which ddosed me.. or for real my company? its a teeworlds dude.
12:37 <@matricks> dhkmnt: well, it's kinda hard
12:38 < dhkmnt> hmm
12:38 <@matricks> you can get the ip numbers, but then it gets hard :)
12:38 <@minus> dhkmnt: inherently difficult with DDoS, since you don't get any direct connection from the attacker
12:38 <@matricks> even worse with drdos
12:38 < dhkmnt> but i know the guy and i could contact him
12:38 <@minus> well, DDoS is DRDos in most cases
12:39 <@matricks> dhkmnt: then do it
12:39 < dhkmnt> hm
12:39 < dhkmnt> i will
12:39 <@matricks> dunno what that will do however
12:39 < dhkmnt> he must learn that this is bad
12:39 <@minus> how old is he?
12:40 < dhkmnt> i dont know. but well, when it was only my home internet, ok. but he ddosed my company.
12:40 < dhkmnt> but for sure not over 18
12:40  * matricks is loosing faith in humanity
12:41 < dhkmnt> well
12:41 <@minus> well, DDoS attacks are a crime, you could get the police involved 
12:41 < dhkmnt> ok
12:42 < dhkmnt> i'll look - thank you anyway
12:42 <@matricks> also, don't copy that flopyy
12:42 < dhkmnt> you mean i should NOT ddos back?
12:43 <@matricks> reference to a very very old video ;)
12:44 <@matricks> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up863eQKGUI
12:45 < dhkmnt> hehe thank you
12:45 < heinrich5991> (I don't think the police will do anything, though)
12:46 <@minus> even if they don't, might scare him off though
12:47 <@matricks> give him a stern phone call
13:08 < dhkmnt> a stern phone call?
13:08 <@matricks> call and yell a bit at him
13:10 < dhkmnt> yell?
13:10 < dhkmnt> xd
13:11 <@matricks> yeah, the cops can call him and yell a bit at him
13:13 < dhkmnt> good idea
13:14 <@matricks> but you need some sort of evidence
13:22 < dhkmnt> i have a screenshot
13:22 < dhkmnt> and i know i should had make a demo
13:23 <@matricks> that is nowhere near sufficent
13:26 < heinrich5991> I wonder what would be sufficient though
13:26 < heinrich5991> the best thing I could manage to create would be packet dumps
13:28 < ghost91> yoyo
13:28 < ghost91> what's going on?
13:34 <@minus> hey ghost91
13:34 <@minus> working
13:45 <@matricks> w√∂rkin'
