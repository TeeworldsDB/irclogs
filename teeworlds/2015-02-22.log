10:15 < LittleWhite> At some point, two days ago, I said SDL 2 was not working on my Intel Atom (Aspire netbook). I was wrong. I retest it today and compiled it properly. It is working as supposed. Sorry for the wront info.
10:16 < LittleWhite> (even to me it sounded strange :p )
10:23 <@matricks> :)
10:24 < LittleWhite> Hello matricks \ o /
10:24 <@matricks> herro
10:24 <@matricks> I finished This War of Mine yesterday o/
10:26 < LittleWhite> well done :)
10:26 < LittleWhite> so you have time to code something now :p
10:26 <@matricks> I think I might yes
10:26 < LittleWhite> or find a new game to play with
10:27 <@matricks> I should do that as well
10:27  * rayv is still waiting for good open source MMORPG
10:27 <@matricks> rayv: I have ideas for that
10:27 <@matricks> or well, how to construct a MMORPG in a week
10:28 < rayv> How about maintaining such project? Renting servers might be troublesome
10:28 <@matricks> rayv: like I said, I have ideas ;)
10:29 <@matricks> the idea is to not require a lot of servers
10:31 < rayv> matricks: let me know when You will begin. Maybe I will be able to contribute
10:31 <@matricks> lol, probably never
10:31 < rayv> >.<
10:31 <@matricks> I have loads of ideas, and no time and energy for em
10:32 < LittleWhite> rayv: I can start, and you contribute. See :
10:32 < LittleWhite> int main(int argc, char** argv)
10:32 < LittleWhite> {
10:32 < LittleWhite> }
10:32 < rayv> LittleWhite: https://github.com/Rayvenden/SquareWars
10:32 < LittleWhite> Will try it ... just, i have to install Allegro
10:32 <@matricks> LittleWhite: and already produced a bug, nice going dude
10:33 < LittleWhite> return 0;
10:33 < LittleWhite> :D
10:34 < rayv> LittleWhite: It's just displaying black screen though. Branch 'newarray' has more functions, but code is chaotic
10:34 < rayv> I'm rewriting it in free time
10:34 < LittleWhite> ./game 
10:34 < LittleWhite> terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
10:34 < LittleWhite>   what():  basic_string::_S_construct null not valid
10:34 < LittleWhite> Abandon
10:35 < LittleWhite> comeon , no clean rule in makefile :'(
10:35 <@matricks> i've also wondered if I can make a game without coding :)
10:35 < rayv> LittleWhite: there's clean rule
10:36 < LittleWhite> not in newarray branch ... or I made something really wrong
10:36 < LittleWhite> matricks: Unity ? GameMaker ? Godot ?
10:36 <@matricks> just writing a specification
10:36 < LittleWhite> matricks: You have just to use your old board game :p
10:36 <@matricks> now, foods
10:38 < LittleWhite> rayv: I have played (newarray branch)
10:39 < LittleWhite> interactionSurface *** mobileObjs
10:39 < LittleWhite> Wow, so much stars :)
10:39 < rayv> "but code is chaotic"
10:39 < LittleWhite> totally :D
10:40 < LittleWhite> but it's working :)
10:41 < LittleWhite> On GitHub its written :  Any advice is welcome
10:42 < rayv> yeah. I'm kinda newbie in game writing
10:42 < LittleWhite> there is no problem with that :)
10:42 < LittleWhite> I never invent game, just reproduce existing ones
11:39 <@minus> matricks | LittleWhite: and already produced a bug, nice going dude ← actually return 0; isn't required in main
11:40 <@matricks> minus: but that doesn't make the joke funny!
11:41 <@minus> what joke
11:41 <@matricks> SWOOOSH!
11:51 < LittleWhite> minus: It will give you a warning / moreover, the error code can be important in script and other stuff checking the return code ;)
11:53 <@minus> it does not give you a warning, not in main
11:58 < LittleWhite> With -Wall, it does
12:01 <@minus> not for me
12:03 < LittleWhite> huh ?
12:03 < LittleWhite> which version ?
12:04 < LittleWhite> or which compiler
12:08 <@minus> g++ (GCC) 4.9.2 20150204 (prerelease)
12:11 < LittleWhite> I am still using 4.8.3, but ... I didn't know that they will fix such thing
12:11 < LittleWhite> to me, it was just normal to have the warning
12:45 <@minus> maybe because my main is empty
12:46 <@minus> LittleWhite: there's a warning for C, but not for C++
12:46 < LittleWhite> My main was also empty
12:46 < LittleWhite> Ah !
12:47 < LittleWhite> Right
22:09 < heinrich5991> matricks: main is fine without a return :) it is assumed to return 0 then
22:25 < LittleWhite> heinrich5991: In C++ only, no ?
22:26 < heinrich5991> C/C++ afaik
22:26 < LittleWhite> there is not a little stupid trick like this ? :D
22:26 < heinrich5991> but just for the main function
22:26 < LittleWhite> ok, because only the C compiler will give a warning, not the C++ one
22:52 < BotoX> does anyone here know too much about the valve source engine ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
22:53 < chsk> you?
22:53 < BotoX> not enough apparently
22:53 < chsk> o
22:54 < chsk> i only know too much about steam :<
22:54 < BotoX> Right now I have a problem that the client sometimes doesn't jump when the +jump event is registered
22:55 < BotoX> like, there is a variable in the C_BasePlayer that hold information about the events that have been fired this tick (afButtonPressed)
22:55 < BotoX> And most of the time the event gets executed in the same tick
22:56 < BotoX> so that m_fFlags & FL_ONGROUND == false -> aka. client is in the air
22:56 < BotoX> but sometimes (10-20%?) it takes a tick a longer for m_fFlags to indicate that the client is in the air
22:56 < chsk> are you seriously a writing bhopping script? :v
22:56 < BotoX> I already did long ago
22:57 < BotoX> it calculates the bhop performance clientside that all anti cheat systems use to detect bhop hacks
22:57 < BotoX> and caps itself to not trigger a detection
22:57 < chsk> thank god for csgo's stamina.
22:58 < BotoX> but for that to work 100% accurate I need to know how long the player took to jump off again after landing
22:59 < BotoX> and if a jump sometimes takes 1 tick instead of 0 I can't do that :x
23:00 < BotoX> Though, I could maybe simply check if a +jump event has been sent, instead of checking if the player is in the air. And then just confirm it by checking if the player actually is in the air in the next tick
23:03 < BotoX> And damn I just discovered how great HexRays decompiler is
