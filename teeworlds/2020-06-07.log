14:03 < ZillyHuhn> Maybe @Dune
14:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> mmh
14:04 < ZillyHuhn> isnt it urs?
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> probably
14:05 < ZillyHuhn> Also why is this even there? Is it for design? To have some sort of padding at the left?
14:05 < ZillyHuhn> Or does it have to be there for default reasons
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/3cf1917791c24343a0c4ce41877beb5f0a5ed2c9
14:05 < ZillyHuhn> yes ik
14:05 < ZillyHuhn> thats why i asked u
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there's probably some padding at the left
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's been a year and a half though, sorry
14:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I mean it used to be "87", you can think of it as "70" if it helps :D
14:08 < ZillyHuhn> hmk
14:08 < ZillyHuhn> I am working on something similar in menus_demo but mine is hoverable any idea why that is
14:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what is hoverable?
14:08 < ZillyHuhn> like the empty field " " begins to shine when i mouse over
14:09 < ZillyHuhn> i expected the -1 to magically take care of that
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hard to say
14:10 < ZillyHuhn> k ill poke around
14:15 < ZillyHuhn> found it in case one cares :D https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/66145d49335adfbae3114d7a5df593678e06f513/src/game/client/components/menus_browser.cpp#L1078
