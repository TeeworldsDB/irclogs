08:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @Dune check out Github actions for deployment. Assa and me did some playing around, might help looking at Assa's and my mod projects, I didn't build any clients, tho.
09:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @jxsl13 that's cool but I'm not in charge of that stuff, I'm the wrong person to talk to here
13:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> mean
13:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I meqn your Gamer client repository.
13:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah, well thanks, I don't think it's worthwhile to set up github stuff for that small repo though :)
13:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I dev there in bursts and release shortly after anyway
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> >:O we need the instant deployment, I need it xD
18:30 < Dune> o/
18:30 < Oy> \o
18:30 < Dune> forwarding kma's thanks
18:31 < Oy> cool, thx :D
18:31 < Oy> haven't seen u a while kma :)
19:02 < kma> o/
19:36 < minus> oh hey it's matricks
19:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ðŸ˜® a wild matricks appeared?
19:53 < matricks> so wild, very matricks
20:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ;0
20:38 < Dune> Any thoughts on scriptz/tools/features for 0.6 skins? 
20:38 < Dune> Its mentioned in the issur that a tool would be preferred
20:38 < Dune> Not sure how one would do that without a lib tho
20:40 < Oy> well a tool wouldn't work accurate, changed too much in 0.7
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Yeah you'd need to upscale the image
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> secondary file format for easy sharing of skins.
20:44 < Oy> dunno how a skin created with such a tool would work with colours
20:45 < Dune> 0.6 skins are made for one color scheme 
20:45 < Dune> I'd be fine with being limited to that
20:46 < Oy> u mean no custom colours?
20:47 < Oy> how about team colours?
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe an xml + svg hybrid with dedicated xml sections for every body part. might be easier to copy and paste stuff into sich a file format. the xml can also contain the json data that's currently being used.
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Yeah converting 0.6 skins would make them look bad in a number of situations, but it is better than nothing.
