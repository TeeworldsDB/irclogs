00:00 <@Dune> well c++ lambdas... yeah. at least the notation isn't fantastically readable
00:00 <@Dune> it sounds cool when you have to write it, less so when you have to read it
00:19 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> ok new information
00:19 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> when the grappling hook drops there seems to be a residual effect after
00:19 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> like, drop + spike at near same time, and then spike spike spike
00:22 <@Dune> Wifi?
00:22 <@Dune> Happens on several servers ?
00:24 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> haven't tried multiple servers but dedicated land line
00:24 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> nothing else (should) be happening on network, no torrents, no streaming, tec
00:24 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> *etc
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is the maps submodule up to date in the tw master ?
00:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> No change afaik?
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> JewZeus: strange:/
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> june was a change by sonix
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the hashed seem to be different
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hashes
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Eh but we can't do that with the hashchecker
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I mean git hashes ._.
00:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Ik
00:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> of tw master submodule and latest hash of tw-maps repository
00:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I don't understand what you want to say ._.
01:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> man, one can actually go back when completing nicknames..
01:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nobody never knew
01:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> most likely
01:54 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> day: are you still interested in helping to moderate the ctf server? o.O
02:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what's the goto sorting algorithm?
02:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> for a c array
02:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> of structs that implement operator<
05:55 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> I think, if I had to guess, this grappling hook thing is related to other people grappling at a time?
05:55 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> that seems to be what's correlated
09:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> JewZeus: not sure what you mean
09:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 you've committed to teeworlds beforeâ€¦ the PR has broken whitespace, doesn't adhere to the style (braces, variable naming, allocations) ðŸ˜¦
13:18 < Dune> merry shortest-day-on-earth
13:29 < Dune> I think we're done with the issues? just the open PRs left :)
13:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @heinrich5991  what kind of naming scheme should I use for array<cgvjbh>, there seem to be different ones used throughout the code
13:31 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2331 has a todo black globe?
13:31 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2305 has 3 todo's
13:33 < Dune> ah yeah, well a reverse-colored version would be nice for better hover effects @Sonix
13:35 < Dune> the todos on 2305 are just open discussions, that is I suggest this layout but we could add death bars, move the grabs column, change the width of the bar
13:35 < Dune> I'm fine with things as is
13:36 < Dune> need to review and smoothen things out now
13:37 < Dune> rip https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2242 tho
13:37 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2331#issuecomment-568258356 oh thanks :)
13:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> np ðŸ™‚
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> why is the RACE.png caps :/
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/658293152347717653/unknown.png
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is it to tell that its not standard?
14:03 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2319 dunno about the icon
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> move it to lowercase
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> k
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i assumed it has some meaning
14:05 < Oy> no
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Oy: yeah the icon isn't great. Maybe @Sonix feels like making one
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix *
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/658294942313218098/unknown.png
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hue? i did not touch race_flag what happend there?
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> your computer automatically optimized the file to take up less space
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yikes
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._. not
14:10 < Oy> hm
14:10 < Oy> hope it doesn't mess with the alphas
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> happend on Sonix change already
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i first thought he deleted the file and then i was suprised its still there
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it will shrink on every contribution until it disapears xxxxxxxxxD
14:11 < Oy> ?
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/9a346e9b0d0348f6aa532cad955b05d8be1e8925
14:13 < Oy> yeah,  replaced the race_flag with that flag too, probably just adds one entry for both
14:15 < Oy> Dune: should remove that old extend button in the browser :P
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah yikes merge to early xd
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Oy: ooh i forgot
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what the heck it worked fine locally for me
14:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah i messed up the force push omg
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> translations over
14:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what a mess :/ Oy pls wait for ci to finish before merge.
14:24 < Oy> works
14:26 < Dune> I'll try to rewrite a bit the stats UI code (with no visible changes), it gets messy and difficult to change
14:26 < Dune> but that can wait a bit
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ci rips ._.
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im on it :/
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm getting git detached state errors
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what the heck CI, I bet the only build that's gonna work is the windows one, even tho I'm not on windows
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/658300618393518080/Bildschirmfoto_2019-12-22_um_14.31.27.png
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> travis-ci ._.
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it did work like 8 hours ago
14:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._. ok, it's everything due to data not containing assets. because assets are crucial for builds
14:36 < Dune> if https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2331 does not make it to 0.7.4, then there should at least be a space between CallVote and Browser
14:43 < Dune> Updated the browser icon: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2331/commits/6d0782a592e05dd16fc1525adf37927afb00767d
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the ingame browser of Santee looks kinda different from what's seemingly the ingame browser :/
14:43 < Dune> I suggest to cherry-pick 22541c3 and 6d0782a
14:49 < Dune> guess I'll just change the PR
14:55 < Dune> @jxsl13 only the icon should differ :)
14:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://teeworlds.com/?page=journal&id=13348 :c santee screenshot
14:58 < Dune> hmm?
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yikes ci was still broken
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im confused how mac can fail while linux works
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I mean the server details stuff look completely different
14:58 < Dune> linux uses bam probably?
14:59 < Dune> @jxsl13 click the little arrow ;)
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nah
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> linux also uses cmake
14:59 < Dune> cmake needs to list race_flag.png or race.png most likely
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> both listed
14:59 < Dune> or it's not in the alphabetical order ><
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and working fine on my linux
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it also is sorted LC_ALL=C
14:59 < Dune> cmake doesn't even give a warning what file is the problem...
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> for me locally it does
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but there is no error xd
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i guess i will test it when i get my fingers on a mac again
15:00 < Oy> ci successful
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wat?
15:00 < Dune> oh
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> travis said it failed or did i read wrong?
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> oh goodness, until I found the arrow
15:01 < Oy> was mentioning ci
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea circle works
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but how can travis fail then :/
15:01 < Dune> travis passed too
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> woot
15:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah i see
15:02 < Oy> travis probably worked with an old repo in ur pr
15:02 < Oy> didn't update
15:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ok cool
15:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> didn't the glob stuff usually tell, what files are unexpectedly there?
15:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
15:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> now it doesn't ._.
15:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> http://149.202.127.134:8080/Mc
15:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ™‚
15:04 < Dune> a script to generate a script to generate a script to build teeworlds :D
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ikr xd
15:04 < Oy> Dune: good work with the dev journal <3
15:05 < Dune> thanks <3
15:43 < Dune> Any issue with ryozuki's pr btw?
15:44 < Dune> Should run a modded server to test
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> gib custom server side commands pls
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ðŸ˜„
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> ðŸ˜®
16:00 < Oy> looks good
16:01 < Oy> some cleanup and localization could be useful, but could be done after release
16:04 < Dune> start a new branch? :p
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> would be nice to have a usage exampl
16:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I guess if he default commands would be sent, it would be a nice exampe, but I guess Ryozuki decided against that.
16:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the*
16:07 < Dune> Not a good idea to rely on the server for that 
16:08 < Dune> Modders gotta know how to read network.py :p or write up something 
16:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> i wanted to add a server-side command on vanilla to show how it works, but i dont know any good
16:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> and current commands dont need server interaction
16:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> stuff like whisper needs to be explicitly supported by the server for example
16:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but not the other client side only stuff
16:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> guess whisper/w is the only command that might make sense to be used as example. but yeah ._. poor people modding or starting to mod
16:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> well not like this changes the difficulty
16:12 < Dune> doesn't make sense to add stuff to the protocol just to give examples. If you really mind, write up a tutorial
16:12 < Oy> Dune: that icon overlapping looks odd http://www.solidfiles.com/v/VBAgDXq6n3vBR
16:13 < Dune> overlapping, Oy?
16:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> didn't intend to change the protocol, but yeah, I guess the proper way would be over the protocol to do the whisper support part. first thought was to simply send that command add message with whisper in it
16:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> without touching the protocol
16:14 < Dune> lots of braces style from Ryozuki's PR need to be fixed
16:14 < Oy> Dune: the extend icon box and the shadow above settings
16:14 < Oy> yeah
16:15 < Dune> ah
16:15 < Oy> and duplicate code server/client could be moved to seperate file
16:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does anyone have some dunno, clan-format or astyle? files for tw, would make sense to push them to master
16:15 < Dune> well that icon doesn't have to be shown ingame imo Oy
16:15 < Dune> would remove it
16:16 < Oy> Dune:  that's not ingame in the pic :P
16:16 < Dune> ah
16:16 < Dune> right
16:17 < Dune> don't display in settings then? :/
16:19 < Oy> or move it a bit to the left so shadow and box have the same edge
16:23 < Dune> hm, eats up quite some space to do that
16:28 < Dune> reviewing translations
16:29 < Oy> really? looks like an additional third of the space that is there already between extend and quit box
16:29 < Oy> ok
16:29 < Oy> u look for that space? :P
16:29 < Oy> and check that nobody put ads in there
16:31 < Dune> some bad spacing here and there
16:33 < Dune> we will change that spaced string anyway so i don't fix it on transifex but locally
16:36 < Dune> lots of chinese stuff
16:40 < Oy> or move the extend box below quit?
16:41 < Dune> sounds ugly
16:41 < Dune> i'll try to increase the space on the sides
16:42 < Dune> not sure if the rectangle/square should be full
16:42 < Dune> on my OS it's not
16:47 < Dune> pushed languages, they should be fine
16:51 < Dune> ah, forgot to compile so it didn't copy the strings
16:52 < Dune> one bad string left
16:58 < Dune> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/8fed2f22d62ebe0327c821f0e8302306/screenshot_2019-12-22_16-57-36.png
16:59 < Dune> Oy: it's only bad with 4:3, so I think I need to add a `max(` in the calculation
17:00 < Oy> all except 16:9 overlap right?
17:01 < Dune> probably
17:02 < Dune> I have some strange stuff with translations
17:02 < Dune> https://pastebin.com/tfpncBsT
17:02 < Dune> Play is being displayed as "Lire" in the starts menus
17:02 < Dune> (which is bad)
17:07 < Oy> hm
17:10 < Oy> did it work in 0.7.3?
17:10 < Dune> the translation didn't change
17:10 < Dune> i think it did 
17:11 < Oy> there was an update to the json parser, maybe that broke it
17:11 < Dune> 0.7.3 loading is so slow :D
17:12 < Dune> yep 073 works
17:12 < Dune> 074 doesn't
17:12 < Oy> don't think we touched the localization stuff beside that
17:12 < Dune> yeah we didn't
17:13 < Dune> well that's annoying
17:13 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/733d077bf5aca6a0589e225a92de75f931743cdc
17:13 < Oy> was in 0.7.3
17:13 < Oy> so hm
17:14 < Dune> ooh
17:16 < Dune> maybe it ignores context somehow now?
17:17 < Dune> if(rStr.m_ContextHash == ContextHash) return rStr.m_Replacement; else if(rStr.m_ContextHash == DefaultHash) DefaultIndex = i;
17:17 < Dune> looks fine (src/game/client/localization.cpp)
17:20 < Oy> probably some sideeffect
17:21 < Oy> could go back every commit and se which broke it
17:21 < Dune> I'm doing some debugging
17:26 < Dune> Okay so it seems like the localizer defaults to the first string it sees when it's an empty context :/
17:27 < Dune> ah wait no, it doesn't return
17:29 < Dune> Okay, so it seems rather like the no-context string is erased by the context string and lost in the database
17:29 < Dune> [2019-12-22 17:28:31][locale]: localizing pStr=Play context=[2019-12-22 17:28:31][locale]: Context hash == 5381, Default hash == 5381[2019-12-22 17:28:31][locale]: rStr.m_Replacement = Lire
17:41 < Dune> The problem is there: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/fd97717a37db63ce76fcd4a1b77d8061d38bc2da/src/game/client/localization.h#L18-L21
17:42 < Dune> when this is called: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/fd97717a37db63ce76fcd4a1b77d8061d38bc2da/src/game/client/localization.cpp#L46 it erases previous entries
17:46 < Oy> redix: around?
17:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Yep
17:47 < Dune> Oy: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2337
17:47 < redix> Oy: ^
17:47 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/d86d576217eeb843c822568f6b8f97ac852ac0d7#diff-a53e0bf8bcb06917c9a41252f095fd3eL73 needed?
17:48 < Oy> oh
17:48 < redix> Well... Without it's not a binary search at all 
17:48 < Oy> that change i linked broke it
17:48 < redix> Yeah probably
17:48 < Dune> Yeah
17:49 < redix> Didn't think about the context thing... Everything seemed to work
17:49 < Dune> not sure if operator< is used elsewhere
17:49 < Dune> might be safer to revert redix's change and apply #2337 after release
17:51 < redix> Just use linear search for the localization
17:51 < redix> Reverting this commit would require reverting a lot more stuff
17:52 < Dune> I mean, revert this specific line :)
17:52 < Dune> linear search is safe with that operator< ?
17:52 < redix> It basically was linear search before aswell
17:52 < Dune> might wanna add a big fat warning about not using another search there
17:53 < redix> Making binary search use linear partition again will make the snapshot code a lot slower
17:53 < Oy> i guess using Dunes pr is fine
17:53 < Oy> operator < wasn't specific before
17:53 < Dune> in comment
17:55 < redix> Yeah that looks good
17:58 < Dune> https://i.imgur.com/QIaYxVg.png
17:58 < Dune> making the wide screen *less wide* than the normal screen is not a good idea
17:59 < Dune> wrong link
17:59 < Dune> ah, right link :)
18:01 < Oy> yeah
18:02 < Oy> maybe just go with the overlap and figure out sth better later :)
18:03 < Dune> or -                               if(DoButton_MenuTabTop(&s_WideButton, g_Config.m_UiWideview ? "\xe2\x96\xaa" : "\xe2\x96\xac", false, &Button, 1.0f, 1.0f, CUI::CORNER_B)) +                               if((m_MenuPage == PAGE_INTERNET || m_MenuPage == PAGE_LAN || m_MenuPage == PAGE_DEMOS) && DoButton_MenuTabTop(...
18:03 < Dune> works fine too
18:06 < Oy> kinda odd that's it's just in these menus, but yeah that does it for now
18:06 < Dune> we can just move it to a checkbox in general if it's trouble
18:06 < Dune> that needs a locale tho :p
18:07 < Dune> pushed that fix
18:08 < Dune> need to update russian and we're good
18:09 < Oy> statboard?
18:09 < Dune> ah yeah that too :)
18:11 < Oy> is it ready?
18:11 < Dune> I hadn't fixed russian yet 
18:11 < Dune> (there was a second fix)
18:11 < Dune> the statboard is ready
18:12 < Oy> oh
18:12 < Dune> code gets a bit spaghetti because of all the exceptions, there should be a proper array
18:21 < Oy> grr have to make a changelog
18:21 < Dune> think I have one around
18:22 < Dune> Well it needs some updates
18:22 < Dune> don't I usually write that?
18:25 < Oy> yeah, u should do that :D
18:25 < Dune> versionsrv needs minus?
18:25 < Oy> hm, didn't think about the new skins and santa hats
18:25 < Oy> yeah
18:26 < Dune> they seem alright
18:27 < Dune> I used them for the santee journal entries
18:29 < Dune> translations should be final
18:33 < Oy> ok
18:35 < Dune> with github build actions we could actually generate a number of screenshots that would be very hepful for translation checking :)
18:35 < Dune> ah, maybe there is no gpu
18:38 < Dune> > hey, can you explain the server sided chat commands feature a bit? I want to update my modsnetwork.py could use a comment, rn it looks like it's race stuff
18:41 < Dune> should make a dev journal entry on that one
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> So we've decided to keep the "extend" button?
18:41 < Dune> for the server browser only
18:41 < Dune> we can move that to a checkbox in General after release I guess
18:42 < Dune> unless someone has a better idea :)
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> What is the reason for making the change an option?
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> instead of forcing it
18:42 < Dune> some people prefer the modern small view
18:43 < Dune> would be simpler if everyone had the same tastes :D
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> that seems unnecessary to me
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> extended looks better, the Santee screenshot feels usability-wise worse :c just my feels
18:44 < Dune> "why aren't my tastes default" is a common complaint :p
18:45 < Dune> I agree though, @jxsl13
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @jxsl13 nothing changed except the extended mode I believe
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> (bridge died)
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @LordSk correct
18:49 < Oy> some prefer to see more of the background map
18:49 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> Dune, the "correlated to other people grappling" thing? I noticed that when I tend to fall off grappling hooks is when other people are also grappling, if it's a crowded server with 6-8 other grapples going I tend to not even see the grappling hook fully extend, it kind of pokes out a bit and doesn't go all the way out
18:49 < Dune> sonix for one
18:50 < Dune> JewZeus: I guess you gotta try with other servers
18:50 < Dune> looking into dimming the statboard colors
18:51 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> Dune, consistent experience across servers at this point :P
18:51 < Dune> okay :/
18:51 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> again, not all the time, I've learned to swing around ok, but every time I try in a game? *splat*
18:52 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> kinda not fun to learn to play one game but have to play another :P
18:52 < Dune> play another? when is it fine?
18:53 < Oy> oh, then i don't have to upload releases yet :D
18:53 < Dune> ah, you built them?
18:53 < Oy> was about to start
18:53 < Dune> it should take a short while
18:53 < Dune> version number should change though
18:53 < Oy> created the 0.7.4 draft
18:54 < Dune> oh I missed that :)
18:54 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> dune, works fine when in an empty server
18:54 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> works fine in a small game, 2-3 people
18:54 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> works sometimes in a bigger game
18:54 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> but the bigger the game, the more I rocket jump instead
18:54 < Dune> https://i.imgur.com/BtQj8mE.png
18:54 < Dune> oy: fine?
18:54 < Oy> Dune: yeah
18:55 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> ctrl shift d g thing?
18:55 < Dune> sounds like some awful network issue, JewZeus :(
18:55 < Dune> somehow Teeworlds is sensitive to it?
18:56 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> hmm
18:58 < minus> Dune: dunno, i *think* it runs on teeworlds.com and heinrich5991 has access to that
19:05 < Dune> well I have to set up my old linux docker to build teeworlds there
19:05 < Dune> changed pc since
19:11 < Oy> Dune: u gonna change the statboard colours?
19:11 < Dune> it's done
19:12 < Oy> pr?
19:13 < Dune> I'm testing
19:14 < Dune> done testing
19:14 < minus> could just link teeworlds statically against musl
19:14 < Dune> but noted a header width bug in non-team game modes (like the flag capture column is still there)
19:14 < Dune> investigating a bit
19:15 < minus> how about just not providing linux binaries
19:15 < minus> distro repositories do exist
19:15 < Dune> what is user-friendliness? :D
19:15 < Dune> distro repositories tend to be outdated
19:15 < Dune> see https://repology.org/project/teeworlds/versions
19:17 < minus> pretty much all of the current versions of the respective distros have 0.7
19:17 < Dune> what about 0.7.4
19:18 < minus> that's not released?
19:18 < Dune> 0.7.3 then
19:18 < Dune> my ubuntu doesn't even have 0.7
19:18 < Oy> 0.7.3 was released in april
19:18 < minus> ubuntu 19.10 should have had it then
19:18 < Dune> damn this header bug
19:18 < minus> probably no one notified the maintainer
19:19 < Oy> could be yeah
19:19 < Oy> Dune: what header bug?
19:20 < Dune> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/e635e38b0afac18221cbf2a63945df4d/screenshot_2019-12-22_19-19-55.png
19:20 < Dune> there is room for the flags column, but this is DM
19:20 < Oy> oh
19:21 < Dune> ah it's a flag grab issues
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what is the purpose of those two tees at the right side?
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> looks like a dm game
19:22 < Dune> it is!
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm
19:24 < Dune> Oy: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2339/
19:24 < Dune> oops need to check against the flags flag :)
19:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> dont rush things guyz
19:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> ðŸ™‚
19:27 < Dune> Well, even when the release draft is ready, there are some write ups to do and thus some time to test things out
19:27 < Oy> and then there's 0.7.4.1 :D
19:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> lol
19:29 < Dune> or tag sliding! the debian guys love it
19:29 < Oy> :D
19:32 < Dune> should be good
19:32 < Dune> I'm not very happy with how long "Suicides" is but well
19:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> "Self" for self kills?
19:34 < Dune> sounds good but translations are sometimes even longer anyway
19:35 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/0103d0b8949ff7718b0e8ff75c78309b6e6d7443/src/game/client/components/stats.cpp#L215 should probably use a smaller font than 24
19:36 < Dune> https://imgur.com/a/yIvggGA
19:40 < Dune> all good, working on docker
19:44 < Dune> I'll build with bam, tell me if you prefer a cmake build
19:48 < Oy> building with bam too
20:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> do cmake!
20:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> we love cmake, vs code loves cmake nowadays too ðŸ˜®
20:07 < Oy> Dune: highlight me if u need sth :)
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> sure
20:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Ah osx done
20:49 < Dune> reminder to release teeworlds sources for package managers (with maps & languages)
20:50 < Oy> already in the github draft :P
20:51 < Dune> oh :p
20:52 < Dune> uploading
20:52 < Oy> will be out soon, just go ahead then :)
20:53 < Dune> pop out the baby? :)
20:53 < Dune> see you tomorrow for 0.7.4.1? :)
20:57 < rand> *heavy breathing*
20:57 < Dune> ahh hold on, there's steam :/
20:57 < Dune> never built for steam on linux
20:57 < Ryozuki> steam also has linux
20:58 < rand> but packaging is specific
20:58 < Ryozuki> i mean it has a linux package too :o
20:59 < Dune> my workflow is on my windows pc though
20:59 < Dune> heinrich5991: what's your business status?
21:01 < Dune> I'm not even sure I can package for steam on linux
21:09 < Dune> looks like I can
21:31 < Dune> minus: remember if there is any way to embed youtube on the frontpage? or if the trailer is hardcoded in 
21:32 < minus> trailer is html
21:33 < Dune> ah rip
21:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> trailer is youtube too, just embedded via <iframe>
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> gotta edit directly the .html file either way
21:38 < Dune> yeah that'd be a dirty hardcode
22:47 <@heinrich5991> Dune: online now
22:47 <@heinrich5991> you're good though?
22:48 < Dune> heinrich5991: cool
22:49 < Dune> heinrich5991: trying to send things to steam but it's painful to try to remake everything
22:49 < Dune> also, teeworlds.com doesn't like youtube but I imagine I'll have to work around this with a [url][img]?
22:50 <@heinrich5991> ohh
22:50 <@heinrich5991> you mean the blog?
22:50 < Dune> more like the news ;)
22:50 < Dune> but yeah same deal
22:50 < Dune> irc or discord?
22:51 <@heinrich5991> d/c
22:51 <@heinrich5991> "dont care"
