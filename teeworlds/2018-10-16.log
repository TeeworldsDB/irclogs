13:26 < Dune_> hey heinrich5991 
13:27 < Dune_> I'm thinking of forking some of the recent posts in a "post here your reports of bugs/issues" topic
13:27 < Dune_> since there's going to be a bunch of them
13:27 < Dune_> but ofc ideally they should rather be on github
13:28 < Dune_> might still be better than have them in the release announcement idk
13:51 < Kottizen> minus: I'm here now
14:02 <@heinrich5991> Dune: maybe just keep them in the release topic, otherwise they'll probably get lost
14:03 < Dune_> alright, you're right
14:48 <@heinrich5991> hmm. oy's not here :/
14:57 < minus> Kottizen: that's a very late reply :D
14:57 < minus> Kottizen: will you still be here in 4-5h?
14:57 < minus> Kottizen: i kinda need a snapshot of the teeworlds VM
17:25 < Sonix-> hi
20:20 < rand> o/
20:53 < closeR_Kidahh> elo guys 
20:53 < closeR_Kidahh> is 7.0 out yet 
20:53 < Dune> 0.7, yes
20:53 < closeR_Kidahh> how tf do i update 
20:53 < closeR_Kidahh> i go on the main website only updates i see is for 6.5
20:53 < closeR_Kidahh> \which im sure i already have
20:54 < Dune> closeR_Kidahh:  use https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/releases
20:55 < closeR_Kidahh> thank you man <3
20:55 < closeR_Kidahh> do i del my current tw or just leave it and it will update automatically 
20:55 < Dune> heinrich5991: are we waiting for someone to put the links in the website/forum? it's complicated for many
20:55 < Dune> closeR_Kidahh: teeworlds are separate installs
20:55 < Dune> you can have both at once
20:55 < Dune> only your configuration (name, ...) is global
20:55 < closeR_Kidahh> man i fukcing love tw
20:56 < closeR_Kidahh> you guys doing alright?
20:57  * closeR_Kidahh slaps Dune around a bit with a large fishbot
20:57 < Dune> having a lot of slow days I guess :)
21:21 < rand> ctf score is 100x #captures, should it be also 1 point for grab at base ?
21:21 < Dune> isn't it already?
21:22 < rand> not in 0.7, at least no on my test server
21:23 < rand> weird
21:23 < Dune> huh
21:23 < Dune> it was the case in 0.6 right
21:23 < Dune> i'm not crazy
21:24 < rand> you're note
21:24 < rand> -e
21:25 < rand> and the source says +1 when grabing from baseâ€¦
21:25 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues
21:26 < Dune> sounds like an opportunity to open one? :)
21:26 < closeR_Kidahh> yo guys 
21:26 < closeR_Kidahh> is 7.0 just not used by anyone or is that just me 
21:27 < rand> oh, found
21:27 < Dune> given that the downloads are a bit hidden and that it was released yesterday, probably not many people yet closeR_Kidahh
21:27 < closeR_Kidahh> ah thank 
21:27 < closeR_Kidahh> s*
21:27 < closeR_Kidahh> just asking since i just found out about it today 
21:27 < closeR_Kidahh> the new update looks pretty cool
21:28 < closeR_Kidahh> im gonna miss the old layout 
21:28 < Dune> I think likewise!
21:30 < closeR_Kidahh> the new tee's are pretty cool though 
21:30 < closeR_Kidahh> im just praying old school blmap comes back like v2 v3 and v5 
21:30 < closeR_Kidahh> and lazer zcatch
21:36 <@heinrich5991> Dune: we're missing binaries for macos and linux 32bit :/
21:36 <@heinrich5991> (apart from that the release felt pretty rushed in the end, but I guess it's okay. there are a couple of annoying issues)
21:37 <@heinrich5991> I guess I could try to port the CMakeLists.txt from 0.6 to 0.7, then I could cross-compile it to windows/macos
21:39 < closeR_Kidahh> tw was quite decent on linux for me 
21:42 < Dune> heinrich5991: at least put download links for the rest?
21:43 <@heinrich5991> I'd at least like to have macos version ready, I think
21:43 < Dune> right
21:43 <@heinrich5991> linux 32bit is sufficiently niche
21:43 < Dune> :/
21:44 < Dune> I don't understand why the release news if we don't even have the binaries :/
21:45 <@heinrich5991> I think it was a bit rushed because he promised to "release it this weekend"
21:45 < Dune> I see
21:45 <@heinrich5991> it also contains a couple of annoying bugs that would probably be found by a bit of testing
21:46 < Dune> seems like it, yes
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> if it only was just a "couple" ðŸ˜›
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> It seems like the game crashes if u try to look at the scoreboard while in spec
21:54 <@heinrich5991> :(
21:54 <@heinrich5991> but it seems oy's at least active right now, PRs getting merge
21:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> And i also noticed that the server loads the maps from roaming folder
21:55 <@heinrich5991> that's normal
21:55 <@heinrich5991> (always been the case)
21:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> is it?
21:56 <@heinrich5991> yes, I think so
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i had an older sur1 version in roaming, and the newest in  data/maps (where the game is)
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> it kept loading the wrong one, till I realized ðŸ˜¦
21:59 <@heinrich5991> teeworlds prefers appdata over the stuff lying next to the executable
22:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> probably couldn't notice because there was never a map compatibility break (tileset)
22:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> couldn't notice before*
22:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> now if u keep appdata with 0.6 maps you might notice some differences
22:03 < rand> reorder add_path in storage.cfg might help
22:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> its not a big deal anyway tho
22:04 <@heinrich5991> well, it's kinda intended
22:05 <@heinrich5991> that way, you can replace the game's files with your own, and it survives updates
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oy: heinrich5991: i have a macOS build if you need one i uploaded it to the issue https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1524
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i have no idea how to creat an actual macOS app with icon and stuff but this is a fully working binary that could be atleast be released on github for the mac users that really want to see 0.7 now
23:32 < Dune> Sonix: yeah, it was always in the roaming folder
