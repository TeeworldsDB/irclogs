00:00 <@Dune_> Merry christmas :D
00:00 <@Dune_> heinrich5991: we have a release announement, but I dind't draft it in steam
00:01 <@Dune_> the start page is a simple $ variablke
00:01 <@heinrich5991> yes, changed that already
00:01 <@heinrich5991> maybe we should put out the release announcement
00:01 <@heinrich5991> or I revert that
00:02 < Oy> hm about the win32 version
00:02 <@heinrich5991> Dune_: would you try the test branch of steam teeworlds?
00:03 < Oy> i get "running on windows-win64-unknown"
00:03 <@heinrich5991> hmmmm
00:03 < Oy> "unknown endianess"
00:03 < Oy> on startup
00:03 < Oy> it starts but thats odd
00:03 < Oy> dunno if it'll have some problem
00:03 <@heinrich5991> I reverted to 0.7.1 on the start page for now
00:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah bam was having issues detecting the arch
00:04 < Oy> hm
00:04 < Oy> did u use msvc?
00:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah
00:04 < Oy> that's how i build too
00:05 < Oy> u used the x86 native tool command prompt?
00:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yes
00:05 < Oy> provide by msvc
00:05 <@heinrich5991> undetected endian defaults to little endian (the right one)
00:05 < Oy> yeah but win64
00:06 < Oy> hope there's no internal mixup
00:06 <@heinrich5991> $ file teeworlds-0.7.2-win*/teeworlds.exe
00:06 <@heinrich5991> teeworlds-0.7.2-win32/teeworlds.exe: PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
00:06 <@heinrich5991> teeworlds-0.7.2-win64/teeworlds.exe: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows
00:06 <@heinrich5991> looks good
00:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> that's why I'd prefer if you did it instead
00:07 <@heinrich5991> you could rebuild if you want, oy
00:07 < Oy> then u would have to replace it again
00:07 < Oy> it seems to work
00:08 <@heinrich5991> idc
00:08 <@heinrich5991> steam and teeworlds.com would be quick to update, provided I get the builds somewhere
00:08 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] LordSk closed pull request #1927: Default inp_grab to 1 to be consistent with previous 0.7 releases (master...fix/inp_grab_default) https://git.io/fhUgy
00:09 < Oy> ok, few min
00:17 < Oy> heinrich5991: updated on github
00:17 <@heinrich5991> win32 and win64?
00:17 < Oy> no just win32
00:17 < Oy> win64 too?
00:18 <@heinrich5991> I guess it's fine
00:18 < Oy> ok
00:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> win64 is static then?
00:20 <@heinrich5991> yes
00:21 <@heinrich5991> Dune_: could you test the steam build?
00:23 <@Dune_> heinrich5991: I can't test anything steam rn
00:23 <@heinrich5991> ok
00:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> heinrich5991 which branch?
00:24 <@heinrich5991> "test", password "testtesttest"
00:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> works fine on my end
00:26 <@heinrich5991> nice. os? windows?
00:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> win10 x64
00:26 < Oy> anyone else ever had a crash with 0.7 https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1923 ?
00:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Oy: yeah I think so
00:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> was tabbed out, came back 5 min later
00:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> teeworlds was gone
00:28 < Oy> no error message?
00:28 <@heinrich5991> linux works, too
00:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> none
00:28 < Oy> ok, odd
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I never experienced it again tho
00:29 < Oy> ok
00:29 <@heinrich5991> anyone online to test the teeworlds steam version on mac?
00:30 <@heinrich5991> if not, I guess I'll just trust that I didn't fuck something up
00:30 <@heinrich5991> it worked the previous times (famous last words)
00:30 < Oy> haha :D
00:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ðŸ˜„
00:31 < Oy> don't think there's steam on the mac i build on
00:31 < Oy> and it already takes ages to build
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> So whats left?
00:32 <@heinrich5991> theoretically testing mac, but I don't think we have anyone who could do that
00:32 <@heinrich5991> so I guess steam and teeworlds.com downloads are ready
00:32 <@heinrich5991> push the red button with the announcement? :)
00:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @Dune did you change the inp_grab thing in the news post?
00:37 <@heinrich5991> Dune_: what's left for release? do you want to make the release post public?
00:37 <@Dune_> yeah
00:37 <@Dune_> move downloads, port it to steam, move blog and news
00:37 <@Dune_> it's all ready?
00:38 <@Dune_> @LordSk no, thanks for the reminder
00:38 <@Dune_> I'm busy for a few mins
00:40 < Oy> someone has the rights to edit this post https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12644 ?
00:43 <@heinrich5991> I do
00:44 <@heinrich5991> what needs changing?
00:44 < Oy> could you replace "- Fix resampling" with "- Fixed textures for older graphic cards"
00:45 < Oy> so in case someone didn't see textures in 0.71 he notice the hint to try again :)
00:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Someone should give oy moderator rights
00:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> merry xmas guys
00:47 < Oy> i have, not everywhere it seems :)
00:48 < Oy> and i always have to answer the spam questions when posting in the internal forum...
00:48 < Oy> merry christmas everyone :)
00:50 < Oy> one spam question is tricky: "which weapon doesn't run out of ammo". answered gun at first :P
00:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> hammer u silly ðŸ˜›
00:51 < Oy> :P
00:51 < Oy> but hammer doesn't have ammo perse :D
00:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> tricky
00:52 <@heinrich5991> so it can't run out of it ^^
00:52 < Oy> :D
00:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> what do you guys think about this body markings
00:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix>

00:58 < Oy> Sonix: gives the tee an angry look :)
00:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> does it look good tho? ðŸ˜›
00:59 < Oy> yeah
01:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> trying some markings that I had on my custom skins
01:00 < Oy> skin parts should really be expanded for 0.8
01:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah, I agree
01:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11530
01:02 < Oy> some good examples
01:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> they all look amazing @Sonix
01:10 <@Dune> minus: any idea why Oy always gets spam questions in the private forum
01:10 <@Dune> I edit the release announcement and push the red button?
01:10 <@Dune> Oy: github release, go?
01:10 < Oy> sure
01:10 < Oy> done
01:10 < minus> what
01:10 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy tagged 0.7.2 at master: https://git.io/fhU6y
01:11 < Oy> minus i always get spam questions when i want to post in the internal forum
01:12 < Oy> how many ammo has the grenade etc.
01:12 < minus> you mean a captcha?
01:12 < minus> hm
01:12 < minus> no idea
01:12 < Oy> ok
01:16 < Oy> minus: http://www.solidfiles.com/v/d8VWPKqeP5kzL
01:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> 5
01:18 < Oy> updated github release with the link to release post in the forum
01:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Problem with moving posts/threads
01:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> is that u dont see the *new post* icon active
01:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that is because you saw the post in the internal part, I believe :)
01:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> thanks Oy
01:21 < Oy> btw. i delete the binaries from 0.7.1-rc on github
01:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> good
01:22 <@Dune> Steam release time
01:22 < Oy> or delete the whole 0.7.1-rc release? don't think it's needed
01:22 < Oy> +anymore
01:23 <@Dune> you can, yeah
01:23 < Oy> ok
01:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Nah, Since i dont have access to it
01:23 <@Dune> heinrich5991: I should write a steam news, right
01:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i think
01:23 < Oy> Sonix u can't see temp-section?
01:24 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy deleted 0.7.1-rc at a25f7e5: https://git.io/fhUit
01:24 <@heinrich5991> steam build live
01:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @Dune perhaps mention santa hats in the news post?
01:24 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy deleted 0.7-beta at 3bb6f9d: https://git.io/fpoD1
01:25 < minus> spam less, Oy
01:25 < Oy> :P
01:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Technically you kinda did with the surprise line I guess ...
01:26 <@Dune> done @LordSk
01:26 <@Dune> better?
01:26 <@heinrich5991> homepage updated
01:26 < minus> Oy: disabled that extensions, no more questions for you
01:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> perfect ðŸ˜ƒ
01:26 < minus> let's see if spam takes overhand
01:26 < Oy> minus: thx :D
01:27 < Oy> heinrich5991: great :)
01:27 < minus> on a slightly related note: punbb hasn't received updates in years
01:27 <@heinrich5991> yes, realized that, too :(
01:27 < minus> latest release is over 3 years old
01:27 <@heinrich5991> like four years or so
01:27 <@Dune> btw [h] tags don't work in news/blog
01:28 < minus> latest minor version release was 7 years ago
01:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> time to move onto something that is fresher? perhaps
01:29 < minus> just move to mailing lists like https://lists.sr.ht
01:29 <@Dune> https://steamcommunity.com/games/380840/announcements/detail/1705074470274219260
01:29 <@heinrich5991> "Teeworlds has posted an announcement" â€” steam popup
01:35 <@Dune> That seems to wrap it up
01:35 <@Dune> Hope there are no broken links this time
01:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I wish santa hats lasted longer ðŸ˜¦
01:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> With current speed of development, the trailer on site and o steam will be outdated soon ðŸ˜„
01:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> they look so cute
01:36 <@Dune> Well, you can always wait for next year's christmas :D
01:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> next year we'll have 3D hats
01:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and lootboxes
01:37 < Oy> open f1 and type in "cl_show_xmas_hats 2" :D
01:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ðŸ˜ƒ
01:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Rare skins for grenade launcher for christmas gifts (paid 2$ per box0
01:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> thank you @Dune for doing all the release stuff once again!
01:38 < Oy> yeah, thx, good job :)
01:38 < Oy> heinrich5991: too :)
01:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> heinrich5991 too of course ðŸ˜ƒ
01:40 <@Dune> Oy always does the hard issues, I just bloat the backlog :D
01:41 <@Dune> Good job everyone, 15 days of interval between releases sure is nice :)
01:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Almost like Epic Games, with Fortnite
01:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> lol
01:44 < Oy> is that any good?
01:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Fast releases?
01:45 < Oy> fortnite
01:46 <@Dune> probably depends on your age
01:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> teeworlds is better
01:48 <@Dune> fortnite copied LTS tbh
01:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> actually, I don't really know. Fortnite has quite big fan base, and they are growing pretty fast recently. Frequent updates, with new content and balance update, satisfy players
01:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> but they also jumped into a trand, called battleroyal
01:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> we have LTS, so!
01:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> maybe teeworlds will explode ðŸ˜„
01:50 < Oy> :D
01:51 <@Dune> I would like to send special thanks to @ChillerDragon who fought with his mac to get us a fast Mac release despite thai diseases and exhaustion
01:51 < Oy> get well soon ChillerDragon :)
01:53 <@Dune> I'll go to bed now. christmas is tomorrow here :)
01:53 <@Dune> good night!
01:53 < Oy> gn8 Dune
01:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> good night ðŸ˜ƒ Well done!
07:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh good morning.. sorry for sleeping -.-
07:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I see you rebuild my mac rls xd. But if everything works i am happy c:
07:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh by the way  does anyone has an idea why i cant get any networking connection with my gui teeworlds clients on my macbook? 0.6 doesnt work 0.7 doesnt work. I cant get master server connections and i cant connect via ip directly. My 0.6 client without graphics is able to connect tho.
07:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the macos steam rls launches btw
07:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh btw i am on almost 30 tw related discord servers and it is nice to see that different people spread the 0.7.2 rls all over the place c:
09:15 < Oy> hey
09:15 < Oy> we have to fix the release https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1929 :(
09:18 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy tagged 0.7.1-rc at a25f7e5: https://git.io/fpKgn
09:19 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/fhUSH
09:19 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 4f7a521 oy: fixed disabling the xmas hats. closes #1929
09:19 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master f20f509 oy: Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
09:41 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy deleted 0.7.2 at b4101dc: https://git.io/fhU9m
09:44 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy tagged 0.7.2 at master: https://git.io/fhU6y
09:48 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy deleted 0.7.1-rc at a25f7e5: https://git.io/fhUit
11:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Hey
11:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Oy: build a fixed win/osx version, I guess
11:17 < Oy> yeah. moved the tag, so src's win and osx are fixed on github
11:18 < Oy> the linux releases on github still need fixing
11:18 < Oy> and then the copys (teeworlds.download, steam)
11:20 < Oy> always have the bear skin, so didn't notice you get it when the xmas hat isn't showing :(
11:20 < Oy> sry
11:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Me too lol
11:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Will this bug occur to everyone on 26/12?
11:26 < Oy> on 27th yeah
11:27 < Oy> should probably add a note to the download, that people should redownload
11:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Link to changelog is missing under 0.7.2  in the downloads page
11:52 <@Dune> uploading linux 32/64bits to github
11:53 <@Dune> teeworlds.com downloads are already updated (they link to github for now)
11:53 <@Dune> heinrich5991 will have to do steam
11:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Sonix is right
12:01 <@Dune> Changelog added, and a warning too
12:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oy skinleaks xd
12:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> lol that warning
12:07 <@heinrich5991> at some point we should maybe just throw out a new release ^^
12:07 <@heinrich5991> teeworlds.com downloads not updated I guess?
12:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> heinrich5991: they link to github
12:19 <@heinrich5991> but we also store a copy of each release on teeworlds.com
12:19 <@heinrich5991> I'll update both
12:23 <@Dune> once teeworlds.com is updated, downloads should be edited
12:24 <@heinrich5991> should they?
12:24 <@heinrich5991> I think us using github as CDN is fine
12:24 <@heinrich5991> unless there's some UX problem with that
12:24 <@Dune> I don't know, either works
12:25 <@heinrich5991> teeworlds.com updated
12:26 <@Dune> :)
12:28 < minus> Yeah, always good to archive releases outside of github
12:30 <@heinrich5991> new steam release out
12:30 <@heinrich5991> hope I didn't mess anything up
12:32 < minus> Write a checklist how to do it
12:34 <@heinrich5991> yes. or a script
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Steam players will have updated version immediately, that's cool
12:37 <@Dune> yeah
12:38 <@Dune> wrt to what minus said yesterday: bringing CI back would be nice, but I don't know who could do that
12:39 <@Dune> I don't have the skills
12:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> dune, something is wrong in this version with highdpi mouses....
12:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Maybe, we should add button to steam download right next to current download button?
12:42 <@heinrich5991> I don't like that idea
12:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> dune, nevermind... was my  sdl version ðŸ˜„
12:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Why? I think, that updating thing is much better via steam, than manually downloading binaries
13:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It's better to have teeworlds.com as the clear upstream
13:23 < minus> Dune: it's not hard. well, maybe windows and osx are a bit
13:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> But if we have steam version, why not to mention that on site next to standard download? :)
13:45 < Oy> btw. the default download on the front page of the website uses the teeworlds downloads
13:46 < Oy> haha that warning :D
13:47 < minus> hm, i'll play a round
13:49 < Oy> we used to have a buildbot in the past
13:49 < minus> yeah
13:49 < minus> i ran thast
13:49 < minus> but buildbot sucks
13:50 < minus> linux is pretty much a no-brainer to get going
13:50 < minus> could run those builds on https://builds.sr.ht
13:50 < minus> windows and osx... that's another story
13:50 < minus> windows may be doable with travis or circleci
13:51 < minus> i think we've had someone run a buildslave on osx in the past
13:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> 1 question, is the network stuff of 0.7.xxxxx 100% finished and it wouldnt changed again?
13:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> if yes, then i will update my mod
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> It won't change until 0.8 @FluffiexD
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> so i can wait 2 month for 0.8 release
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> good
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ðŸ˜„
14:40 < minus> :D
14:41 < minus> played for almost an hour there :o i still suck though
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> AppVeyor for windows CI?
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> and linux, probably
14:44 <@Dune> minus feeling nostalgic? :D
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> it's free for open-source projects, I Guess
14:45 < minus> i never played teeworlds much, Dune
14:45 <@Dune> oh, I see
14:45 <@Dune> didn't know
14:45 <@Dune> you came from soldat?
14:45 < minus> probably not even 50h total
14:45 < minus> yes
14:45 < minus> that i played *a lot*
14:45 <@Dune> never played :|
14:46 < minus> new version of that is coming out too
14:46 < minus> after years of death
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> ðŸ˜® Soldat Polish game, didn't know
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I played it once.. a 10 years ago
15:14 < Oy> minus: bnn used to run the buildslave for osx
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <magnet> Bnn is still around btw
15:40 < minus> not here tho
15:40 < minus> since teeworlds dev is alive again, does that also mean he'll continue on trinitee?
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> are blank nicknames allowed?
15:50 <@Dune> yes. identical nicknames too
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> well they shouldnt be empty imo
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> unless u enable anti-social thing
16:01 <@Dune> well you can always have a ` nickname. I don't know why empty were allowed
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> if u have ids disabled
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> and 2 empty nicknames
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> it gets confusing
16:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> f.e
16:07 <@Dune> it does, but it is difficult to detect similar nicknames
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <magnet> i doubt it minus, he hasn't touched trinitee in years and doubt he'll pick it up again. there were talks of restarting the work though
16:36 < minus> :D
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think it is feasible to detect similar nicknames
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think so too, yeah
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hey @ChillerDragon, you here?
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> cool. would you mind testing my cmake-generated mac release?
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> eh no
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/temp/teeworlds-0.7.2-osx.dmg
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no? ðŸ˜¦
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no i dont mind means y i want do do it right?
19:04 <@Dune> you wouldn²t mind?
19:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> mac out of battery -.-
19:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sec
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> looks empty to me
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i forgot how the other cmake rlses looked like but i think they were always that empty
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> oh?
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i think the make_release.py also adds license.txt and storage etc
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the cmake only has the client and server app
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> just realized that
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah. I can add that as well. storage.cfg is useless though I think
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> agree
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> client launched
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> still cant find servers -.-
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> have you throwing wireshark at the problem?
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> server launched as well
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> have you tried*
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no cuz i succ at wireshark
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i dont expect gettign any valuable information out of it
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ur rls looks pretty good to me
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> cool ðŸ™‚
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but its my laptop
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ima test it on my moms device
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> to make sure
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> nice, ty
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in what way do they differ? dev/non-dev laptop?
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it mostly fails on missing libs installed on my moms laptop
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but they work on mine
19:11 < minus> just allow the same characters for nicknames irc also allows
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> limiting to ascii gets you mostly there in terms of distinguishability
19:12 <@heinrich5991> but you can also get further, and still support unicode :)
19:12 <@heinrich5991> ascii still has Il1, rnm
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> launched on my moms laptop heinrich5991
19:13 <@heinrich5991> nice :)
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i realized i had brew and some compilers installed there xd
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but i dont think i installed any libs there
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it should be fine
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ok
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> always spamming family members hardware with dev software xd
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ^^
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I know that ðŸ™‚
19:17 < minus> that's a font problem then though, heinrich5991
19:17 <@heinrich5991> no
19:17 <@heinrich5991> it might be a font problem for programming etc.
19:17 <@heinrich5991> but not for normal fonts. lI1 are expected to look similar
19:17 <@heinrich5991> that's just the way these letters look in sans-serif fonts
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye thats why they succ
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lez use andale mono instead :p
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> looks nicer anyways
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon do you know why it says "unknown repository" on your pull request? https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/pull/15
21:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> trying to get your commit, but I don't know howâ€¦
21:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah, good old `git fetch origin pull/15/head` worked
21:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I wonder why that isn't on the github pull request page
21:51 <@Dune> it does? huh
21:51 <@Dune> I had given up and manually applied the changes
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I have sent it before ðŸ˜› You should check
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but that should be on the PR page
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I shouldn't have to remember that it exists and what it's called
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I agree ðŸ˜ƒ
