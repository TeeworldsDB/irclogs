13:05 < LCPL_Cat> yo
13:05 <@heinrich5991> hi
13:07 < LCPL_Cat> are you still developing teeworlds
13:07 < ZeloAvarosa> Hello?
13:09 < LCPL_Cat> hey
13:09 <@heinrich5991> teeworlds development seems to have slowed to a halt. I don't know
13:09 <@heinrich5991> there are some actively developed mods
13:11 < ZeloAvarosa> it's an old game, but me and Cat play it regularly
13:11 < ZeloAvarosa> and quite like it, its movement is quite easy to pick up but has a high skill ceiling
13:11 < ZeloAvarosa> I have personally commented myself that I wished it would get big
13:12 <@heinrich5991> I also quite like it :)
13:13 < ZeloAvarosa> Are you the developer?
13:19 <@heinrich5991> no, I'm not
13:20 <@heinrich5991> the main developer is oy, he's not on this channel though
13:20 <@heinrich5991> I've contributed in the past
13:22 < ZeloAvarosa> mmm, alright
13:22 < ZeloAvarosa> I guess I'll hang around 
13:22 < ZeloAvarosa> do you only talk here?
13:25 <@heinrich5991> there's little talk happening here nowadays
13:25 <@heinrich5991> but there's no other place either, so yea
13:26 < ZeloAvarosa> I would offer to help but I only know VB 
13:27 < LCPL_Cat> you should migrate to discord 
13:27 < LCPL_Cat> I am willing to setup everything for you
13:30 <@heinrich5991> https://discord.gg/vY7PDkH, but this channel here is more active
13:30 <@heinrich5991> also the bridge seems to be defunct :(
13:31 < ZeloAvarosa> bridge?
14:40 < day> discord lol
14:43 < day> i think age isnt a problem for teeworlds. the graphic is imho timeless. I believe the main issue is that it is designed as a casual shooter. theres no community aspect inside the game.
14:45 < day> but on the other hand you are dealing with a game that benefits massively from training
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> hello?
14:47 < day> bridge: hello
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> hi there,
14:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> The thing about Teeworlds, is that it has the capacity to be a really popular game
14:50 <@minus> it was a fairly popular game
14:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> and it died out, huh, I wonder how that worked
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> I can think of a few things to help Teeworlds popularity, one is optimising the interface, second is having a help screen/tutorial for first visitors and third is getting curators to review the game
14:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> i’d also recommend one button click and play with dedicated servers but I believe that may be out of scope
15:33 <@heinrich5991> mh.
15:34 <@heinrich5991> optimizing interface +
15:34 <@heinrich5991> help screen/tutorial +!
15:35 <@heinrich5991> dedicated servers, would be nice, but out of scope for now I think
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> I can probably help design a tutorial
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> perhaps a starting map, where players go right to left with all the necessary things to learn, similar to Cupheads tutorial
15:42 <@heinrich5991> huh, haven't played cuphead
15:42 <@heinrich5991> maybe I should :)
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> its a pretty simple tutorial, shows shooting, dashing, jumping and countering
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> in this, it could just be showing off double jumping, swinging and the different weapons
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> perhaps with some bots to beat up to get started
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> from what I can tell, new players don’t really know what they’re doing
15:46 <@heinrich5991> yea, the only thing you can do is jump directly into the game ^^
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> Also, the beginning interface looks like a source legacy browser
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> optimising that can help newcomers much more easily find a game
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> thats all I can suggest right now
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LCPL Cat> What is the gam made on
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LCPL Cat> Game*
15:51 <@heinrich5991> it's using SDL, using OpenGL for graphics, it's written in C+(+) :)
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LCPL Cat> Oof
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> I’ve been meaning to learn C#, I guess Ill have to change to C++
17:46 < rand> Learn rust and re-code the game from scratch with respect to the protocol
