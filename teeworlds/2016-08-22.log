00:01 <@minus> wasn't me, i swear
08:31 < rand> :D
21:19 < kingteeger> hi, is it just me or is the master server down? (i cant find anny servers)
21:20 < kingteeger> i've aleready deleted my %appdata%/teeworlds folder (win)
21:20 < Henningstone> dos'd since days as it seems ._.
21:20 < kingteeger> oh hey henning :) thx fyi
21:21 < Henningstone> but I can send you a cfg file that will add all servers to your favorites, so you can play anyway ;)
21:21 < kingteeger> yea that would be nice
21:26 < rand> violent
21:27 < Henningstone> huh?
22:03 < rand> why would dht need a blockchain ?
22:04 < rand> (violent → i meant, it sounds like a far too big favorites list ^^)
22:05 <@minus> yeah, no idea what a blockchain would be of use for
22:06 <@minus> a web of trust however…
22:08 < rand> that might be a joke then
22:09 < rand> blockchain is a mainstream keyword these days :)
22:27 < eeeee> could make teeworlds serverless if you publish player input on a blockchain, gameplay would be more like a turn based strategy though.
22:30 < WolfAlex_> wtf
22:37 <@minus> i see you nicely snuck serverless in there
