13:57 < Savander> Hey! :), Someone knows, where i can add "scheduler"? I think..  which class. You know, i want send message every x seconds :P. It's in gamecontroler.cpp? Sorry for this stupid question ;p
13:58 <@matricks> scheduler?
13:59 < heinrich5991> Savander: you can make a variable that saves the next time a thing should be executed
13:59 < heinrich5991> whenever your current time is greater than that variable
13:59 < heinrich5991> you execute the code
14:00 < heinrich5991> and set the variable to the current time + some interval
14:02 < Savander> OK, i'll try this, thanks :)
15:01 <@matricks> minus: I've been wondering how to make the server event based so it only wakes up when there is something to be done...
15:02 <@matricks> minus: but I havn't figured out how to make something tick at 25/50 hz reliably
15:03 <@minus> matricks: select?
15:03 <@matricks> select I wonder if that is reliable
15:08 <@minus> matricks: what's the allowed margin of error
15:08 <@matricks> very low
15:08 <@matricks> sub ms
15:08 <@minus> not a chance then
15:09 <@matricks> btw, I got filmed this tuesday :D
15:09 <@matricks> by a hexacopter
15:09 <@minus> you can break before and busy-loop, but even then select might not be reliable
15:09 <@minus> heh

15:10 <@minus> heh
15:11 <@matricks> they happend to be on the training hill when I was there
15:12 <@minus> :)
15:12 <@minus> matricks: what happens when your server process is not scheduled to run for 50ms? does that happen?
15:13 <@matricks> I think there is a select that whats for packets actually
15:13 <@minus> yes, select works on file descriptors, including network sockets
15:14 <@matricks> and I think that one is good enough for waking up close enough.. I think that how it's done now
15:15 <@minus> seems like the deviation with select is -0.25 and +1.3ms for 1ms interval, less at higher intervals
15:18 <@minus> but yeah, looks like select/equivalent replacements achieve sub-millisecond accuracy

16:50 < heinrich5991> minus: do you know that you leak your username like this?
16:52 <@minus> heinrich5991: wow, that's gay, thanks for letting me know
16:53 <@minus> http://coderbyte.com/
16:53 < heinrich5991> what's that?
16:54 <@minus> a site with problems to solve
16:54 <@minus> http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/information.php?ct=Shortest%20Path ← just did that one. not bad.
16:55 < heinrich5991> python I suppose?
16:55 <@minus> you can choose
16:55 <@minus> oh, yes
16:55 <@minus> i do python
16:55 < heinrich5991> did you use A* or plain djikstra?
16:55 <@minus> uh
16:56 <@minus> i just found the shortest path :P
16:56 < heinrich5991> oh, looking at the challenge, I see A* isn't possible
16:56 < heinrich5991> oh
16:56 <@minus> no need for dijkstra, there are no loops
16:56 < heinrich5991> no loops?
16:56 < heinrich5991> why do they call it 'shortest path'? :D
16:57 <@minus> well, i'm assuming only start/finish
17:00 < EastByte> minus: C in coderbyte.com always gives me "ERROR!" on run :(
18:42 < heinrich5991> minus: do you know why the submit button is greyed out?
18:42 <@minus> heinrich5991: because you need an account
18:42 <@minus> had me puzzled too
