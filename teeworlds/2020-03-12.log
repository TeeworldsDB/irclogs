13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Why does the spectator selector menu sort by client id, thats annoying imo. if you look at the scoreboard all the time, then the spec selector you have a different order
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in ddnet client (idk if it was in vanilla 0.6 too) its sorted the same way
13:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ddnet does what ddnet does (2nd rule of the fightclub). open an issue on github, I think it will be ignored otherwise, after some minor discussion.
17:52 < Learath2> You'd have more luck just implementing it @fokkonaut, srsly it's not rocket science
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Learath2: re serverinfo protocol
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in what way is it currently not compatible?
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no issue, probably pr will never get merged.
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> is that so?
18:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> my gut feeling
19:10 < Learath2> @heinrich5991 the new reserved extrainfo fields
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah right
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you can add a field in the request
19:12 < Learath2> heinrich5991: at the end? would that be backwards compatible?
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, because I annoyed a certain person enough to allow it ðŸ˜›
19:14 < Learath2> So if the field is present and has some magic value I use the new protocol, if the field is missing I send only the initial packet without the reserved new fields?
19:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
20:37 < rand> could a SERVERBROWSE_GETLIST/LIST be introduced ?
20:38 < rand> I found that 'reqt' -> 'req2' is from 0.6
20:39 < rand> (ipv6 support :o)
20:42 < rand> Learath2: my bad, I forget to commit big enough bots name/clan tag
