13:57 < ChillerDragun> @Ryozuki new chat options when? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1587038205.png
13:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> never
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> i dont think ill code for tw
13:58 < ChillerDragun> rq
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :0
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :dedpepe:
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> "Dragun"
13:58 < ChillerDragun> ye big fake
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :ban:
13:59 < ChillerDragon> seriously who is this guy?
13:59 < ChillerDragun> i am u
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> he is you from an earlier era.
14:00 < ChillerDragon> ur zcatch server rocks btw
14:00 < ChillerDragon> i play on it daily currently
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> why, I wonder
14:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ChillerDragun: *insert japanese gibberish*
14:05 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2277
14:05 < Ryozuki> and its already coded
14:05 < Ryozuki> but its bloat according to tw
14:05 < Ryozuki> we have already been through this
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> had a non gui version.
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> also a pr, if I remember correctly
14:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> people want, but people don't get
14:09 < Ryozuki> ChillerDragon https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/682188623101165653/695222187472453722/unknown.png this is the mindset i dont agree with
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> chat sounds are annoying. the client should at least add spl0k's gui stuff. where one can turn off HUD elements and change sound options.
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> There is literally an accepted issue about adding more chat options, I don't know what you're ranting about
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> pereonalization is king.
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> its no just chat
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> but its always like this
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I know, it's wasted effort.
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> sometimes it's more satisfying to do your own projects.
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> or to work on projects with more common sense
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> *
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> also easier to talk shit about what others do :)
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> this is not about what others do
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> its about what others forbid to do
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I don't talk shit, I have the same experience here.
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and you are always offended by everything, Dune.
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> dune is to prideful
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you gotta chill
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> its useless to argue
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> we will just get banned
14:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> spl0k's HUD settings tab would be neat :/ that's like the basic of the basics that all clients since 0.6 had. would make vanilla more versatile.
14:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I also think that adding an option is the easy way out
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I would prefer to make sensible defaults or sensible, but *few* options
14:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> toggle hud, toggle sound, there was some third commontly requested ootion, that I forgot
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (server message + global/team chatmessage) as one checkbox. (nickname highlight + whisper) as second checkbox for sounds maybe.
16:27 < ChillerDragun> yea hiding chat would be very nice as a hud option
16:47 < Dune> ChillerDragun: the most difficult part is to design this stuff for the GUI :/
16:47 < Dune> chat-related options should be tuneable at one place, and none really fits or has much room, so a bit of redesign seems mandatory
17:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> are there multiple tabs like one tab for graphics, one tab for sound?
17:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hiding chat(still readable from f1) one checkbox, hiding rest of the GUI(maybe time visible for race?) second checkbox
17:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> crosshair visible in any case
17:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> broadcast should also be visible in any case
19:51 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2562 fixes all chat command issues?
19:52 < Dune> Oy: we iterated a bunch with Learath2, I think it's alright, should test more
19:52 < Dune> the problems that I know of are all solved at least
19:53 < Oy> ok then i merge it :)
19:53 < Oy> it's just that there were lots of problems with that feature so far :P
19:53 < Dune> yeah that's very unfortunate
19:54 < Dune> I share part of the faults for the hasty code design
19:54 < Dune> but it's a tricky feature in general
19:54 < Dune> and many different people stacked features on top of it :p
19:55 < Oy> should probably refactor that stuff someday
19:55 < Dune> definitely
19:55 < Oy> chat got bloated since 0.6 ;)
19:55 < Dune> oh yeah
19:56 < Dune> I'll try to do some qcheck tomorrow :)
19:57 < Dune> 11 languages done
19:57 < Oy> great :)
19:57 < Dune> need italian, spanish, norwegian
19:57 < Dune> @MertenNor
19:58 < Oy> what else need to be done for a release?
19:58 < Dune> any bug introduced since 074 should be fixed
19:58 < Dune> not sure if any is left
19:59 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2559 probably maybe
19:59 < Dune> -probably
19:59 < Dune> I forgot when we changed warmups
19:59 < Dune> probably at every release :D
19:59 < Oy> wonder when that got introduced
19:59 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2552 is a must have
20:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <MertenNor> @Dune is there a deadline? Real busy these days
20:00 < Dune> @mertennor this weekend
20:00 < Dune> there's like 10 strings to translate though
20:01 < Oy> i'll fix the 2552 one
20:01 < Dune> ah, right
20:01 < Dune> so yeah we're good
20:01 < Dune> just need some qcheck on recent UI changes
20:03 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2380 no clue what's up with that
20:04 < Dune> huh oh, did we change the submodule commit since 074?
20:04 < Dune> for maps
20:05 < Dune> or was the packaging script that was downloading it and setting it to master commit?
20:05 < Oy> no, will update it
20:12 < Oy> not sure about https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2383/files
20:12 < Oy> it changes behaviour
20:12 < Oy> it expects and integer
20:15 < ChillerDragun> can we get demo cutting Oy? <3
20:16 < Oy> nope
20:16 < ChillerDragun> yikes why?
20:17 < Oy> at least not in 0.7.5
20:17 < ChillerDragun> any reason?
20:17 < Oy> prevent possible bugs
20:18 < ChillerDragun> i see
20:18 < ChillerDragun> I mean i am using it since a few days and it works superb
20:19 < ChillerDragun> it for sure has bugs but is better than nothing
20:21 < Oy> :P
20:21 < Oy> should be pretty stable for a release
20:22 < Oy> on a different note: a test team could be good
20:28 < ChillerDragun> we have nightly testing since a lot of people use gamer,zilly or fokko client which update to master here and then
20:29 < ChillerDragun> also server side a bit
21:19 < Dune> what do you mean by nightly testing?
21:20 < Dune> Oy: not sure about 2383 either
21:21 < Dune> the PR is well split in commits so it's possible to cherry pick a few though
21:22 < Oy> yeah, will probably pick the rest then
21:44 < ChillerDragun> Dune isnt nightly a term to use for builds from master that are not official releases?
21:44 < ChillerDragun> so tw master is currently tested by active players
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes, but i didnt know people play on nightly?
