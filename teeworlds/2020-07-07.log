10:15 < ChillerDragon> Its been almost 1 year now that my muzzle memory is bleeding :/ can we get some progress (close/merge) on https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2192 please?
10:15 < ChillerDragon> adwawd
10:15 < ChillerDragon> woops
11:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: #2521 should also help with this, except for end and start not being on every keyboard
14:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> End and start are already implemented afaik
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> (by using the end start keys, which are not always there on keyboards)
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Albeit I've always found one, even if hidden behind an Fn
16:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> add ctrl+z/ctrl+y to editor xd
16:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that is https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/552 :)
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> hm, maybe it doesnt work in ddnet client
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's not in any released teeworlds version yet
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> besides, ddnet is 0.6 afaik
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> huh
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> bad
17:06 < ChillerDragon> guiiis @Dune @Learath2 it is not about some features to do something with text in console it about console navigation convention
17:07 < ChillerDragon> I press ctrl+a ctrl+u ctrl+e ctrl+k ctrl+r without thinking its muzzle memory because literally every other console like environment except teeworlds supports it
17:10 < Learath2> ctrl+a will soon be select all, so you'd do well to forget that one :D
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's probably what the large majority of teeworlds users will expect ctrl+a to do
18:08 < ChillerDragon> ok thats sad :/ I guess ill have to fork then ._.
18:09 < ChillerDragon> anyone else having ci issues?
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> hmm, adding blueprints to editor - would it make sense <.<
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> blueprints?
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> What kind?
