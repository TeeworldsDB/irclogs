11:52 < Hausdorff> Have there been any ladders / ranked matchmaking for vanilla teeworlds?
11:54 < Learath2> heard some people are working on it
11:55 < Learath2> not enough players to justify the work needed for setting up an entire ladder imho
11:56 <@minus> teeworlds seems pretty dead to me; almost as dead as soldat
11:56 < Learath2> we do our best to keep ddnet alive but even that is losing players iirc
11:57 <@minus> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
12:16 < Hausdorff> :(
12:53 < coffee> make a solo campaign :p
13:14 < koomi> there is a race mode ;-)
15:34 < deen> Learath2: ddnet player numbers have been relatively stable for the last 2 years
17:53 < Learath2> that is good to hear \o/
18:00 < Ledocraft> Hey is there someone who can help me? There is a server full with dummies. I think it's to push the server if you sort after players. Address: 165.227.133.169:8300
21:07 < Hausdorff> Maybe I'll /redraw
21:07 < Hausdorff> ignore that
