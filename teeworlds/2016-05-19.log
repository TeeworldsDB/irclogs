20:07 < fin> Hello, can someone help me? I have a problem with running a teeworlds server on an linux server.
20:15 <@minus> hi
20:16 < fin> hi
20:16 < fin> you use linux?
20:17 <@minus> i AM linux
20:17 <@minus> i'm in your router, shoveling packets
20:17 <@minus> but seriously, just ask
20:21 < fin> ok, wait
20:22 < fin> ./finblock64: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.21' not found (required by ./finblock64) ./finblock64: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found (required by ./finblock64) ./finblock64: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.15' not found (required by ./finblock64) ./finblock64: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by ./finblock64)
20:22 < fin> i have no idea how to fix that problem
20:22 < fin> i need the libs, but dont know how to get them...i am new in linux
20:23 <@minus> did you compile that binary yourself?
20:23 < fin> yes
20:23 <@minus> well, that's very odd then
20:24 < fin> what?
20:24 <@minus> on the same system?
20:25 < fin> no, compiled on xUbuntu, runned on debian
20:25 < fin> should i compile it on the server?
20:25 < EastByte> yes, you should do that
20:36 < LittleWhite> If you really want to compile on another machine (which is not the easiest) you have to compile in a specific way where you are lowering the glibc (standard library) requirement
20:36 < fin> what?
20:36 < fin> sorry, i was away
20:36 < fin> you think it hasr to compile on the server?
20:36 < LittleWhite> It is easier :)
20:37 < fin> i see xD
20:37 < fin> root@kd40727:~/fin#  bam server_release -bash: bam: command not found
20:37 < LittleWhite> but, it is also possible to compile it from a differnt machine
20:37 < fin> bam is in the folder
20:37 < LittleWhite> you should not, really should not compile as root
20:37 < fin> why=?
20:37 < LittleWhite> because root has all the power, and with the power comes responsability
20:38 < LittleWhite> and high chances to break something too :D
20:38 < fin> oh
20:38 < fin> i always compile as root xD
20:38 < fin> othing broke
20:38 < fin> but my problem is now:
20:38 < LittleWhite> moreover, it will possibly annoy you with right
20:38 < fin> root@kd40727:~/fin#  bam server_release -bash: bam: command not found
20:38 < fin> but bam is in the folder
20:38 < LittleWhite> ok back to the problem
20:38 < LittleWhite> you have to write : ./bam
20:38 < LittleWhite> the dot and slash means : this actual folder
20:38 < LittleWhite> (actually, just the dot means that, the slash is a separator)
20:39 < fin> root@kd40727:~/fin#  bam server_release -bash: bam: command not found
20:39 < fin> wait
20:39 < fin> -bash: ./bam: No such file or directory
20:39 <@minus> you should compile bam on the same machine too (or install it from the package manager)
20:40 < fin> phu...can you explain to me how to compile bam
20:41 <@minus> install it from the package manager, it should be there
20:41 < fin> whats the command? sudo apt-get install bam?
20:41 <@minus> yeah
20:42 < fin> it s normal that bam is a lua?
20:44 < fin> omg
20:44 < fin> root@kd40727:~/fin# sudo apt-get install bam Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree        Reading state information...

20:45 < fin> well i don't use the latest version of debian, but it must work with this one
20:51 < fin> help? :D
20:52 <@minus> did you run apt-get update?
20:53 <@minus> if that fails too your OS is too old to still get updates and you should upgrade to a newer version
20:54 < fin> but i have no other opton, its not my server
20:55 < fin> how can i compile bam for debian from my ubuntu mashien?
21:01 < fin> mate?
