01:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> How many snap objects can the client receive at once?
01:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I have plots on my server, where players can place entities using a custom ingame-editor, at the moment its limited, but i would like to give a bit more freedom to use like 200 objets on a plot, i tested it with ~ 200 and it worked, but no idea how it will go when everybody has so many objects
01:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> okay, 400 seems to work too
13:06 < deen> minus: sorry for the confusion, we just noticed there is only one remaining TW 0.6 master server, so we bought a new server to run for it: 49.12.97.180 (master.ddnet.tw). It's set up exactly like the old one from ddnet.tw and running already.
13:08 < Dune> so there are now two 0.6 masterservers?
13:10 < minus> deen: CNAME'd
13:10 < deen> thanks minus
13:10 < deen> Dune: yes: https://status.tw/status/
13:11 < Dune> thanks deen
13:12 < minus> so we have 2 parties hosting all masters now
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It has been like that for a while
