18:02 < Madara> Hi!
18:02 < Madara> What's the best way to get the players name in the teeworlds src code?
18:03 < PsychoGod> in server or client part ?
18:03 < Madara> Client
18:07 < PsychoGod> g_Config.m_PlayerName
18:09 < Madara> Ok :D
18:09 < PsychoGod> ;D
18:11 < Madara> mh...
18:12 < Madara> Can I compare them like this? : m_aKillmsgs[r].m_aKillerName == g_Config.m_PlayerName
18:13 < Madara> wait
18:13 < Madara> gonna try something xD
18:14 < Madara> Is m_aKillerName more than just the name?
18:14 < Madara> since it's [64] and not 16
18:16 < PsychoGod> wait i'l look, and str_comp(str1, str2) is the way you can compare
18:16 < PsychoGod> if it's returns 0, str1 == str2
18:17 <@minus> can't == without operator==
18:17 < PsychoGod> if(!str_comp(str1, str2))     yeah.this.matcher();
18:17 < PsychoGod> xD
18:17 < Madara> !str_comp(str1, str2);
18:17 < Madara> ok xD
18:18 < PsychoGod> and it's seems to be just the name, dunno why it's 64 sized
18:18 < Madara> ok
18:18 < Madara> Works how i wanted
18:19 < Madara> just too good
18:19 < Madara> I must restrict it to one time  :D
18:19 < Madara> It will print it every second someone is killed and the msg is viewable
18:19 < Madara> (killmsg)
18:19 < Madara> Thanks PsychoGod
18:20 < PsychoGod> np ;)
18:40 < Madara> fu
18:40 < Madara> Just a question about arrays.
18:40 < Madara> if you do array[64]
18:40 < Madara> what will be the last 'element'?
18:41 < Madara> array[64] or array[63] since it's starting with 0
18:42 < PsychoGod> 63
18:45 < Madara> mmmh
18:45 < Madara> How to get ticks in tw?
18:45 < Madara> There was a function for that.
18:50 < PsychoGod> render is ticking function
18:50 < PsychoGod> in killmesseges
18:55 < Madara> hm
18:56 < Madara> I want to do something like every minute
18:57 < PsychoGod> if(time_get() % (time_freq() * 60) == 0)  {  here 1 minute functions...  }
18:58 < Madara> Ok, that's nice of you :3
18:58 < PsychoGod> put it in render or other tick
18:58 < Madara> yeah
18:58 < Madara> is already in there
18:58 < PsychoGod> n1ce
19:01 < Madara> time_get needs which header?
19:02 < Madara> nah
19:05 < PsychoGod> system.c
19:06 < PsychoGod> #include <base/system.h>
19:08 < Madara> thx
19:21 < Madara> fufufufuf
19:21 < Madara> Im too dumb to program xD
19:23 <@minus> agreed
19:23 < PsychoGod> aha
19:24 < PsychoGod> usually it's not a problam, so feel free to code, sometimes it would be bette ;)
19:25 < Madara> Yeah.
19:26 < Madara> Is there a better than killmsgs to know if you've killed someone?
19:26 < Madara> yes
19:26 < Madara> there is
19:26 < Madara> I will not ask again here
19:26 < Madara> :P
19:44 < Madara> And now it's working
19:44 < Madara> I'm just programming like a cavemen
19:44 < Madara> That's the problem I think
22:57 < Madara> So boring here xD
22:57 <@matricks> schhh.. we are idling
23:04 < Madara> xD
23:14 <@matricks> codin' I should be doing it
23:17 < PsychoGod> what are you coding ?
23:17 <@matricks> been fiddling with rust
23:53 < Learath2> Madara: I would use servers ticks to time stuff 
23:53 < Madara> I'm programming clientside.
23:53 < Madara> Anyway, I have solved that problem already with another method.
23:53 < Madara> (Timing was optional)
23:53 < Learath2> i didnt touch the code for a while but client should tick too
23:54 <@matricks> all depends on what you are trying todo :)
23:54 <@matricks> I think the client has something like 4-5 different times that it uses :P
23:55  * matricks is braining
23:55 < Learath2> Game time, menu time local time 
23:55 < Learath2> dont know the last 2 :D
23:55 <@matricks> thats too few
23:56 < Madara> Hell, that's a lot!
23:56 < Learath2> Prediction ticks i think
23:57 <@matricks> what the hell is menutick?
23:57 <@matricks> oh, for the menu map level thingie?
23:57 < Learath2> ticks in menu ? :D
23:58 < Learath2> i just remember seeing it in a header 
23:58 <@matricks> it has actually less then I thought
23:58 <@matricks> gametick, predicted gametick and local time.. what is local time..
23:59 <@matricks> oh.. time since connect
