10:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> mapres corner hell - there are 2^8 possible 8-neighborhood configurations for a tile, now I understand while tilesets are 16x16 ðŸ˜®
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> can you explain?
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> do you mean that each corner and each side can have "filled" or "not filled"?
23:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> but most of the times we have a vertical symmetry cutting the number in half
23:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i was working on a winter-main from zatline, it has two types of corners/edges: snowed on and not snowed on and it nearly filled the full tileset
