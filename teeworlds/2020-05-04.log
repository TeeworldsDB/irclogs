00:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm k :0
10:44 < ChillerDragon> Hm I was able to tunnel my minecraft server using "ssh -R port:ip:port ip" but it did not work for tw any ideas?
10:45 < ChillerDragon> I thought any traffic can be tunneld or does it loose udp on the way?
11:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what do the logs say? Any errors? `netstat -an --inet | egrep '(^Proto|serverport)'`
12:40 < ChillerDragon> Yea im pretty sure it lacks a udp tunnel which turns out to be more than 1 ssh command
12:40 < ChillerDragon> to lazy to read into udp tunnels today :D
19:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> If I would do a developer contest (with price money), would anyone join it?
19:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what is a developer contest? ðŸ™‚
19:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Remember, that i had the idea of ParTee? A lot of minigames chosen (somehow), each around 5 minutes
19:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> And I am currently creating an API for minigames
19:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so i would create a minigame-contest with prices for the best minigames
20:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what do you think @heinrich5991 ?
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Not sure if you would have a lot of people
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i just wonder if i could get any people
21:17 < ChillerDragon> Oy i dont want to be pushy but i have 4prs open for a while and i really wait for them to be merged :/ anything i can do to get them merged?
21:18 < Oy> probably not
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Assa sorry, went away to watch a movie
21:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ^^
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Assa I think I'm not used to entering those kinds of competitions
22:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I know this kind of competitions from codingames.com, but they use input/output and not an api
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Using Teeworlds to reproduce codinggames sounds like unnecessary extra steps?
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> You missed the point @Dune ðŸ˜„
22:58 < gerdoe> i think it will sound not serious or weird but maybe we must make teeworlds like minecraft... like bukkit/spigot plugin-sides 
22:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> call it Teecraft then
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we had minetee before ðŸ˜‰
23:05 < gerdoe> uhm, i think you didnt understand guys
23:05 < gerdoe> or just kidding
23:06 < gerdoe> im talking about teeworlds' plugin side
23:07 < gerdoe> or addon
23:08 < gerdoe> by polymorphism
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> who would do that and integrate it into a party server? That sounds stupid
23:11 < gerdoe> maybe im in future... anyway now if you want to make mod you must learn all teeworlds code for some features
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe you life in the future ... maybe you read my comment at 19:57
