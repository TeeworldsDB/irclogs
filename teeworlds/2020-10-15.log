17:19 < ChillerDragon> you didnt know either? u guys live under rocks man 
17:19 < ChillerDragon> didnt that start around the time 0.7 rlsd or even earlier or di di confuse something
17:27 < ChillerDragon> also @heinrich5991 pls stap spreading fake news about me on github :/
17:27 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/irclogs/blob/master/ddnet/2020-10-09.log#L600

17:28 < ChillerDragon> Dune and Learath2 recommended hacktoberfest i only pointed out it might lower quality
17:29 <@heinrich5991> oh true, it was Learath2, sorry about that
17:29 < ChillerDragon> also guys if you are concerned about the quality of my prs you can tell me 
17:29 <@heinrich5991> wtf
17:30 <@heinrich5991> it says directly in the rules of hacktoberfest to not do what you do
17:30 < ChillerDragon> well I guess its not to annoy proj owners
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah please don't
17:30 < ChillerDragon> if you dislike my prs you could have told me earlier
17:31 <@heinrich5991> you can reopen that PR when not in october to not appear like you do it just for the hacktoberfest
17:31 < ChillerDragon> or if u want to please hacktoberfest gods i dont add the tag or tell me to wait until its over
17:31 <@heinrich5991> I think people would be less annoyed by that
17:31 < ChillerDragon> and by "the people" you referr to ur self?
17:31 <@heinrich5991> yes
17:31 <@heinrich5991> but I think I also heard Dune and Learath2
17:32 < ChillerDragon> and the reason is to not make digitalocean mad or what?
17:32 <@heinrich5991> no, us
17:32 < Dune> ^
17:32 < ChillerDragon> i dont get it
17:33 < ChillerDragon> so you have a problem with the pr?
17:33 < ChillerDragon> or with the pr in october?
17:33 <@heinrich5991> the PR is *probably* fine outside of hacktoberfest
17:33 < ChillerDragon> but?
17:33 <@heinrich5991> currently it just looks like you spam the repo for getting a repo
17:33 < ChillerDragon> yes?
17:33 < ChillerDragon> it always is
17:33 < ChillerDragon> no matter what time of the year
17:33 < Dune> imo this kind of PR is pure spam regardless of the month. style PRs are fine but batch them into one
17:34 < ChillerDragon> thats all i have
17:34 <@heinrich5991> outside of october, we probably wouldn't have reacted so badly
17:34 <@heinrich5991> I guess(?)
17:34 < ChillerDragon> i guess too
17:34 < ChillerDragon> cuz its not my first pr
17:34 < ChillerDragon> im just trying to understand why u all guys so pissed all of a sudden
17:35 < Dune> it's not in spirit for hacktoberfest and it's annoying for teeworlds
17:35 < ChillerDragon> k ill guess i stop contributing then if its annoying :/ sorry
17:36 < Dune> you are misconstruing what heinrich & I are saying very much in this sentence
17:37 < ChillerDragon> how?
17:38 <@heinrich5991> you can reopen the PR outside of october to get a nicer response
17:38 <@heinrich5991> or do something more substantial now
17:38 < ChillerDragon> "and it's annoying for teeworlds" does not sound like a cotober thing
17:39 <@heinrich5991> yea, Dune and I have a bit differing views there
17:39 <@heinrich5991> seem to have
17:39 < Dune> yea
17:39 <@heinrich5991> I'm okayish with small contributions from new contributors if that is what gets them started
17:39 < ChillerDragon> everything larger tends to get declined
17:40 <@heinrich5991> the last page of PRs only has one closed PR
17:41 <@heinrich5991> all others are merged
17:41 < ChillerDragon> what page?
17:41 < Dune> you haven't had a PR rejected on teeworlds throughout the last year
17:42 < ChillerDragon> bcs i learnt on ddnet what sizes and types of pr are worth a try
17:42 < Dune> maybe ddnet is different - I don't see large prs get rejected at all, though I think it's good to split into independent features when possible
17:42 < ChillerDragon> also have been waiting on crucial prs to be merged for my workflow for month 
17:43 < ChillerDragon> to then get rejected
17:43 < ChillerDragon> everything bigger than a 1liner is usually no fun
17:44 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed this is probably the page heinrich was speaking of - it's all purple
17:44 < ChillerDragon> ah
17:45 <@heinrich5991> although the problem could also be non-rejected PRs, ofc
17:46 <@heinrich5991> 12 out of 20 open PRs are half a year old or older
17:47 < ChillerDragon> yea thats annoying bcs i still am afraight of putting it in a fork if there is a potential upstream merge
17:47 < Dune> that's a good sign - there have been over 250PRs throughout the last year. few recent PRs remain open
17:53 <@heinrich5991> it is not a good sign when PRs stall without explanation
17:54 <@heinrich5991> or if PRs that are not going to be accepted either way stay open
17:55 <@heinrich5991> (but in other areas, teeworlds did well this year, I agree. lots of PRs getting looked at)
21:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <a gerdoe> @ChillerDragon: i guess https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/mapres has name duplicate mapres (because winrar said this. as i know, windows thinks aA.png == aa.png)
22:18 < ChillerDragonTL> I can look into it if it makes trouble on windows 
22:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <a gerdoe> yeah, thanks
