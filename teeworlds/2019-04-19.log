00:23 < Fudgy> I had that issue when I added a command with a + in front of it
00:23 < Fudgy> it would be called twice when I pressed the associated key
00:23 < Fudgy> so I just removed the + lol
12:35 < Dune> Yeah teeworlds has some dark magic
21:37 < Oy> Dune: ping
21:37 < Dune> pong
21:43 < Dune> Oy
21:44 < Oy> i'd add all the code stuff left, alright?
21:44 < Oy> or you want to wait with?
21:44 < Dune> yeah you can add
21:44 < Dune> check forum
21:45 < Dune> oh, you did
21:45 < Oy> yeah
21:45 < Dune> when the code is in, I'll do linux
21:46 < Oy> ok
22:02 < Oy> Dune: what do u think about https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2099 ?
22:03 < Dune> it's a tough one
22:03 < Oy> skip for now?
22:03 < Dune> yeah I would say
22:03 < Oy> ok
22:06 < Oy> code is ready
22:06 < Dune> :)
22:06 < Oy> oh wait
22:06 < Oy> have to update submodules
22:07 < Dune> and the game version?
22:07 < Oy> already done
22:09 < Dune> getting errors
22:10 < Dune_linux> https://pastebin.com/ejbthUB0
22:12 < Dune> heinrich5991, ^ btw
22:12 < Dune> maybe cmake sets the right flags and not bam, I'm using bam
22:14 < Dune_linux> I guess the solution is to put -std=c99 somewhere in bam
22:16 < Oy> or try now
22:17 < Dune> ouch, my console editor is bugging out and I don't know how to handle vim 
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lol Dune ur right there is some dark magic
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it actually looks at the + and executes it twice xd
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> any reason for this?
22:21 < Dune_linux> g++: error: unrecognized command line option '--c99'
22:21 < Dune_linux> huh
22:23 < Dune_linux> src/base/system.c: In function 'thread_sleep': src/base/system.c:512:2: warning: implicit declaration of function 'usleep' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]   usleep(milliseconds*1000);
22:23 < Dune_linux> what the hell are those errors
22:23 < minus> wtf are you doing
22:24 < minus> the switch for c99 should be -std=c99
22:24 < Dune> yeah, I changed to that, but now there are more errors in system.c
22:25 < Oy> don't need that switch
22:26 < Dune> what else do you suggest?
22:26 < Oy> just pull ;)
22:27 < Dune_linux> src/base/hash_libtomcrypt.c:179:5: error: 'for' loop initial declarations are only allowed in C99 or C11 mode      for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
22:27 < Dune> missed one I guess
22:28 < Oy> oh
22:28 < Oy> now
22:29 < Dune> works
22:30 < Oy> goodie
22:34 < Dune> done
22:34 < Dune> uploading
22:36 < Dune> onto testing
22:36 < Oy> win up too
22:36 < Oy> shows some warning sign for the linux ones?
22:37 < Dune> I'll rebuild to make sure
22:38 < Dune> no warnings
22:38 < Oy> maybe during uploading sth went wrong?
22:38 < Dune> ah, on github
22:38 < Oy> yeah
22:38 < Dune> well it is still uploading
22:38 < Dune> i think that's why
22:38 < Oy> or is it just me?
22:38 < Oy> ah ok
22:39 < Oy> u have some slow internet :D
22:39 < Dune> I'm in the middle of a dense city and all my neighbors have fiber
22:39 < Dune> my flat owners decided fiber is not useful in any way and refused free install
22:40 < Oy> lol
22:42 < Dune> upload complete
22:42 < Dune> I can't start x86 on 64 bit linux, I don't remember whether it is normal, probably is
22:42 < Dune> 64 bit works fine
22:43 < Dune> 32 bit server also works fine
22:43 < Dune> I guess the graphical libraries are the problem somehow
22:44 < Oy> probably
22:45 < Dune> Steam depends on heinrich5991
22:47 < Dune> i tested translations, they're up to date
22:49 < Oy> mac up
22:49 < Oy> yeah
22:49 < Dune> nice
22:49 < Oy> need news posts too
22:49 < Dune> yeah
22:53 < Dune> I was hoping to get a banner this time around as well, no artists around unfortunately
22:53 < Oy> :(
22:53 < Oy> something with easter would have been nice
22:54 < Dune> yeah
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> summoning @android272 @Sonix @Zatline

22:57 < Dune> in that case, tomorrow morning
23:01 < Oy> yeah
23:01 < Dune> need to close the milestone too btw
23:03 < Oy> done
23:04 < Dune> I'll write up tonight and read tomorrow morning, usually I scrap half of what I write when reading it after some sleep :D
23:05 < Oy> :D
23:07 < Dune> potentially first release without bugs
23:07 < Oy> bugs are always around :P
