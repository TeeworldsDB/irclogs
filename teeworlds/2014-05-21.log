17:42 < DoctorTee> Hi
17:42 < Siile> hi doc
17:43 < DoctorTee> Hi
17:46 <@minus> matricks: you released the new order?
18:00 < DoctorTee> Simple question : what are the requierements to compile teeworlds on linux ?
18:00 < DoctorTee> The packages...
18:03 < DoctorTee> Nobody ?
19:12 < heinrich5991> DoctorTee: sdl and a compiler
20:48 < heinrich5991> when snaps get lost, it could happen that stuff like chat messages get attributed to the wrong player.
20:48 < heinrich5991> matricks: is there an obvious fix for that?
22:34 < heinrich5991> ï·º
22:35 < heinrich5991> can someone's client display this? :)
22:37 <@matricks> heinrich5991: what? they can?
22:41 < heinrich5991> well
22:41 < heinrich5991> if snaps get lost while chat is coming through
22:41 < heinrich5991> then the server and client have different opinions about what players are on which ID
22:42 < heinrich5991> or am I missing something?
