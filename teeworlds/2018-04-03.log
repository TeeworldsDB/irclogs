00:14 < breton> why do you care lol
00:14 < breton> less load to your servers
01:59 < pinkieval> breton: because his server's gameplay is shit
02:02 < pinkieval> and I don't really care about my servers' load, they all have a CPU load next to 0
02:03 < pinkieval> I even run BOINC on one of them
02:08 < pinkieval> the only bottleneck is being able to handle DoS attacks again teeworlds
02:22 < breton> pinkieval: well, his gameplay is just single-player oriented. Humans rarely team up and everyone wants to be a superhero killing tens of zombies
02:40 < pinkieval> exactly
02:50 < breton> pinkieval: but that's the reason why it is popular and good. You don't have to depend on noobbing and lagging teammates.
02:54 < pinkieval> very true
02:54 < pinkieval> and that would explain why the most skilled players stopped playing infclass
