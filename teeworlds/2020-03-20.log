09:58 < Learath2> I created a bugreport upstream https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5046 hopefully they'll fix it so we don't have to work around it
10:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> doesnt seem to be possible to upvote issues on bugzilla hm?
10:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wait u even provided a patch? nice
10:46 < Dune> That's great, Learath2. Does this cover https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1659 though? Should probably link the bugzilla ticket there if it does :)
10:47 < Dune> the ticket seems to be specifically about the crash though
11:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> @LordSk https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2499
11:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> can u describe exactly how it should look?
11:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> oh
11:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> i think this issue is fixed already
11:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/690504479753240606/unknown.png
11:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> here it has the right border
11:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah the right border should not be clipped
11:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> but its already fixed
11:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> isnt it?
11:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hum well I did not do anything in that regard, let me check
11:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it is still broken on my end, what window/screen resolution do you use ?
11:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> i am on arch linux using i3-gaps resolution is 1080
11:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/690505959155564604/unknown.png
11:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> this is how all looks
11:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> how about the history tab?
11:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/690506093788397608/unknown.png
11:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> huh.
11:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> u can notice tho
11:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> right border is smaller
11:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> than left
11:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yes but that could be a number of things
11:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I don't pixel align borders for example
11:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/690506486895476756/unknown.png
11:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> looks like that for me
11:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> (linux 1080)
11:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> i am compiling with cmake and ninja btw g++ is ```g++ -v

11:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> well thank you for your report, I did not expect to have a different behaviours on different machines
11:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> maybe pixel aligning fixes it
11:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I use the same resolution as you and so does @Dune, so I doubt it would fix it
11:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> do u see the right border if u set editor2.cpp line 1647 1 to 4?
11:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yes
11:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/690509306495369217/unknown.png
11:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> isnt that a floating value thing
11:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I mean it definitely worked at some point, I just don't know when I broke it
11:38 < Dune> looks like subpixels
11:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> left border looks bigger
11:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/690509810990448700/unknown.png
11:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> i think on my end too
11:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I think this is a scroll region issue to be honest
11:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and I may have broken it when I updated the editor's scrollregion code to match the teeworlds one
11:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> :o
12:41 < Learath2> @LordSk do you mind if I do a couple things with the editor? I know some people don't like contributors on major rewrites like these so wanted to ask
12:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Learath2: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2486
12:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> TL;DR: as long as you make an issue first and we agree on it, you can totally contribute
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yo guis @AkaFad had the idea to collect some tw history and create a timeline image. So i quickly spun up a simple github repo where we are currently collecting some dates of tw historic events. If you want to contribute feel free to pullrequest or ping me and ill happily give you push access https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/history/blob/master/timeline.md
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might add the reason why it was renamed to teeworlds, it was some copyright/brand name claim, I guess
