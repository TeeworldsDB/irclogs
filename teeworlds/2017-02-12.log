20:09 < WASD> hei
20:11 < Obani> hei
20:11 < Obani> cool name you got there
20:14 < WASD> thx ik c:
20:15 < WASD> so eeeehm, i got a tw server ... and it was running just fine, then at some point it couldn't find any masterservers anymore.
20:15 < WASD> some idea why?
20:29 < quatria> other people were able to join your server and then suddenly not anymore?
20:30 < quatria> or can people still join your server but it doesnt show up on the server list?
20:31 < Obani> WASD, sometimes teeworlds's master server gets DDOSed :)
20:31 < WASD> ye but they're not down atm :o i can find all ~900 servers but not mine
20:32 < Obani> WASD, tried restarting your server ?
20:32 < quatria> does the server log say that it has problems to connect to the master servers?
20:33 < WASD> hmn ye i could do that, but i would lose all players :I 
20:33 < WASD> WARNING: No master servers. Retrying in 60 seconds
20:33 < WASD> this appears all the time
20:33 < Obani> WASD, if there are no players, this shouldn't happend
20:36 < WASD> what?
20:36 < quatria> i also dont understand Obani ^^
20:36 < WASD> so i have to have no players so this won't happen? ._.
20:36 < Obani> well check in your logs if there are any players
20:36 < Obani> you won't loose any if you don't have any
20:36 < WASD> there are actually players, yes
20:37 < Obani> ok so
20:37 < Obani> That's a problem
20:37 < WASD> yup
20:37 < quatria> what you mean Obani, if you have players you cant connect to the master servers anymore?
20:38 < Obani> read me again
20:40 < WASD> i still don't get it ._.
20:40 <@minus> is everything kill?
20:40 < WASD> what do u mean everything kill? o.o
20:40 < quatria> read him again !
20:41 < WASD> oooh ok he meant when i have no players, i won't lose players
20:42 < quatria> so its better to have no players, than to lose 2 players and then have no players?
20:42 < quatria> still makes no sense :P
20:43 < WASD> well but i still have around 40 players ^^ because they joined before the server lost the connection to the masterserver
20:43 < WASD> and i still don't get minus ._.
20:44 <@minus> hi
20:44 < quatria> minus is just trying to increase the confusness, dont let him poisen your mind
20:44 <@minus> i'm as confused as you are
20:44 < quatria> lol
20:44 <@minus> teeworlds downloads are kill
20:44 <@minus> cause my server is kill
20:44 <@minus> i was wondering if anything else was kill
20:45 < WASD> oh so u didn't talk to me ^^
20:46 < quatria> so servers just lose connection to the master servers and then cant connect back, only by restarting?
20:46 < WASD> seems so :I
20:49 < quatria> oh thats sad
21:20 < Obani> WASD, is this a block server ?
21:26 < WASD> ye
21:27 < Obani> That's why
21:31 < WASD> how is that a reason?
21:32 < Obani> you can't close your server
21:32 < Obani> there will be people for days
21:34 < WASD> well just restarted it, and made them join again :D
21:34 < Obani> Did it work ?
21:35 < Obani> For master server
21:35 < WASD> yep, works fine again
21:35 < Obani> cuwl
21:35 < WASD> well still thanks for ur help :D i'm out, bb
21:36 < Obani> WASD, well probably figure out another solution later :p
21:37 < WASD> hmh i may come back tomorrow and try to find out
21:37 < Obani> What's your server ?
21:37 < WASD> you know the google servers?
21:37 < Obani> no
21:37 < WASD> start tw ... search for the most popular blocker servers ... that's mine ^^
21:40 < Obani> Chile ?
21:40 < WASD> eeeeh nah the one under it ._.
21:40 < Obani> :p
21:42 < WASD> ok but thx again see you :D
