19:23 < day> is it intentional that selecting a weapon that you dont have will lead to a weapon switch when you pick it up?
19:24 < day> e.g. i press 3 without having a shotgun. then pick one up (a few seconds later) and it will be drawn out due to the previous action.
19:47 < Oy> day: settings->general->"switch weapon on pickup"
20:12 < rand> there is a field like wanted_weapon somewhere
20:14 < rand> Oy: disable this option, spawn, select grenade, (nothing happens), pickup grenade -> auto switch to grenade
20:14 < rand> i guess it is a feature
20:15 < rand> (I want this :p)
20:33 < Oy> yeah
21:59 < day> 'feature'
