00:14 < day> was the hook physic changed between 2016 and now? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8iZwxoAFTg 
00:15 < day> i cant get this initial setup to work at all. i cant stretch the hook like he does. neither do i get high enough to swing around the corner
00:18 <@Dune> I reproduced it and had to use my nose to hit print screen
00:18 <@Dune> however, I realized later that teeworlds defaults to f10
00:18 < day> you did?
00:20 <@Dune> nah, just the first part :|
00:23 <@Dune> :P
00:47 < Fudgy> day nothing changed, I can still do it just as fine as before, you probably just need practice
00:48 < day> k
00:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I played that CTF5 FastCap on 0.7. I don't feel any differences : P I made very simillar times
14:21 < nameless_tee54> Teeslayer?
14:21  * nameless_tee54 slaps TeeSlayer around a bit with a large fishbot
20:29 < TeeSlayer> Is it a know issue that servers running the same map for a very long time (like 30 days or so) experience issues such as delayed/slow laser shots and laggy animated backgrounds?
20:29 < TeeSlayer> it only disappears upon changing the map
20:30 < Ryozuki> ddnet fixed delayed lasers not long ago
20:30 <@Dune> this is 0.7
20:30 < TeeSlayer> s/know/known
20:31 <@Dune> there was an issue with lasers but I think it was fixed in 0.7.2 or 0.7.1
20:31 <@Dune> so it might be something with timers
20:32 <@Dune> laggy how, it stutters?
20:32 < TeeSlayer> yes, i've noticed that on Copy Love Box
20:32 < TeeSlayer> I already restarted the server though
