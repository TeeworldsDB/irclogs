18:26 < Pathos> Anybody happen to know how to host no-grenades Teerace server? I have grenade Teerace server, but I don't know how to host hook-only Teerace.
18:43 < green_snow> hello, how can I set a debug watchpoint in my modified Teeworlds source?
19:44 < heinrich5991> Pathos: no idea
19:45 < heinrich5991> have you checked the source code?
23:21 < Pathos> heinrich5991: No, but I probably should just ask Sushi haha
23:21 < Pathos> Hi foxlet 
23:21 < heinrich5991> Pathos: not sure how active sushi is
23:21 < Pathos> We communicate on e-mail no worries, thanks though heinrich5991 
23:21 < foxlet> Pathos: Hello.
23:21 < Pathos> Been bothering him too much
23:22 < heinrich5991> hey Pathos
23:22 < heinrich5991> I believe I haven't asked *you* yet
23:22 < heinrich5991> could you upload your downloadedmaps folder?
23:24 < Pathos> Sure
23:24 < Pathos> heinrich5991: 7z okay?
23:25 < heinrich5991> Pathos: anything is ok

23:26 <@minus> LZMA2 Ultra please :D
23:26 < Pathos> Here you go
23:26 < Pathos> heinrich5991: 
23:26 < Pathos> minus: haha, not sure if I know how to do that compression on 7z
23:27 <@minus> that should be available compression settings on the compression dialog
23:28 < Pathos> heinrich5991: is this for some government ultra secret project?
23:28 <@minus> haven't used 7-zip in ages though
23:28 <@minus> he's just collecting them
23:28 < Pathos> Oh, didn't know 7z comes with it
23:28 < Pathos> Collecting for what?
23:29 <@minus> hm, i don't know, maybe an archive
23:30 < heinrich5991> Pathos: collecting all TW maps in existence ;)
23:33 < Pathos> I try to clear my maps folder every now and then
23:33 < Pathos> Usually people in South America and Africa edit their maps a lot
23:34 < Pathos> Very annoying to download every time
23:36 < Pathos> minus: heinrich5991 what do you usually play?
23:37 <@minus> nothing
23:42 < heinrich5991> Pathos: not much right now, university! but if I play teeworlds, usually vanilla and ddrace
23:43 < foxlet> Usually this chat is silent, quite a twist today.
23:47 < Pathos> Mostly AFK
23:48 < foxlet> Ah.
23:48 < Pathos> foxlet: You play TW?
23:51 < foxlet> Pathos: Usually, no.
23:52 < foxlet> I dropped?
23:54 < foxlet> Pathos: I said no if you missed it.
23:56 < Pathos> No, you didn't drop, but you should totally play. :)
23:57 < foxlet> Pathos: I do plan to try it out more eventually.
23:57 < Pathos> foxlet: I actually got anti-bot server binary on your server
23:58 < Pathos> It's pretty interesting, recently picked it up, server written by unsigned char
23:58 < Pathos> Written/coded
23:58 < Pathos> Thought you might be interested maybe
23:58 < foxlet> Pathos: Right now Iâ€™m working on a new shiny server in the middle of Iowa. Part of the FurCode US/EU fleet.
23:59 < Pathos> EU or Europe? Do you have one in UK!?
23:59 < Pathos> Any reason for Iowa?
