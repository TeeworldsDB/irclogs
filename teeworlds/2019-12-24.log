02:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> Hey. I just wanted to know if there was any change to the Dynamic Cam. Sometimes it feels a bit like having low fps if you move your cursor up or down. Had this problem already on 0.7.3 and dont know if someone mention that.
03:29 < day> not sure i like the hats :P
03:30 < day> they cover the flags
03:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> basically hates christeemas ._.
03:41 < day> gift me things!
03:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *gifts more love, less hate*
03:44  * day believes theres a cultural misunderstanding :D
11:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 0.7 mouse sense is different than ddnet client 0.6 and since dyn is moved by the mouse this might cause a different feel
14:12 < Oy> heinrich5991: are u around?
14:33 < asm-debacle> there should be a visual effect covering part of your screen if your xmas-hat slips over your tee's eyes
14:34 < Dune> and it should deflect lasers :P
14:35 < asm-debacle> ok, make it bullet proof while you're at it
14:35 < Dune> why do lasers bounce on walls but not on tees
14:36 < asm-debacle> cause the walls are obviously covered with mirrors, duh
14:39 < asm-debacle> anyway, is anyone using windows and if so finding the initialization of the SDL joystick drivers a huge pita or is it just me
14:43 < Dune> you mean in Teeworlds?
14:44 < asm-debacle> yes
14:44 < Dune> keyword of experimental joystick support being experimental :D
14:45 < Dune> you need a specific kind of joystick in order to have enough buttons anyway :/
14:49 < asm-debacle> how would you feel about an option not to load the joystick subsystem, kinda like "load the sound system" (if that does what I think it does)
14:58 < Dune> The "load the sound system" option is there because it was a huge bottleneck to the loading of Teeworlds
14:58 < Dune> is the joystick loading significantly slow?
15:01 < asm-debacle> for me it's all over the place. *sometimes* it's not an issue but more often than not it takes anywhere between like 5 and 20 seconds, which is crazy when the entire game can start in 1 or 2 seconds max
15:02 < Dune> err :/  would make sense then. should open an issue
15:02 < asm-debacle> it looks like an SDL issue to me, but I couldn't find any reports like this on the net
15:03 < asm-debacle> so in my build I removed joystick loading entirely
15:03 < Dune> sounds like it
15:07 < asm-debacle> so what I don't know if this is exclusive to my system or if others might have the same issue
15:07 < Dune> possibly others have had the issue but did not realize
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> why no hat decorations in tw :'/
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> gib hat decoration!
15:34 < Oy> asm-debacle: you could try a newer sdl2 version
15:34 < Oy> you're on windows right?
15:39 < asm-debacle> Oy, win7, SDL 2.0.10
15:39 < asm-debacle> which ought to be the latest stable
15:40 < Oy> yeah
15:41 < Oy> we ship teeworlds with 2.0.8, but there're joystick fixes in newer versions, thought they might help
15:41 < Oy> then probably not
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Arseniy Zarche @LordSk ever got loading issues?
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i plug and enable joystick without any issues
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> or loadings
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> It’s been one year 0.7 now huh? And website front page still shows 0.6 screenshots hehe
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yep, one year since 0.7.2
23:12 <@heinrich5991> Oy: now am around :<
23:15 < Dune> don't think Oy is here :D
23:26 <@heinrich5991> ye, I timed it quite well…
