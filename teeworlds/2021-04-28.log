21:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.tsdo.nouis
21:07 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> what is gacha
21:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> gacha is basically lootboxes
21:08 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> in app purchases 2 bucks per item lmao
21:08 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> send moni i just melted my laptop xd
21:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> I made like 4 dollars in two month.
21:09 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> lit
21:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> Including ad revenue
21:09 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> how much time did u spend developing?
21:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> two weeks
21:10 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> how much taxes u pay?
21:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> 60%
21:10 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> how big is the cut to the teeworlds franchise?
21:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> actually no, 30%. Google takes 30% cuts tho.
21:11 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> totally worth it mate
21:11 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> sign me in
21:11 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i am a mobile teewoods dev now
21:11 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> what tools did u use? Unity?
21:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> at least I learned how to integrate with Google play store's stuff
21:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> so it's worth it. Might come in handy if I want to do more shameless stuff.
21:12 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> awesome
21:12 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i would use it
21:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> I quit unity last year. I used godot
21:12 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oh so is godot working fine for mobile stuff?
21:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> I guess
21:12 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> neat
21:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> looks fine for me at least
21:13 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> maybe I should actually give it a try
21:13 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> does it run on non android linux?
21:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> So Linux?
21:14 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> xd
21:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> I have Linux build on my itch page
21:14 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> well i have an apple phone i wanna test ur game tho
21:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> https://tsfreddie.itch.io/biggernouis
21:14 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i think i played it in web already
21:14 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ah ye that
21:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> Well I didn't build for ios
21:15 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ye ios is tricky ik
21:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> Well I can build it. But what's the point if don't want to spend a hundred bucks to put it in appstore
21:15 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> ye useless
21:15 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> crapstore
21:16 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i wonder how hard it is to install iOS apps not from the app store
21:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> probably not *that* hard now. Altstore exists
21:17 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> woot there are altstores?
21:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> It is literally called altstore
21:17 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> I thought more about plugging to a macbook and yeeting some xcode project onto the device
21:17 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> oh wow did not know
21:18 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> but ur app there
21:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> You still need a PC or Mac to sign the apps you want to install tho
21:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> Altstore does it automatically and remotely on your computer.
21:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> still, pretty tedious
