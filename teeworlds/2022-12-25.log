00:58 < minus> https://a.uguu.se/yXvqQnrP.png yeahâ€¦
01:16 < minus> i disabled registrations for now
10:12 < ChillerDragon> whats uguu.se? xd
11:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Teeman (FriskGT)> hello
11:52 < minus> a temporary image host, ChillerDragon
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we could drop the pre-moderation for posts pretty soon, minus
15:25 < minus> yes
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Xen> Did you finally consider to add a Discord invite link to the forum?
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Xen https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12576
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I haven't heard of any suggestions to advertise it elsewhere
17:40 < minus> should be on the contact page alongside irc. matrix too
17:40 < minus> it's in the repo anyway, just need to edit it
17:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Xen> it should be like really prominent on the main page
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Teeworlds communities should meet in their own discord though, this is more of a development thing which doesn't need frontpage advertisement
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It's too much work to organize all the type of community stuff here, and I don't think people *want* that anyway
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> can it really be development if oy isn't really present here?
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> and by "really" I mean at all
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> no matter how poorly it's going, the only thing that makes sense to be going on here is the development is what I meant to say
