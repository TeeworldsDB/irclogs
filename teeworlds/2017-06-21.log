10:27 < foxlet> matricks: Hey! I just wanted to ask if the macOS build is broken in the latest download.
10:27 < foxlet> The SDL library isnâ€™t being found when launching under macOS Sierra.
10:36 < foxlet> And from what I can tell, the reference is for @rpath/SDL.framework/Versions/A/SDL but there is no actual LC_RPATH in the binary for it to expand?
10:41 <@minus> the mac build is somewhat difficult; i think heinrich5991 took care of building the last release, he might know more
