01:00 < bridge_> [freenode] <Choscura> hey, is this a thing?
01:01 < bridge_> [freenode] <Choscura> I've just found this game and have my kids playing a lan game from a pi hosting this
01:01 < Dune> Choscura: yeah it's still a thing!
01:02 < Dune> runs well on pi i heard :)
01:02 < bridge_> [freenode] <Choscura> cool! where do i find the server commands to put it on the next map?
01:02 < bridge_> [freenode] <Choscura> well the game *technically* runs but it's unplayably slow
01:02 < bridge_> [freenode] <Choscura> but as a server, it's not too bad
01:02 < Dune> ah, well yeah, as a server only
01:02 < Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=server_setup
01:02 < bridge_> [freenode] <Choscura> thanks dude!
01:02 < Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=server_settings
01:03 < Dune> if you want to change map it's just `sv_map`
01:03 < Dune> there are also large collections of server modifications, like races, grenade only, laser only... :)
01:10 < bridge_> [freenode] <Choscura> shit, sounds like I need to read up on the forum about this stuff :D
01:16 < Dune> you can even train your kids to fight off a zombie apocalypse: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12646 ;)
14:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yo fstd does ur pstd server restart on crash automatically or how do you get the nice uptime? My fork crashes every 2 days :/
15:48 < redix> Can we increase the range for the score in the scoreboard? Gametypes with saved stats can exceed the 999 easily (see zcatch). All other UI elements don't have a clamp for the score anyway
16:22 < day> yeah im running into that issue frequently on ctf as well
16:22 < day> when im solo stomping the enemy team (so every day)
16:23 < day> i blame it on chiller though for introducing the killing spree feature
16:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd
16:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> noob farmer. Do u srsly get over 1k kills in 1 ctf pub round? o.O
18:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's a human issue, not a vanilla issue.
18:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *cough end*
18:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> if you spawnkill the enemy team enough it's fairly easy to win
20:16 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> Teeworlds has github Actions now?! Should i do a quick pr for each OS
20:16 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> ?
20:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Please do
20:37 < Oy> sure
20:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @𝓔𝓼𝓼𝓲𝓰𝓪𝓾𝓽𝓸𝓶𝓪𝓽 if I remember correctly there was a security issue @heinrich5991 mentioned?
21:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2194#issuecomment-531283941
21:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Wait, is this related?
21:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> no
21:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> 😄
22:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune there is a different between CI and CD pipeline, currently teeworlds only has a CI pipeline
22:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm
22:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> not much of a difference to me; CD also provides the built binaries
22:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> isn't that a difference? 😄
22:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yea
22:40 < redix> Are gamer client and zillywoods based on master?
22:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> you mean current master vs 0.7.3.1?
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> both
22:50 < redix> Yes. All demos recorded with master are broken/incompatible with 0.7.3
22:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> redix: yes they both messed demos up
22:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> we know that
22:50 < redix> I could create a tool to fix them =\
22:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> that would be nice 🙂
22:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but since they still can be watched not too big of a deal
22:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rather spend your time to create a tool to fix my 0.6 demos that are not watchable by any client
22:52 < redix> Well you can't watch them with 0.7.4 
22:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> because the wrong map is loaded into the demo file
22:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well as far as i know the only person who could care about the demos being broken is informed and ok with it
22:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but sure if you want to build a tool would be nice
22:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but coud be that nobody ever needs it
22:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> sorry for that PR, i fucked up
23:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> github actions: `md build32 & cd build32`
23:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> error, build32 doesn't exist
23:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> missing newline on end of file btw
23:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> wtf, on push on masterbranch is working
23:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> but not on pull_request
23:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/AssassinTee/teeworlds/actions
23:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> any ideas?
23:16 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it doesn't show pushes on closed PRs IIRC
23:23 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> i think i just remove it
23:23 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> for now
