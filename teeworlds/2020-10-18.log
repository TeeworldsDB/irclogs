09:33 < ChillerDragonTL> Disagree. Tw is nice as it is gameplay wise.
09:43 < ChillerDragon> oh btw @Zatline nice to see you around again you seem so active. Thought you quitted before I started playing. Anyways will you teach me to become a tw gfx guru? I cracked together a svg tileset w inkscape and dont know how to export it as png xd
09:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i saw your svg on the ddnet discord server, looks good.
09:56 < ChillerDragon> :3
09:57 < ChillerDragon> i like ur rainbow in the name :)
09:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :P
09:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I'm banned on ddnet discord tho
09:57 < ChillerDragon> oof why
09:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I asked for a role, some admin gave me music bot role without realizing that only has access to voice-text channel
09:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> so i'm blocked from all channels other than that one
09:59 < ChillerDragon> xd
09:59 < ChillerDragon> "banned" i see
09:59 < ChillerDragon> im blocked from all other channels than #developer
10:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> yeah, but #developer is more active i think. admins doesn't check channel often i suppose. i've been chatting there with louis for a day now.
10:44 < ChillerDragon> can u spot the bone that I made vs the original? I bet u cant :p https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1603010536.png
10:50 < Oy> ChillerDragon: there's a menu on the right "export PNG image"(should show up with ctrl+shift+e). there you can select what should be exported, the final image size etc. at the end hit the "export" button with the green checkmark
10:51 < ChillerDragon> Yea i tried ctrl+shift+e but it always trys to export the smallest possible solution
10:52 < Oy> you have to define the area that should be exportet on top
10:52 < ChillerDragon> im scared
10:52 < ChillerDragon> oh wow u can select page and then it uses the 1024x1024 xd
10:53 < ChillerDragon> thanks Oy
10:54 < ChillerDragon> that went unexpected well https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1603011153.png
10:54 < ChillerDragon> seems like i cant spot a single off pixel in gimp
10:54 < ChillerDragon> Can we go open svg if I provide a remake of grass_doodads? :D Oy
10:55 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/mapres/blob/master/svg/grass_doodads_chiller.svg
11:19 < Oy> doubt that, though you can publish your svg like u want :D
11:24 < ChillerDragon> yea thought so
11:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> u should use grids on inkscape
11:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> that way u can align stuff better
12:05 < ChillerDragon> I use grids thats how I managed to align them like a tileset @Sonix and I used guides for the trees so that they can be combined
12:06 < ChillerDragon> @Sonix btw it still makes me nervous that your new tree uses a different approach to shadowing :/
12:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i didnt add any new tree
12:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> nor i did touch grass doodads like ever
12:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> and its not different approach to shadowing just that case never happened before, and you should ask someone else
12:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> and its alright
12:39 < ChillerDragonTL> Oh I thought I saw you in the commit history

15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> bam content should create a map folder in data, am I right?
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> nevermind, shouldn't start from root dir, but from build folder
