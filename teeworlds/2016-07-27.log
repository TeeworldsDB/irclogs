20:08 < magneticduck> having a hard time building teeworlds from sourde
20:08 < magneticduck> source*
20:09 <@minus> are you using windows?
20:09 < magneticduck> I'm just trying to get scripts/compile.py working
20:09 < magneticduck> on linux
20:09 <@minus> hm
20:09 < magneticduck> it's telling me that it's not finding the bam compile target
20:09 <@minus> using this? https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything
20:09 < magneticduck> neither server_release nor client_release
20:09 < magneticduck> I'll check that
20:10 <@minus> bam conf=release client
20:10 <@minus> that guide should be updated
20:11 < magneticduck> release_client?
20:11 < magneticduck> not client_release? that's what mentioned in the helpfile for compile.py itself
20:11 < magneticduck> I can double check it though
20:12 <@minus> `bam conf=release client` is the invocation
20:13 < magneticduck> great, that works
20:13 < magneticduck> compile.py was throwing me off
20:14 < magneticduck> boy it builds quick
20:14 < magneticduck> I mean, wow
20:15 <@minus> did you run it with -j?
20:15 < magneticduck> this is what happens when your codebase isn't full of complex template libraries and boost
20:15 <@minus> that makes it even faster
20:15 < magneticduck> haha I didn't even run it threaded
20:15 <@minus> oh right
20:15 <@minus> never noticed it compiles so fast although it's C++
20:16 < magneticduck> my own project takes 7 minutes of system time to compile, 2.5 minutes on my multicore development box
20:16 < magneticduck> and it's only 17k lines...
20:17 <@minus> a game?
20:17 < magneticduck> yeah
20:18 < magneticduck> oh well, this is what I pay for being a weak-willed, pathetic developer who uses large thirdparty libraries for things I should be NIHing
20:23 <@minus> so, what's your game?
20:24 <@minus> !seen matricks
20:24 < Nimda3> I've last seen matricks 36 days, 23 hours, 26 minutes and 5 seconds ago in #teeworlds saying "I call it bullshit".
20:24 < magneticduck> http://solemnsky.com
20:25 <@minus> huh, they renamed altitude?
20:25 < magneticduck> unreleased, GPLv3, multiplayer, just me developing it
20:25 <@minus> cool cool
20:25 < magneticduck> are you thinking about planeball.com?
20:25 <@minus> yeah
20:25 < magneticduck> that's a community effort
20:25 <@minus> again?
20:25 < magneticduck> related to the ranked server system we have
20:25 <@minus> oh, i thought it was dead again
20:26 < magneticduck> altitude has always been alive
20:26 <@minus> not the first version
20:26 < magneticduck> not sure if you heard the news, but the devs just abandoned it and made it F2P
20:26 < magneticduck> now we have a few people doing different things to keep the tradition alive
20:26 < magneticduck> solemnsky is by far the most radical ^^
20:29 < magneticduck> I've also had fun decompiling / injecting into the server; it's java, so it's fairly easy to add little features here and there
20:31 < magneticduck> minus: I don't know what you're referring to as the first version of altitude
20:34 <@minus> https://sr.ht/sQsz.png this one
20:34 < magneticduck> oh my
20:34 <@minus> played that shit around 2004
20:35 < magneticduck> so altitude's been out over 12 years now
20:35 < magneticduck> I actually didn't know that, I only know about the 2009 release
20:36 < kidanger> the chat hasn't changed much
20:38 < magneticduck> how so
20:39 < magneticduck> minus: anyway altitude is alive, we have ranked games every GMT afternoon
20:39 < magneticduck> hey, sometimes they aren't even that lousy
20:40 <@minus> about and blog on your site don't work, magneticduck?
20:41 < magneticduck> oh yeah, our marketing is on low-power mode
20:42 <@minus> got screens or something?
20:44 < magneticduck> not a whole lot to see besides some UIs and planes flying around bare-bone maps
20:48 <@minus> uh, git submodules
20:48 < magneticduck> oh you're pulling it?
20:48 < magneticduck> yeah, I love me some submodules
20:49 <@minus> they're scary
20:50 < magneticduck> there was at least one point that I got fed up and `cd .. ; rm -rf $OLDPWD ; git clone --recursive ..`'d
20:54 <@minus> heh
20:54 <@minus> building finished, 3m18s (4 threads)
20:54 < magneticduck> sounds about right
20:55 < magneticduck> for some reason, on Windows (with MinGW) it can take up to 1.5 minutes just to link the client
20:55 < magneticduck> I.. just don't know why
20:55 < magneticduck> oh, maybe we can play on the remote server
20:56 < magneticduck> yeah, click the home page and then 'remote'
20:56 <@minus> solemnsky/../../media/fonts/Roboto-Light.ttf ← that file obviously doesn't exist
20:57 < magneticduck> oh right
20:57 < magneticduck> you have to run it from a directory two levels deep into the repo
20:57 < magneticduck> *cough*
20:57 <@minus> why would you…
20:57 < magneticduck> it's just an option made out of convenience, I'm actually about to change that
20:57 < magneticduck> because I build in dist/debug
20:57 < magneticduck> and well, I'm lazy
20:58 <@minus> teeworlds build into build/amd64/debug and you need to run it from the main directory
20:58 <@minus> runs now :)
20:59 < magneticduck> oh my, I think my friend broke the server
21:00 < magneticduck> out of curiosity, see what happens when you join the server now
21:01 <@minus> so, have you got some irc channel?
21:02 < magneticduck> we have a slack group
21:02 <@minus> eww
21:03 < magneticduck> it's like IRC, but closed-source, centralized and evil
21:03 < magneticduck> uh I mean, it has more features
21:03 <@minus> i know slack
21:04 <@minus> i just think it's a bad thing for open source projects to use it
21:05 <@minus> https://drewdevault.com/2015/11/01/Please-stop-using-slack.html
21:05 <@minus> enough slack hating. how do you start a game?
21:06 < magneticduck> reading through that, I admittedly haven't given any consideration to the cons of slack 
21:06 < magneticduck> hm, I would like to know how one starts a game
21:07 <@minus> you don't know how to hop ingame in your own game?
21:07 < magneticduck> (arguably at this point slack's benefits of persistent logs, file management etc far outweigh the cons of walled-gardens -- we only have about 8 people in the group)
21:07 < magneticduck> oh right, I thought you were asking a more general question
21:08 < magneticduck> `/auth` to become an admin and then `/start` to start the game on the programmed map
21:08 < magneticduck> s/map/environment
21:09 < magneticduck> in the sandbox, type `start funnelpark`
21:11 <@minus> got a very similar feel as the original altitude :D
21:11 < magneticduck> what, the crappy graphics?
21:11 <@minus> i like the old graphics better
21:12 <@minus> the game runs at about 15 fps for me btw
21:12 < magneticduck> `start demo`
21:12 < magneticduck> see how it works with that
21:12 < magneticduck> also enable debug mode for performance stats
21:15 <@minus> cycle:18ms
21:16 < magneticduck> that sure isn't 15 FPS
21:16 <@minus> oh, after starting desktop compositing it runs smoothly
21:17 < magneticduck> interesting
21:17 < magneticduck> graphics on linux are always interesting
21:17 <@minus> X11/intel being fucky as always
21:17 < magneticduck> recently I had a bug where the client freezes the *entire OS* every like, 45 minutes
21:17 < magneticduck> I had to do a hard reboot, everything was locked down to networking
21:17 <@minus> X11 freezing is nothing surprising…
21:18 < magneticduck> anyway, it seems to work fine in fullscreen mode
21:22 < magneticduck> hehe, teeworlds has an error message that reads 'out of ideas. failed to init graphics'
21:22 < magneticduck> I presume that happens when the client isn't feeling inspired
21:30  * magneticduck briefly daydreams about rewriting solemnsky in Haskell
21:31 < magneticduck> writing this game served as my hasty introduction to the wonderful world of C++
