12:40 < ChillerDragon> yo redix r u axblk?
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
12:40 < ChillerDragon> leak
12:41 < ChillerDragon> then thanks for the review of my demo cutting pr redix <3 most of the things I was thinking about my self but i lack skills to implement them. Would be nice if you could send fixes if u want to.
13:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I dont have too much time at the moment. Actually the demo recorder and player are not really designed for this purpose... for example directly copying the map from the source demo would end up really ugly with the current interface =\
13:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> But i'll try to look into it within the next weeks
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2649
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> heartbleed bug?
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I didn't see a way to exfiltrate the data
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I guess just checking that Type is never larger than 64 would fix that
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> IIUIC that would also break extended types or other possible extensions of the snapshot items
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah no?
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> dunno
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> hm I wonder how I actually missed this while debugging snapshots, the client seems to drop these types anyway, but I guess it relies on UB
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Is there a specific reason other clients information is updated before the local one?
18:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Is there a specific reason other clients information is sent before the local one?
