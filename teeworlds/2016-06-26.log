12:40 < Obani> Hey
12:41 <@heinrich5991> hey
12:42 < Obani> heinrich5991, I discovered using for the first time Vanilla servers the mapchecker. Is there a way to disable it or to "brain-fuck" it ?
12:42 < Obani> Also do you know where in the source code is it located ?
12:44 <@heinrich5991> Obani: what's the problem? you should only host the original maps with the names dm* ctf*
12:45 < Obani> heinrich5991, the problem is I would like to add a ninja powerup to ctf maps to include them in DM/TDM modes
12:45 < Obani> Using the same names
12:46 <@heinrich5991> you're not allowed to do that under the same name :)
12:46 < Obani> :/
12:46 < Obani> Not for standard maps...
12:47 < Obani> I don't understand why would it be forbidden for such a trivial change
12:48 < rand> official map are supposed not to be altered
12:48 < EastBite> your change is not trivial at all
12:48 < Obani> Let me explain my point of vue
12:49 < BotoX> Obani: you can alter the source code of the server to allow for that addition
12:49 < Obani> The problem is I want to make them more DM/TDM-like
12:49 < BotoX> since it is just an entity spawnpoint for the server
12:49 < Obani> BotoX, I know, but I want to know first if there's a legit way :p
12:49 < BotoX> that's the only "legit way"
12:49 < Obani> But IF I do that
12:49 < BotoX> so the clients won't complain
12:50 < EastBite> the banmaster though
12:50 < Obani> It might not work on the server or it will not be displayed by most of the users (because non-standard maps aren't allowed)
12:50 <@heinrich5991> yes :(
12:50 < BotoX> no, use the vanilla map
12:50 <@heinrich5991> that's probably the bad rule
12:50 < BotoX> make a console command to spawn weapon entities on x y position
12:50 < BotoX> then make mapconfigs that will be executed when that map loads
12:50 < BotoX> and use that command to add the entities
12:51 < Obani> Is it possible ?
12:51 < BotoX> it is possible
12:51 < BotoX> the client doesn't need to know about the entities in the map
12:51 < EastBite> and be banned for running a modded server as vanilla
12:51 < BotoX> noone will care if he adds one or two more ninja spawns
12:51 <@heinrich5991> if someone notices
12:51 < BotoX> ^
12:51 < Obani> EastBite, the mod is a modification for the good
12:52 < Obani> When I see all those Vanilla servers
12:52 < Obani> There is so much of nothing
12:52 < Obani> It's a huge amount of void
12:52 < Obani> They just have the basic config and didn't try anything to enhance it
12:52 < BotoX> overdoing it might be fun at first
12:52 < BotoX> but it'll get boring quicker
12:52 < BotoX> keep that in mind
12:52 < Obani> BotoX, it's not overdoing
12:52 < Obani> at all
12:53 < BotoX> well yeah I don't know what you are planning to do, just telling you to keep it in mind :p
12:53 < Obani> overdoing it would be to add votes to change weapons gravity, to change lazer lenght...
12:53 < Obani> I just want to add ninjas to ctf maps that could have one in TDM/DM modes
12:53 < Obani> But if I'm unabled to do that...
12:54 < BotoX> As I said it is very possible
12:54 < Obani> The problem is that there's no way to make a popular server for newbies without going a bit out of the really s=restricted way of Vanilla
12:54 < Obani> And Vanilla modes are not really played by old players
12:55 < BotoX> let me just find where entities are spawned, been a while since I've looked at the teeworlds code
12:56 < BotoX> ah, alright
12:56 < BotoX> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/0.6/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L1518
12:56 < BotoX> here, this is where the server goes through all the map tiles and spawns an entity if it finds one
12:57 < BotoX> so you have to make a console command that calls m_pController->OnEntity(entity_index, Vec2(x, y));
12:57 < BotoX> and then in your mapconfig
12:58 < BotoX> you call that command with the correct index and position
12:58 < BotoX> to spawn an entity at that position on mapload
12:58 < BotoX> no need to modify the map so clients won't complain
12:58 < Obani> or https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds/blob/master/src/versionsrv/mapversions.h :3
12:59 < BotoX> that's a client-side check....
12:59 < Obani> damn
13:00 < BotoX> the other way would be to fake the CRC of your map
13:00 < Obani> Well I think I'll stop that...
13:00 < Obani> There's no way to make it interesting excepted if you accept to be maybe banned some day...
13:01 < Obani> And it's much time to investigate...
13:01 < rand> are non standard map filtered by default on client ?
13:02 < Obani> Yes of course
13:02 < Obani> As non-standard modes (it's more understandable for mods)
13:02 < rand> why of course ?
13:02 < Obani> Because it's non-standard ?
13:03 <@heinrich5991> rand: because otherwise server owners could more easily patch out the server-side check :)
13:05 < rand> ? how is it easier when not filtered on browser list ?
13:06 < rand> (i'm missing something obvious, i 'm afraid ^^)
13:18 < Obani> Don't you think it would be good to promote some client-side mods on teeworlds homepage ?
13:42 < needs1> Obani, why not just name your map ctfx_ninja ?  Even if new players wont see your server because this is not a standard map I don't think it is that much of a problem, and new players usually figure out pretty quickly how to show modded servers as well
13:43 < needs1> I used to run a server with custom ctf_map and most of the player were new
13:57 < Obani> needs1, Do I really need to change the name completely for one ninja entity added ?
13:58 < Obani> Or better
13:58 < Obani> I'll completely adapt the maps and rename them
13:58 < Obani> And add the ninja entity
13:58 < Obani> xD
14:05 < Obani> I'll start working on it soon
14:05 < Obani> I Sonix- sometimes coming there ?
