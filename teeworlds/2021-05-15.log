01:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Nouaa nice to see you contacted me with a fake discord profile so I will help you
01:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> keep the discussion here please, I wont react to your dms
09:51 < ChillerDragon> that sounds good @jxsl13 i will share that from now on when ppl ask me :)
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Iam currently working further on Catch64 and added ninja -  is there a way to deactivate the ninja skin on server side or is that client side? It's hard to search for code that you don't know of
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> okay it's [client sided](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/6c6a3a0bb39caff5af643fc369c5edef2bbd3be9/src/game/client/components/players.cpp#L443), but hope is not lost if I use custom-colors
18:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> There is no hope, every ninja gets the colors of the local client ninja for every ninja in the game
19:48 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> i think some users use a ninja skin that still renders colors
19:49 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> you can buy my client 0day to force ninja colors on your server :D
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> What is catch64
19:51 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> every tee starts with a random skin color. If you "kill" another tee they get ur color and are in your team. LMS color wins.
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> I see
19:52 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> its instagib and tees actually dont die but only change color irrc
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> I think I've accidentally made ninja white before
19:52 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> IIRC!
19:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> Didn't try if passing custom color info can make the white ninja colorful tho. And the way of glitching the ninja isn't exactly stable.
20:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> chillerdragon, i can change 1 line on client side, too, no need ^^
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> my internetprovider doesn't give a me an ipv4 and has his own NAT
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> how am I now RANDOMLY able to host servers again?!
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I didn't even open ports in the router ðŸ˜
