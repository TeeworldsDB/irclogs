16:22 < c0ffee_> when trying to build teeworlds, I get SDL.h not found error, on Ubuntu 14.04. Same as in this thread https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10949
16:23 < c0ffee_> what would be the way to fix it?
16:24 <@minus> install sdl-dev, remove .bam probably
16:30 < c0ffee_> installed libsdl1.2.dev , removed .bam directory, still same. Also i use '$ ../bam-0.4.0/bam ' , because '$ ../bam-0.4.0/bam debug' says 'bam: debug target not found'
