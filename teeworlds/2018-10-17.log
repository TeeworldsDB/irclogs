13:10 <@heinrich5991> minus: who hosts master2?
13:10 <@heinrich5991> it seems to report a low server register count which makes everyone register at master2 but then doesn't respond to register requests
13:10 <@heinrich5991> effectively emptying the whole server list
13:20 < koomi> uh that's me
13:20 <@heinrich5991> koomi: then please fix that ^^
13:21 <@heinrich5991> temporarily turning off the master works
13:21 <@heinrich5991> for the temporary fix
13:22 <@heinrich5991> hmmmm
13:23 <@heinrich5991> I think the other masters don't respond at all, but not sure
13:25 <@heinrich5991> koomi: ok, all masters seem to be downish, yours is the only one that responds to COUNT requests
13:25 <@heinrich5991> :(
13:25 < koomi> just restarted mine
13:26 <@heinrich5991> still doesn't work though. hmmmm
13:27 <@heinrich5991> this is probably some deeper problem :(
13:27 <@heinrich5991> thanks for the quick response though
13:27 < koomi> np, let me know if you need a tcpdump or something
13:28 <@heinrich5991> if you could provide one, that'd be awesome
13:28 <@heinrich5991> tell me when you're ready, then I'll start a server that wants to register at your master
13:30 < koomi> ok tcpdump is running
13:30 < koomi> ports 8300 and 8301
13:32 <@heinrich5991> koomi: ok, done
13:32 <@heinrich5991> please send the tcpdump via PM
13:35 < koomi> uh, it's 3gb
13:38 <@heinrich5991> probably the masters are being dos'ed
13:41 < koomi> indeed
13:41 <@heinrich5991> I should finally write these stupid https masters :/
13:45 < koomi> my hosters ddos protection stuff kicked in, probably that's why stuff doesn't work
14:04 <@heinrich5991> k. loading the file doesn't work on my computer
14:04 <@heinrich5991> OOM
14:12 < minus> :o
14:34 < koomi> Heh
21:52 < Kottizen> minus: I could take a snapshot of the VM if you want -- but for what purpose?
21:53 < Dune> compiling on mac I assume?
22:01 < minus> Kottizen: upgrading to buster
22:01 < minus> so that letsencrypt works again
22:02 < minus> for rolling back in case of failure to be precise
22:06 < Kottizen> minus: Ah! I don't think I can reliably take a snapshot without powering the system off, but I could do that, take the snapshot and then power it back on. Unfortunately not today, but I can tell you as soon as it's done. I guess it would then be enough for you to take a copy of the database and the uploaded files, if there's a gap between my snapshot and your upgrade.
22:07 < minus> you can't do online snapshots? D:
22:07 < Kottizen> Not without a very expensive ESXi license... :/
22:07 < Kottizen> (I think?)
22:07 < Kottizen> I'd have to look it up!
22:08 < minus> i guess i could do a "here goes nothing"
22:08 < minus> don't you want to run the upgrade? :D
22:08 < Kottizen> I could set a new, clean VPS, if you want...!
22:08 < Kottizen> (and keep the old for some period, to let you move everything over)
22:11 < minus> that's way too much effort
22:12 < minus> hm, it actually just needs webhosting, no fullblown linux system
