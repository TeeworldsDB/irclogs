16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is it possible to have a damage indicator at a specific position?
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so it doesnt fly to one point, but its static at a position?
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> i don't think so
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i think in 0.6 it was possible
16:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Where in the server code are events removed again?
16:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i only see them being created in Create()
