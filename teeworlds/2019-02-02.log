11:20 <@Dune> ohi
11:21 < rand> oh hi mark
11:42 <@Dune> been working on porting teecomp
11:42 <@Dune> https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/blob/teecomp/src/game/teecomp_vars.h
11:42 <@Dune> not sure if any features would be welcome in teeworlds beyond the statboard
13:24 < Oy> hm, not sure which would be very useful
14:42 < day> what does the 'difficulty' mean in the server details section? is that something the admin can just set?
14:51 < bridge> [freenode] <richrd> What's teecomp?
15:29 < Oy> day: yeah, a server admin can set the supposed difficulty(sv_skill_level) for a server
17:06 < day> Oy: i see. i guess it could be useful to rank mods. i just noticed that various ctf servers have different difficulties
17:11 <@Dune> trying to figure something for https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1852 and related issues
17:11 <@Dune> would a few commands with a tip like https://i.imgur.com/tohAY2z.png be a solution?
17:12 <@Dune> then 1) you would also be able to mute players from the chat without pausing the game for a long time and going through the options
17:12 <@Dune> and 2) you would keep the tab -> autocomplete consistency (right now tab does something else in whisper)
17:13 <@Dune> maybe there is a more elegant solution
17:14 <@Dune> also, how should that be done? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1639 client-side?
18:19 < Oy> that should probably be server sided
18:20 < Oy> that tip seems like a good idea
18:25 <@Dune> so this touches the protocol?
18:26 < Oy> no
19:20 <@Dune> richrd: an old 0.5 client mod, that was nicely written and included in many other custom clients
19:20 <@Dune> lots of customisation (teamcolors, laser colors) and in-game statistics
19:20 < bridge> [freenode] <richrd> ah ok, thx for info!
19:21 < bridge> [freenode] <richrd> never tried any mods myself
20:53 <@Dune> oh it's february
20:53 <@Dune> rip the irc gitbot
21:03 <@Dune> heinrich5991, any way to use another service/webhook?
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> can't it "speak" through bridge?
21:41 < TeeSlayer> lol, I just got a mod application for my Multimap server in Polish
21:41 < TeeSlayer> I though it was spam at first
21:42 < TeeSlayer> s/though/thought
22:11 <@Dune> @LordSk I assume you mean the discord bot? yeah it could, but a better solution would be nice
22:12 <@Dune> the discord bot is way too verbose for irc
22:30 < Learath2> Dune: you can enable the irc hook in the repo if you are an admin
22:30 <@Dune> I think we were using a service
22:32 <@Dune> I'm not an admin anyway
22:32 <@Dune> services got discontinued on 2019-01-31
22:32 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: github just turned off the IRC service for good
22:33 <@heinrich5991> (along with the other integration stuff)
22:33 < Learath2> why would they even?
22:34 <@heinrich5991> they have a new system
22:43 < rand> M$t
22:45 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: most future-proof way would probably be to write our own bot that receives HTTPS hooks from github
22:45 < Learath2> I have that on ddnet, you can use it if you want
22:45 <@Dune> if it has similar output, that'd be nice imo
22:45 < Learath2> Oh that sends to discord though, so you might need to add in irc aswell
22:46 <@Dune> ah, we have a discord one already
22:46 <@Dune> but discord supports larger text/verbose than irc
22:47 <@Dune> so what is suitable for one isn't for the other
22:47 < Learath2> We used to use the discord one for ddnet but it didn't have any filters so it kept sending dozens of messages when bors was merging branches
22:47 <@Dune> heinrich5991 configured filters and it works well
22:48 < Learath2> heinrich5991: they have filters for the discord integration now?
22:48 <@heinrich5991> no
22:48 <@heinrich5991> not in the way ddnet needs it
