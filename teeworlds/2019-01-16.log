13:06 < Teeworlds> [documentation] Dune-jr pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fhWbn
13:06 < Teeworlds> documentation/master 8688ac2 Jordy Ruiz: Remove CommunityWeb stuff. Fixes #10
16:57 <@Dune> I reported some spam; will see if github does anything about it, otherwise gotta delete stuff manually. can't delete issues :/
17:00 < Oy> had spam messages by that user before
17:03 < Oy> could block the user
17:04 <@Dune> can you block the user as teeworlds?
17:04 < Oy> from the whole teeworlds organization yeah
17:05 <@Dune> well yeah just do that then
17:05 < Oy> ok. just for s some days?
17:05 < Oy> *-s
17:06 < Oy> there's a beta feature that allows deleting issue. could activate it
17:06 <@Dune> does it remove or hide his messages/issues on the board? sometimes those spamguys come back to edit their stuff with links
17:07 < Oy> don't think it hides his messages when i block him
17:08 < Oy> blocked him for 7 days
17:08 <@Dune> https://help.github.com/articles/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account/
17:09 <@Dune> In repositories you own, blocked users also cannot:Open issues or send pull requestsComment on issues, pull requests, or commits
17:09 <@Dune> seems like you're right
17:10 < Oy> enabled issue deleting. be careful :P
17:10 < Oy> and deleted the spam one
17:11 <@Dune> I think it's reserved to admins :)
17:11 <@Dune> so that's at least one thing I can't break
17:11 < Oy> seems u need admin permissions yeah :)
17:12 < Oy> but i think u have them on localization rep
17:12 <@Dune> whoops indeed
17:12 < Oy> teeworlds-translation i mean :)
17:13  * Dune hastily disables vim hotkeys on https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-translation/*
17:13 < Oy> u want them on documentaion too?
17:13 < Oy> :D
17:13 <@Dune> might as well
17:16 < Oy> ok. done
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> hi
17:27 < Oy> hey
17:36 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fhlZO
17:36 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master b45545e oy: added missing information for config commands and removed some outdated ones
17:36 < Oy> spam works again \o/
17:37 <@Dune> ho
17:37 <@Dune> @heinrich5991 :)
17:41 < Oy> hm, isn't there already a "no limit"-option for the screenshot/demos?
17:42 <@Dune> hm
17:42 < Oy> the scrollbars have an infinite param in the code
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> lol there is
17:42 <@Dune> yes
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> oopsie
17:42 < Oy> :P
17:42 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/b45545e6d382cdf953a3c313ba960b64b598c6db/src/engine/shared/config_variables.h#L25
17:43 < Oy> does the ui work?
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> whats the default value once you enable automatic records?
17:44 < Oy> 10
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> hm what about moving the infinite to the right as it is more intuitive?
17:45 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1515 is this a valid issue?
17:45 < Oy> yeah, we could change that for the ui
17:45 < Oy> that got fixed for 0.6
17:46 < Oy> not sure if it's possible in 0.7
17:46 < Oy> have to check the code
17:47 <@Dune> not sure if that can be done well @Sonix
17:47 <@Dune> it could be a bit awkward
17:47 <@Dune> if 1000 is just before infinite
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> to me it is normal to have the value increase going to the right
17:48 <@Dune> I agree
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> thats why I created the issue too lol, didnt know / forgot it was there
17:51 <@Dune> day: what do you get with sdl2-config --version
17:52 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1834 I assume those should be localized?
17:52 <@Dune> that would be a lot of localization work
17:55 < day> Dune: 2.0.9
17:55 <@Dune> what was the 2.0.9 SDL bug alrready? we should document it somewhere like in the FAQ
17:56 < Oy> short regular freezes, just effected windows
17:57 <@Dune> so https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1693 ?
17:57 <@Dune> should be tagged windows then
17:58 < day> arg. tried to be precise and then i mix up 0 and 1 >.<
17:58 < day> i added/edited the github issue
17:58 <@Dune> you can edit issue titles :)
17:59 < day> didnt see the title was also affected :>
18:20 < Oy> updated the tags
18:35 <@Dune> is there any plan to reuse the skin system HSL color picker? if so, it could be nice to split it in a different function: https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/commit/453bea8600d0dd6519da4fea68215942b82a0ea7
18:36 <@Dune> maybe in the editor? or is that too big, @LordSk ?
18:44 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/b45545e6d382cdf953a3c313ba960b64b598c6db/src/game/variables.h#L61
18:44 <@Dune> max value looks bugged
18:45 <@Dune> `MACRO_CONFIG_INT(PlayerColorMarking, player_color_marking, 0xFF0000FF, 0, 0`
18:47 < Oy> the editor has some picker as well
18:48 < Oy> both should probably use the same function someday
18:49 <@Dune> https://imgur.com/a/dTVVuEa
18:49 < Oy> think the marking was different than the other color parts
18:49 <@Dune> but that macro_config_int definitely has something wrong
18:50 <@Dune> it defaults to a value that is not in between min and max
18:50 < Oy> there's no min or max
18:50 < Oy> when min and max are zero u can use every value u want
18:51 < Oy> don't remember which color channels are adjustable for the marking
18:51 <@Dune> oh, whoops then :)
18:52 < Oy> :P
18:52 < Oy> you learn sth new every day :)
18:53 <@Dune> I bet day really regrets this username now
18:53 < Oy> haha :D
19:00 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/b45545e6d382cdf953a3c313ba960b64b598c6db/src/base/color.h#L115-L119
19:00 <@Dune> looks like HSL, not HSV
19:13 < Oy> yeah, seems odd
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I actually kinda need a color picker yeah
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> for the editor
19:16 <@Dune> see https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1980 @LordSk
19:40 <@Dune> huh, is https://www.freelists.org/list/teeworlds still a thing?
19:50 < Oy> no, was closed https://www.freelists.org/post/teeworlds/Closing-down-mailing-list
22:34 < day> is the max ping filter value ignored if there are no server below the limitation?
23:03 <@Dune> shouldn't be?
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Dune what's the matter? (you pinged me)
23:54 <@Dune> the IRC service is fixed
23:55 <@Dune> well if it's really a github service and not a webhook, it'll stop by the end of the month anyway
