14:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> How can i contribute to pullrequests of others?
14:33 < rand> with PR on their own branch
14:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> on the pr branch?
14:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> How do i do that? Fork their fork and then checkout the pr branch commit and then make a pr?
14:34 < rand> yep
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> uffa ima try
14:35 < rand> it's a solution I know
14:35 < rand> maybe there is a simpler one
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> there is this option of request changes on github.com on the pr directly but that one is a bit weird and tricky to test
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> you can fetch the branch to FETCH_HEAD
14:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> then create a branch based on that
14:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and then PR their repo on the correct branch
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> like that: `git fetch "git_url" branch`
15:02 < minus> website back up btw
15:03 < minus> vmware esxi + debian 9 + vmnet3 network driver = boom
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @LordSk that sounds way more confusing but probably more effective if you know how to use git
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah it's not much better tbh
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> "you can fetch the branch to FETCH_HEAD" you already lost me on the first step xd
16:46 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr opened pull request #1736: Make the ready state indicator a small green star instead of the whole line green (master...feature-smallreadystate) https://git.io/fpzjg
16:47 < minus> downloads.teeworlds.com TLS fixed and de-cloudflared
16:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> nice, thanks minus
17:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> minus: version.teeworlds.com still down though?
17:10 < minus> yeah, i didn't do anything there
17:31 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] LordSk opened pull request #1737: Broadcast visual upgrade (master...feature/broadcast2) https://git.io/fpgke
18:09 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpgqF
18:09 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master d86165b oy: changed ready character to a checkmark. #1736
18:32 < Dune> hey
18:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> hi
18:33 < Dune> Oy: so you want me to port the server DamageInd code to the client?
18:33 < Oy> hey
18:34 < Oy> Dune: yeah probaly best
18:34 < Dune> alright
18:34 < Dune> trying to do that without introducing any bugs
18:34 < Oy> :P
18:36 < Dune> this actually looks difficult because instead of sending a packet at once, two packets are sent - one for the health damage and one for the armor damage. So I do not know the total damage
18:37 < Dune> I should just have two m_HealthAmount and m_ArmorAmount entries I guess.
18:37 < Dune> it compresses the two packets in one :)
18:42 < Oy> hm, yeah might be better
18:43 < Oy> btw. what's the status of the macos app? can't find the folder?
18:58 < Dune>  [quakenet] <heinrich5991> not really. the created mac bundle doesn't work [quakenet] <heinrich5991> as in: doesn't find the data directory
18:58 < Dune> that is the last I heard of it
19:06 < Oy> ok thx
19:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i have also troubbles compiling on mac.... dunno why
19:18 < Oy> whats the problem?
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oy: something seemed to change and it causes a problem with the $CURRENTDIR var. In 0.6 the $CURRENTDIR var pointed to the ressources folder in the app. And currently it depends on the current working directory which normally never is the ressources folder. Maybe we have to change something in storage.cpp but older build systems seem to magically work.
19:24 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpgnk
19:24 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 499653c oy: consider max clients configuration for dbg_dummies. closes #1735
19:28 < Oy> ChillerDragon could replace the current src/engine/shared/storage.cpp with https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/69fe8ec1bc8900b517765d8cc4933e0b96df5104/src/engine/shared/storage.cpp and then try 
19:50 <@Dune> can't have a goddamn pr without a typo somewhere no matter how much i proofread
19:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @oy error sdl.h file not found.... but the file is located teeworlds/other/include
19:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> on windows there are the lib files in the root dir... sdl2.lib and sdl2main.lib do i need them for mac?
19:56 <@Dune> should be in other/sdl I think
19:56 <@Dune> not suyre
19:56 <@Dune> The description on https://www.teeworlds.com/ needs to be updated if the player limit is raised :D
19:57 < minus> shipping header files is a Bad Idea
19:57 <@Dune> Well, guess not, it's not raised for the standard gamemodes either way
19:57 < minus> not as much as shipping binaries of libraries
19:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @Dune is this different than on windows/linux?
19:57 <@Dune> other/sdl/include/SDL.h on my windows
19:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yep same on my mac
19:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> still the error
19:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> strange
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @heinrich5991 are you here?
21:10 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds-maps] Sonix- pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpgE3
21:10 < Teeworlds> teeworlds-maps/master 7fefdb4 Sonix-: Some fixes and improvements
21:21 < rand> I think m_PlayerLines should be reset on "OnReset()" for the scoreboard
21:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Why "Round" got changed to "Match" in the scoreboard?
21:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> "Match 1/1"
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Guys, did u try if the dynamic camera works properly?
21:56 <@Dune> I did a bunch of tests after the toggle dynamic cam tweak
21:56 <@Dune> is something wrong?
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> nvm i think its on my side
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> old binds i believe
21:59 <@Dune> that's quite possible
21:59 <@Dune> commands changed
23:14 <@Dune> rand: what kind of tab behavior do you want?
23:52 < rand> what sonix said, with a number on a corner for example
23:52 < rand> I could scale down the tee icon, that was the plan, but I forgot
