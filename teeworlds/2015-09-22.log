01:00 < peter1789> hello, I have known for the score. now why can we sometimes kill within the same team in ctf mode ?

17:21 < allu2> heinrich5991: I noticed your  proof of consept http masterserver and though in case you haven't read http://blog.ppy.sh/post/61639194302/stopping-a-ddos might be interesting, seems to have same theme in turning service protocol to HTTP to combat DDoS with services like Cloudflare
19:52 <@minus> allu2: doesn't really provide any new information
19:52 <@minus> it does provide a new idea though: cloudflare provides WebSocket support, so if you need bidi communication there's that
20:29 < allu2> Well thought it could be interesting to read anyhow ^^

23:03 < thegreat> how??
23:03 <@matricks> block server?
23:04 < thegreat> yes halloween
23:04 < Henningstone> thegreat: does your console say something like this? ERROR: the master server reports that clients can not connect to this server.
23:04 < thegreat> no
23:04 < thegreat> it says there is no such command
23:04 < Henningstone> I entered completely the same line!
23:04 < Henningstone> it MUST work
23:05 < thegreat> go on block server and tell em the lne again
23:08 < Henningstone> thegreat: enter exactly this line:
23:08 < Henningstone> ./teeworlds_srv "sv_register 1; sv_name blaa; sv_gametype ctf; sv_map ctf5"
23:08 < MertenNor> Henningstone: he probably just need to install freetype 2  witch should be already built in to 0.6.3 but idk.. 
23:08 < Henningstone> you are talking completely mess.
23:09 < MertenNor> ?
23:09 < MertenNor> why?
23:10 < Henningstone> because all that has nothing to do with what we are talking about :/
23:10 < MertenNor> oh yeah.. xD lol I was trying to get 0.6 to work for him.. 
23:11 < MertenNor> is he trying to host his own server?
23:11 < Henningstone> on 0.5 ._.
23:13 < MertenNor> Here you go: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=5219 
23:13 < MertenNor> looks like the MediaFire link still works and there is a video tutorial also..
23:13 < MertenNor> ;)
23:14 < MertenNor> and I am guessing you already have your ports opend right?
23:14 < Henningstone> he seems not to know what "ports" are if I'm right, though
23:14 < MertenNor> oh.. XD
23:15 < MertenNor> just find a youtube video for him.. but he would need to know the admin and the password for the router..
23:15 < MertenNor> ah well.. I am off Cya Guys another day
23:15 < MertenNor> Night!
23:15 < Henningstone> bb
