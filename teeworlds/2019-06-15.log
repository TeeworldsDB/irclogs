07:34 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> so when is teeworls v0.8 going to come out with a compatibility mode that supports all past server versions?
07:35 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> this whole fragmented version thing sucks
08:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> What you want isn't playing vanilla 0.6 with 0.7 or 0.8 clients. What you want is a better mod system, that loosely couples the mod code with the vanilla code to make upgrading mods to higher vanilla versions a breeze.
08:58 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Ideally an interface for a script language with multi mod support and on-runtime-drop-ins.
10:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> you would still have to modify the gamecore to fully support older mods and reintroduce old bugs.
12:43 < Dune> rachelfish: teeworlds has always worked like that. Major versions break compatibility. The only reason it's different this time is that 0.6 lasted so long there is a lot of old unmaintained content on 0.6
13:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ddrace reimplemented bugs from 0.5
13:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the wallhammer ‚ù§
13:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> imo still best feature even for vanilla
13:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> With multi mod support, you could provide a compatibility mod that exactly provides those features (bugs).
13:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Sounds interesting
13:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Build it!
14:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Sadly that would be years too late.
14:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> I actually believe there was a project trying to do this. Anyway, without the support of the vanilla dev stuff this would be no fun.
14:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> But yeah, something like Bukkit/Spigot for minecraft would have been awesome.
14:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Just imagine combining every mod with instagib etc. üôâ
14:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> A second mod would add LordSk's InstaShields.
14:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> And a third mod would replace the laser by grenade launchers.
14:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> A fourth mod would add Catch.
14:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> And finally, the fifth mod Domination.
14:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Oh and of course a mod that introduces smart bots.
16:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon i think we can't really add skin parts in the middle of 0.7
16:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> If people use it they won't be seen by everyone
16:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> That defeats the point of official skins
16:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm
16:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> imo its still early 0.7
16:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and it doesnt break too much
16:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> seing a default skin in a outdated version is fine imo
16:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nobody will play the version without high dpi support anyways hehe
20:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh btw @Dune you know what is really game breaking. Its removing weak hook we shouldnt do that before 0.8
20:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't know much about that. I didn't day skins are game breaking, just that, like mapres, official skin parts make sense at major releases. There is little point in making it official if you can't rely on everyone seeing it, right?
21:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> after a while you can rely on the majority seeing it. Also you can rely on not having to install the skin if you use the latest version on a new device etc.
23:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Hmm i added a new playerflag. But if i send it on any server that is not compiled with this playerflag i cant move.
23:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Any ideas what is casuign this?
23:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> what do you mean by playerflag?
