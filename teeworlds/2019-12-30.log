03:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does anyone use golang on a more advanced level?
03:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I'm not. what's your question? ðŸ˜‰
03:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> trying to parallelize my "strap-on" vpn detection for tw servers in order to have a go routine for every server the user asks to monitor., kinda getting errors I don't quite get the cause of I've been learning the language for  days, so I don't know much there.
03:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> "read tcp 192.168.178.25:55587->server_ip:port: use of closed network connection"
03:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> for 3 days*
03:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> os?
03:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> this here, https://github.com/jxsl13/TeeworldsEconVPNDetectionGo trying to add a sync.WaitingGroup in order for the main thread to block
03:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> currently macOS
03:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'd guess it might behave exactly the same on linux
04:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> also trying to start the monitoring function by simply prefixing it with go(BanCaller.go the function call in CallTELNET(...))
04:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (added a new branch with the latest parallel attempt): https://github.com/jxsl13/TeeworldsEconVPNDetectionGo/tree/wip_parallel
04:29 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> so what's the problem? just make the goroutines, but also make sure you manage the collections and disposals of them
06:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the problem was some socket stuff being in the main thread.
06:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> so shifting the go to the main function helped
06:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> into the main function*
08:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._. if someone wants to ban vpn users, have fun >:D https://github.com/jxsl13/TeeworldsEconVPNDetectionGo
09:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh cool so this can be slapped on a vanilla server huh?
14:33 < Dune_> https://i.imgur.com/kvgodhB.png
14:33 < Dune_> whoops
14:33 < Dune_> looks like code duplication :D
14:56 < Oy> kinda :)
15:00 < Dune_> should put weapon stats on by default at next release. they should be well rounded by then 
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yes, it can @ChillerDragon, any server with econ enabled
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I see Sublime Merge love there :o
18:13 < Dune_> oh, tried to do it just like https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/eaf57aa739a43ab38659f1023196fb1ccbe10bc6?diff=unified and I got a bug :D
18:14 < Dune_> wonder if it has it too
18:16 < Dune_> yeah
18:16 < Dune_> Oy: this breaks autocomplete for nicks :D
19:47 < Oy> Dune_: hm, works for me
19:47 < Dune_> huh really
19:47 < Oy> how is it broken?
19:48 < Dune_> if you press tab, nicks don't get autocompleted
19:48 < Dune_> it erases the parameter
19:48 < Oy> just tested, works for me
19:49 < Dune_> tried /whisper Du<Tab> or /rank O<tab> ?
19:49 < Dune_> both break for me 
19:50 < Oy> no just opened chat and used tab completion at the start of the msg
19:51 < Dune_> oh yeah, that works. But you need tab completion at least for /w
19:51 < Dune_> https://i.imgur.com/XjGqmhA.gif
19:51 < Oy> ah ok
22:19 < Fels> oink
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ðŸ˜® Fels
23:53 < Fels> what
