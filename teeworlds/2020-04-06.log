15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wasnt there shift+tab at some point to iterate in reverse order on nicknames in chat?
15:42 < Dune> @ChillerDragon that was always ctrl+tab
15:43 < Dune> iirc shift+tab triggers steam overlay
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> doesn't work with steam
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Dune was faster :p
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I didn't know this, nice
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> can you see all controls somewhere in the client or is a list anywhere without looking into the source?
16:09 < Dune> no
17:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> omg fok steam
17:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rip muzzle memory but thanks for the key bois
17:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what about adding a option to rebind it to shift for non steam users?
17:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @ChillerDragon rule #2: a lot of people don't speak uwu
17:24 < Dune> add options to everything!
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Assa sowwy
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Lmao
18:02 < bridge> [freenode] <richrd> :D
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> f1 options for most stuff would be nice, as creating custom UI for everything seems to be a pain.
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> remove ui and make tw console only. Also solves all mousesense issues.
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you asked for an option, and now ridiculing support, weird.
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I mean yea I really want shift+tab but i also see issues with overconfiguring vanilla
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i mean people like @Ryozuki always overdo things especially regarding sounds :p
20:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I also opened a pr regarding sound, as chat is annoying, even tho one does kinda get used to it.
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> making chat only visible via f1 would be nice as well.
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hiding chat would be actually nice
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can already do that in f1 iirc
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not turning it off and loosing messages just hide the render
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> or even with the GUI?
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I don't wanna get annyed while playing, but when caught >:0
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there are infinite possibilites of options you'd want to set
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i want to quickly take screesnhots and hide all chat also server messages and then read what people write
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you would need 20 commands and 2 pages of options to satisfy everyone just with chat
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no, just the requested ones
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not just remove current behaviour
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and replace it with correct chat hide
20:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I would not want evrything to be done with gui, as that's not worth the effort, but if people ask whether some option is actually configurable, I'd share the f1 command
20:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if there is one
20:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye f1 commands are easy to share navigting the gui can get confusing imo
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> make the configuration a bit mask (hue)
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> üòÑ
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> some people found that not 2k20 enough, so yeah, 20 commands will have to do
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> all games I know, if any options there are for chat, are usually two or three checkboxes. This ought to be enough
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> just send f1 commands üòÆ
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Since we're already way past this, I think we shouldn't add more...
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no gui, more f1
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Still, I mean, what's next, people want their button purple, and we make a f1 option for that?
20:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think people would not request options that benefit nobody.
20:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think there were like some requests for chat sounds and chat gui/ingame gui in general
20:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's currently about everything that's requested to be configurable
20:45 < wavi> any idea why every now and then after restarting my TW server I'm unable to connect to econ?
20:45 < wavi> neither with nodejs or telnet. server configuration hasn't been changed.
20:49 < wavi> I cant even connect with telnet from a shell that's on the same server
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yes, the socket is not being properly returned to the OS, so you need to wait for a while before restarting the server.
20:57 < wavi> the TW server host os?
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the tw server binds some port by aquiring a socket. when the server is shut down, it does not seem to properly return the socket, so the OS does take a while to clean this up properly.
20:58 < wavi> ok, gotcha
20:59 < wavi> should it resolve itself in some time?
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> this is incorrect
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the OS can reclaim the sockets whenever it wants
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the TCP standard says that it should not be opened until some timeout expires
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> *opened again
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you can opt out of that by talking to the OS
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> so the tcp timeout is the reason, then.
21:01 < wavi> ah so... if the socket is left hangingk after I've killed the TW server, will the server not be able to bind to that socket when I restart the server?
21:02 < wavi> that might explain why I can't seem to reconnect however long I wait
21:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the timeout needs to expire, then the socket can be bound again, my experience.
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yup
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> do you know what linux requires in order to bypass that behavoir?
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> some command that removes that behavior?
21:04 < wavi> ok, so right now I'd need to restart my teeworlds_srv to get it to bind to my econ port?
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yes
21:04 < wavi> cheers! thanks again for the help. really appreciate it ‚ù§Ô∏è
21:05 < wavi> maybe I'll restart my server later, got a bunch of people playing on it right now :D
