01:40 < bashNinja> does anyone know how teeworlds searches the LAN for available servers? I'm troubleshooting a problem and that information would be super helpful. 
02:27 <@Dune> bashNinja: scans 8300-8310 or 8303-8310 iirc
02:27 <@Dune> it's a setting
02:28 <@Dune> I think trunk teeworlds has some better message when it finds no server, that explains it scanned this limited range
02:28 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/f743aa1efd7f6c6b411a0639fa954d3cbd482de5/src/engine/serverbrowser.h#L135-L136
02:32 < bashNinja> Sweet. I'm looking in the right place.
02:33 < bashNinja> I've been digging into this: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/client/serverbrowser.cpp#L274-L332
02:39 < bashNinja> Hmm... It seems it's scanning ipv6 and I haven't solved exactly why.
02:40 < bashNinja> *scanning only
03:46 < bashNinja> I see what you mean by trunk teeworlds, finally. you mean built from source.
04:34 < bashNinja> OK. yes. Trunk has a message that says the servers need to have a port 8303 to 8310. My LAN server is on this range. 
08:57 < bashNinja> Solved it. It looks like it's not sending the broadcast packet to all the interfaces
08:57 < bashNinja> Thanks a ton Windows.
08:57 < bashNinja> Setting the interface I want to 'metric' 1 fixes it.
08:58 < bashNinja> also bindaddr breaks the server for some reason.
09:03 < ChillerDragon> I used bindaddr just fine what did you provide as argument?
09:04 < ChillerDragon> or does it only break lan broadcasts if you bind?
09:07 < bashNinja> it only seems to be breaking the LAN broadcast. I'm able to direct connect just fine.
09:07 < bashNinja> I get this error in the console too
09:07 < bashNinja> [2021-01-20 08:05:15][net]: failed to bind socket with domain 10 and type 2 (99 'Cannot assign requested address')
09:10 < bashNinja> I'm still trying to work out exactly what's happening.
09:24 < bashNinja> Yeah. I tested it on a full VM with ipv6 disabled. still has the issue.
09:24 < bashNinja> (though when ipv6 is disabled it gives another error)
09:24 < bashNinja> [2021-01-20 08:05:15][net]: failed to bind socket with domain 10 and type 2 (99 'Cannot assign requested address')
09:31 < ChillerDragon> oh thats what this message is about :D i always ignored it because all seemed fine
09:40 < bashNinja> I tried to detail it as much as I could here: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2843
