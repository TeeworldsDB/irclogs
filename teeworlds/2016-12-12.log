08:01 < Skippero0> hi
08:02 < Skippero0> i see my server is online but how come i cant access it at 192.168.0.17:8303 in my browser
08:20 < Skippero0> is anyone here 
08:26 < EastByte> Skippero0: what do you mean by it is 'online'? Just running?
08:27 < Skippero0> yes i see them connecting 
08:27 < Skippero0> on my terminal 
08:28 < EastByte> it's probably a NAT issue, you need to use your local ip to connect to your own server, while other players can use the browserlist
08:28 < Skippero0> but when i put 197.168.0.17:8303 i get this This site can’t be reached  192.168.0.17 refused to connect.
08:29 < Skippero0> my server is in the dmz 
08:30 < EastByte> so, it's not running on your own computer?
08:30 < Skippero0> its on my server computer running ubuntu12.04lts
08:32 < EastByte> ehm, what do you mean by "This site can’t be reached"
08:33 < EastByte> you should enter the address in the hostfield of the teeworlds client
08:33 < Skippero0> i used http://www.tecmint.com/install-teeworlds-game-in-linux/  to setup my server but  i guess i dont understand the the putting ip in the browser to access the game 
08:35 < Skippero0> i dont understand the part where it says The Teeworlds server will be started on the same IP of your server and the 8303 port by default, let’s say that your IP address is xxx.xxx.x.xxx, the server will be on at xxx.xxx.x.xxx:8303 by default.
08:36 <@heinrich5991> Skippero0: open the teeworlds client and select the LAN tab
08:36 <@heinrich5991> you'll see your server there
08:37 < Skippero0> ok sry im new to this
08:37 < EastByte> maybe not if the dmz has a different subnet
08:37 <@heinrich5991> ah right
08:43 < Skippero0> so your saying open it in my browser
08:44 < EastByte> look into your lan tab, if the server doesn't appear there you need to connect manually by typing the address into the host field
08:44 < EastByte> if this doesn't work there is a firewall issue
08:48 <@heinrich5991> Skippero0: we're not talking about a browser like firefox, chrome, internet explorer, safari, etc.
08:48 <@heinrich5991> you should start teeworlds or teeworlds.exe
08:48 < EastByte> well there is a screenshot in the tutorial: http://www.tecmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/TeeWorlds-02.jpg
08:49 < Skippero0> thanks
09:02 < Skippero0> so i cant acces the game from any other places other than my server 
09:11 < EastByte> Skippero0: sure you can but I don't understand what the problem is in your case
09:12 < Skippero0> i see i downloaded the game and connected to my server 
09:12 < Skippero0> its always losing connection 
09:12 < EastByte> while connecting?
09:12 < Skippero0> yes
09:13 < Skippero0> slow
09:13 < EastByte> and you are sure that 192.168.0.17 is the ip of your ubuntu server?
09:14 < Skippero0> yes 
09:14 < Skippero0> i put my external ip in the game and it loads 
09:14 < Skippero0> but slow
09:14 < EastByte> interesting
