00:03 < lvgx> @Assa how would we this ParTee API?
00:04 < lvgx> C++ based?
00:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> C++ Polymorphism: Basically an interface you derive from
00:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> It's still WIP, I have to add hooks for a lot of things
00:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> like "OnPlayerHook(HookerID, HookedID)", "OnJump()", Entity stuff, Damage stuff,
00:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> The list of minigames i want to have is long with teambased games, races and 1-Winner-Games
00:06 < lvgx> interresting
00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I have too much homeoffice time rn
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> virtual functions for every humand interaction?
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> human*
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> no, more
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> gamemodes should be able to spawn entities
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you may want to change consequences of human actions, too
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> for example TakeDamage
00:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> OnChat() will be interesting
00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> `Simon` says is on my list ðŸ˜ˆ
00:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> + have special gamelayers?
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that sounds rip
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> why does that sound rip?
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is my gut feeling
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the project or simon says? ðŸ˜„
00:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the project AND Simon says
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> :C
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> rather the project.
01:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @Chiller goodbye backwards compatible logs.
01:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> have fun.
10:50 < ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 but nothing changed agian right? Btw crazy issue purge you went through
10:50 < ChillerDragon> roat to 0 issues
10:50 < ChillerDragon> road* lmao
12:02 < ChillerDragon> did something with the settings/binds changed or am i just stoopid?
12:04 < ChillerDragon> I just updated my client to get the last 10 commits from master and i keep loading default binds :/
12:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Huuh
12:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> In 074 or so
12:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Not since afaik
12:13 < ChillerDragon> well i found this in the last 10 commits https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2604 but i dont htink it broke something maybe its my custom client idk
12:16 < ChillerDragon> Okay now i can not get my binds loading on vanilla master anymore :/ can anyone please give it a try and check if i lost my last brain cells or something broke
12:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> will do that later in the afternoon
13:25 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1588677922.png
13:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ahhh, that space was intended
13:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 go on writing :D I often see you writing and then you just stop
13:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you already said everything
13:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the space for `bind` should have stayed
13:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> time to revert a commit
13:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> thanks Chiller
13:41 < ChillerDragon> thanks for looking at it :)
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> no one but you did :D
16:50 < day> Dune: :3
17:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> Hey, is it possible to turn off force vote in the vote menu?
17:19 <@Dune> force vote?
17:19 <@Dune> for admins?
17:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> Yea the force vote button
17:20 <@Dune> that's for admins right?
17:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> I have a Gores Trainingsserver
17:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> And there has everyone access to f2
17:20 <@Dune> sounds bad
17:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> But they should not have the right to use force vote
17:20 <@Dune> well, people should be mods, not admins there
17:20 <@Dune> ah
17:20 <@Dune> then it's fine?
17:20 <@Dune> they can't force vote
17:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> I'm giving them access to mod to use some commands
17:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> But they can just use force vote to ban people for 5 minutes
17:21 <@Dune> I forgot what's the command to force a vote
17:21 <@Dune> `vote` ?
17:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> vote yes/no
17:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> I tryed also to disable that
17:22 <@Dune> does it work for them to use the F2 console?
17:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> But they can still use it
17:22 <@Dune> to `vote no` / `vote yes` ?
17:22 <@Dune> or only the GUI works?
17:22 <@Dune> (that'd be weird)
17:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> I disabled it for f2 but they can use it in the vote menu
17:22 <@Dune> hmm, strange, hold on
17:26 <@Dune> yeah https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L861
17:26 <@Dune> only checks for Authed(2
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> So I think it would be make more sense to disable that too ?
17:27 <@Dune> well it's a bug that mods can always force votes
20:17 < ChillerDragon> Oy binds broke btw
20:18 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1588677922.png 
20:21 < ChillerDragon> binding in console works also the exec command but loading binds from file on startup fails for me so i have to manually load my binds currently :/
20:26 <@Dune> gotta revert the last commit
20:26 <@Dune> > As libjsonparser-dev is now available, please consider linking against
20:26 <@Dune> system library instead of bundled ini.c.
20:27 <@Dune> is there something we can do about that?
20:27 <@Dune> or is that a package manager thing
20:38 < wavi> I just downloaded the latest teeworlds release from github, and I'm trying to start the server but it just throws "no such file or directory" ðŸ¤”
20:40 < wavi> https://lounge.bittemple.org/uploads/bf8427fad077cba4/image.png 
20:40 < wavi> any ideas?
20:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Dune: we can do something about that
20:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we need to detect if libjsonparser exists at build time and link to it if it is there
20:48 < Oy> oh
20:49 < wavi> oops, i didn't download the correct 64bit release ðŸ¤¦
