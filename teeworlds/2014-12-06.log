17:36 < TeaTowel> One question.
17:36 < TeaTowel> U know 0.6.3 update? If the server updated to this version and I still have 0.6.2
17:36 < TeaTowel> Could I still play on the updated server?
17:37 <@minus> yes
17:37 <@minus> 0.6.x is compatible
17:38 <@minus> the update is meant for the server mainly
17:39 < TeaTowel> Oh OK thanks!
17:45 <@matricks> minus: my bathroom is done \o/

17:48 <@matricks> all the dust in the corner etc is there because it used to be a washing machine there :)
17:48 <@minus> did you do all the yourself?
17:49 <@matricks> I did nothing :) I payed someone to take care of it :)
17:49 <@matricks> I'm doing some other stuff around the house however
17:49 <@minus> haha, fair enough
17:49 <@matricks> bathrooms are a bitch if you do something wrong
17:49 <@matricks> water damage is no laughing matter

17:50 <@minus> without the ugly bathtub. nice shower
17:50 <@matricks> yah
17:51 <@matricks> floor heating, dimmable spots in the roof, everything tiled etc
17:51 <@matricks> and I'm improving my appartment all over the place now, fixing up some damages that have been accumulated over the years
17:52 <@matricks> sanded down the benches in the kitchen and reoiled them
17:52 <@matricks> etc etc
