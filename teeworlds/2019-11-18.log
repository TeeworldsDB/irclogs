14:02 < day> Dune: was that bridge collapse in toulouse anywhere near you?
15:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> day: it's some 30km away in the countryside, and I'm in London
16:22 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> you know when a player picks up the enemy flag, the team gets 1 point?
16:22 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> can that be disabled?
16:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> richrd: not with a command, you have to change the sourcecode and change it yourself
16:25 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> right, I was hoping for some config option
16:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> and you have to change the modname, because you can technically get banned for naming a modded game like a vanilla one
16:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> richrd: i can program this into my ctf+ mod
16:26 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> do you think such an option might be accepted in the core game?
16:27 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> i'd like to have that option but it's i'm not so desperate to start building the game from source myself :/
16:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> hmm, no, simply because the next person asks why we can't make caps just score 10, the next wants +10 for every kill
16:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> list goes on
16:28 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> right, yeah
16:28 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> I know what you mean
16:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> sorry for my denglish
16:29 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> no don't worry, your english is fine!
17:17 < Dune> richrd: I think the CTF gametype is supposed to ensure one unique gameplay
17:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> Dune english > my english
17:49 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> Dune, what about other options such as teamdamage?
17:50 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> also the score and time limits can be tweaked
17:51 < richrd> test
18:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> sv_teamdamage 1
18:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> sv_timelimit 123
18:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> sv_scorelimit 42
18:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/blob/master/server_settings.md
18:16 < bridge_> [freenode] <richrd> Yes I know those options, my point was that CTF isn't unique because all those can be changed. It would be nice to be able also change something like sv_flagpickupscore
18:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> can sb explain what inp_grab does?
18:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> sounds a lot like raw input
19:28 < Dune> richrd: you are correct, yes, teamdamage breaks that rule
19:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> Dune, you could make teamdamage a tuning parameter... well thinking about it, it would break a lot more
19:43 < Dune> It might make sense. Team hooking is a tuning parameter 
22:23 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Assa yea I highly assume itâ€™s the raw mouse input. It says something about warping in the Code but idk what that means tho
