00:19 < Commie> does sox make wavepack?
03:11 < Commie> i just watch the aaron swartz doc ( in kow this is mildly off-topic, but, this is the internet, rite? aaron swartz is ot for internetz)
03:11 < Commie> is really sad
03:11 < Commie> if you r not a 1337 hax0r, you need to watch the doc to understand
05:18 < Inedible> dont you need to pay for it?
21:30 < ghost91> minus: why did you revert the compiling everything page..?
21:39 < Safa_[A_boy]> Hello. I'm using ArchLinux with KDE. There are some problems in the screen. The game is slow. I'm sure that V-Sync is the problem. What are the best settings for the game and for KDE?
21:39 < Safa_[A_boy]> Thanks :)
21:57 < ghost91> a friend of mine is also using arch + kde
21:58 < EastByte> I think that's uncommon
21:59 < ghost91> he is using borderless window: x, resolution: 1920x1200x24bit, V-Sync: x, FSAA samples: 0, no threaded rendering, quality textures: x, no texture compression compression, high detail: x
21:59 < ghost91> he does not have a dedicated graphics card
21:59 < ghost91> just an i5
22:00 < ghost91> Safa_[A_boy]: 
22:02 < Safa_[A_boy]> Thank you
22:02 < Safa_[A_boy]> I'll see it later :)
22:32 < ghost91> minus: I think you might have replaced the compiling everything page with the old one because of the github docu stuff
22:32 < ghost91> here is the link with the new stuff I wrote:

22:32 < ghost91> good night
22:55 < heinrich5991> Safa_[A_boy]: why are you sure that 'VSync is the problem'? do you know what vsync does?
23:45 < Safa_[A_boy]> heinrich5991: Not really. But it happens when I change VSync settings in the Kde system settings
23:45 < Safa_[A_boy]> Now it is "None" and it is really good
23:46 < heinrich5991> mh
23:47 < heinrich5991> maybe the vsync settings compete in some way
