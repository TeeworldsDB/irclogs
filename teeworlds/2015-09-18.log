00:42 <@minus> well, notreally surprising
00:42 < heinrich5991> why's that?
00:43 <@minus> html5 video is heavy-duty work
01:28 < peter1789> hello everyone
01:28 < peter1789> someone can tell me how to read the score in the bottom right corner in ctf ?
01:38 < peter1789> euh sorry I'm tired, I save the question and will ask again tomorrow
06:17 < allu2> day__: I got the same problem on Windows as well, oddly enough doesn't seem to affect other games I play as badly
08:01 < day__> minus: im using an i7 4790k and a gtx970. And it was just a music clip (still background). Although i am not sure if that changes the effort. Also, teeworlds is not experiencing any frame drops. It is more an 'out of sync' problem.
08:02 < day__> allu2: interesting. good to know that its reproducable on other pcs as well
08:06 < allu2> day__: kind of jittering for me, enough to make me look at the FPS yet noticing no drop in it
08:07 < day__> allu2: it appears once you start moving fast enough into x or y. the terrain corners start to chop (if you use the fixed cam)
16:55 < Stitch626> I havent some frame drops/lags/something else while playing an html5 video on youtube. And i have old hardware and i'm on windows.. but i disabled vsync, maybe thats change something?
18:14 < guenstig_werben> hi
18:15 < guenstig_werben> there is dm server running with a server side bot on it
18:15 < guenstig_werben> 195.154.80.148:8303
18:15 < guenstig_werben> I think it should get banned
18:17 < alket> hi all, how do I translate teeworlds
18:20 < alket> beside transifex
18:28 < heinrich5991> alket: 0.6 is unfortunately not translated through transifex
18:28 < heinrich5991> it's done in the json format
18:28 < alket> thats great then, i don't like transifex
18:29 < heinrich5991> if you just want to work around transifex, you can download the translations, update them and upload them again
18:29 < alket> no, its better json
18:29 < heinrich5991> but for 0.6 you either have to convert the transifex stuff or start from the 0.6 version of translation
18:29 < alket> but don't know where to find it
18:30 < heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-translation 
18:30 < heinrich5991> but check the forum link to see if someone already finished your language
18:31 < alket> it looks like no
18:31 < alket> its Albanian language
18:31 < alket> so forum search outputed nothing
18:32 < alket> heinrich5991: there is no english.json
18:32 < heinrich5991> just take some different language, for example german
18:32 < heinrich5991> the english strings are in every language file
18:32 < alket> ah, now i see it, thanks heinrich5991
18:55 <@minus> no need to bother with 0.6 translations anymore anyway, 0.7 will be released on december 24
18:59 < alket> minus: but many things will be the same no ?
18:59 <@minus> yes
19:06 < heinrich5991> minus: we have a release date nowadays?
19:06 <@minus> we have now.
