13:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is there only 1 server online in 0.7.2 or do i have some problems?
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah nvm had some filters on ^^ 0.7 menu still confuses me
14:11 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds-translation] Dune-jr pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fhGqq
14:11 < Teeworlds> teeworlds-translation/master e3a5045 Jordy Ruiz: Fix breton, dutch, estonian, lithuanian, turkish, ukrainian
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh btw is this a feature that navigating in the map editor is super weird in 0.7?
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what do you mean in particular? ^^
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> did u try it?
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the navigation became shomehow relative
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i mean the strg dragging navgiation
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it makes me really dizzy because i am so used to the static 0.6 map editor navigation
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> in 0.6 the layer was dragged exactly the way the mouse moves and in 0.7 it is moving in a different speed or something like that
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and i cant see the advantage of the new version it is less control imo
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> try with inp_grab 0/1?
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Can confirm that. With inp_grab 1 way worse.
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> (Although I am not sure if it was any different in 0.6)

20:18 <@Dune> hey Oy
20:18 <@Dune> who should be part of the flathub org?
20:18 <@Dune> you? minus too?
20:25 < Oy> hey
20:25 < Oy> dunno who wants :)
20:27 < Oy> yeah probably good to have 1 or 2 fail safe persons, when someone isn't available
20:34 <@Dune> yeah
20:38 <@Dune> any clue how to troubleshoot https://steamcommunity.com/app/380840/discussions/0/1743355067134127472/?tscn=1546889463 btw? I tried to ask them to run in cmd but it's a bit too difficult
20:43 <@heinrich5991> Dune: you could make a link and then pass the arg by going into the properties of that link
20:43 <@heinrich5991> you could add me to the org if you want
20:45 <@heinrich5991> Dune: you can even pass command line options via steam btw
20:45 <@heinrich5991> eh
20:46 <@heinrich5991> the problem is that the console closes, probably?
20:46 <@heinrich5991> then maybe pass "logfile teeworlds.log" (not sure if you can pass args containing spaces via steam)
20:52 <@heinrich5991> yes, it seems it supports spaces via quotes
20:54 <@heinrich5991> right-click on Teeworlds in Steam, Properties, Set Launch Options, enter "logfile teeworlds.log" (with quotes), start Teeworlds
20:54 <@heinrich5991> Dune: ^
20:54 <@Dune> command line would get closed yeah
20:54 <@heinrich5991> (logfile will contain all the stuff)
20:56 <@Dune> feel free to answer directly there if you have the time ^^
21:16 < Oy> instead of deleting the settings.cfg you can also start teeworlds with --default
21:20 < Oy> maybe a win7 thing - anyone has a win7 to test if it starts?
21:24 <@Dune> I do
21:25 < Oy> good :)
21:27 <@Dune> launches just fine for me from steam win7
21:28 < Oy> ok
21:29 < Oy> already checked the graphic card, that one should be fine too
21:34 < Oy> Dune: the log is probably in the folder where the executable is
21:46 < Oy> tested, will be in <path of steam installation>/SteamApps/common/Teeworlds/
21:47 < minus> Dune: nah, i pass
21:47 <@Dune> okie
21:47 < Oy> if someone doesn't know the steam install dir. open settings in steam, then go to "Downloads" tab and then click on "STEAM LIBRARY FOLDERS"
21:54 <@Dune> thanks
21:56 <@Dune> I'm getting a complaint, any way to settle https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1635 ?
21:58 < Oy> yeah, will do it for 0.7.3
21:59 < Oy> not sure if it should be an option in general
21:59 <@Dune> should be a server option right?
21:59 < Oy> in survival that start timer is pretty necessary
21:59 < Oy> yeah
22:15 < minus> warmup time should be configurable imo
22:15 <@Dune> there is sv_warmup but it doesn't cover everything
