00:19 < Ryozuki> is there suposed to be a info.png under datasrc/ui/icons ?
00:19 < Ryozuki> cmake complains it is missing
00:19 < Ryozuki> uh, i guess it has relation to https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/d87c2cb6870edb52621c4f11d4b364bc83fd8287
00:21 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Ryozuki opened pull request #1996: Remove the no longer used info.png from cmake (master...patch-1) https://git.io/fhrQm
00:22 < Ryozuki> maybe it should be written down to make sure the cmake file listings match when making a pr that changes assets or smth
00:28 <@Dune> it's not great that cmake has to be updated individually everytime 
00:29 <@Dune> Adding cmake to the CI could be a plus
00:40 < Ryozuki> yeah i agree
00:40 < Ryozuki> some automatic solution would be better
