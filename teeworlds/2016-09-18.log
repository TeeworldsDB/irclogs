13:56 < jxsl13> teeworlds.com down?
13:56 < jxsl13> oh, not anymore
14:10 < EastByte> high packet-loss on tw.com
14:11 < EastByte> minus: it's time to put tw.com behind cloudflare :p
14:50 < Kottizen> ddos :(
15:35 <@minus> it's weekend \o/
15:37 < Kottizen> I would prefer if Cloudflare or something with equivalent functionality was set-up in front of teeworlds.com. I'm not sure if I can continue hosting the website if it's the target of additional attacks...
16:32 < Dunedune> I'm having timeouts on teeworlds.com
16:32 < Dunedune> am I the only one?
16:34 < Kottizen> Dunedune: It was ddosed. :/
16:35 < Dunedune> arr.
16:35 < Dunedune> -_-
16:35 < Dunedune> well thanks for the info
18:21 <@minus> website is back
18:21 <@minus> moved it somewhere safe
18:21 < EastByte> I see cloudflare
18:22 < EastByte> so, can cloudflare be considered for the masterservers?
19:39 < nameless_tee71> I WISH Teeworlds TO BE ON PS4, XBOX ONE, XBOX 360 & PS3
19:40 < EastByte> a wild cider appeared
20:19 < Stitch626> let it die
21:12 < minus_> yeah, i kinda expected that to happen
21:13 < minus_> no, i didn't move teeworlds.com to my server, i'm not stupid
21:15 < EastByte> minus_: pls auth
21:15 < minus_> ;)
21:19 <@minus> oh, i'm still here
21:19 < EastByte> what the hell did you do?
21:20 <@minus> DDoS on my server is what happened; or at least the DDoS-filter turned on
21:21 < EastByte> proplay has voxility now, so it should be fine
21:21 < Rafael> XD
21:22 <@minus> yeah, UDP is blocked tho, so my VPN is dead
21:22 < EastByte> ah, that figures
21:27 < EastByte> minus: How does ssl work with cf? Do you need to pass your private key?
21:27 <@minus> no
21:27 <@minus> look at the cert
21:28 < EastByte> Begins On 09/06/2016
21:28 <@minus> look at SANs and issuer
21:29 < EastByte> so it was issued by cloudflare
21:29 <@minus> yup
21:29 < EastByte> free?
21:29 <@minus> yup
21:29 < EastByte> okay
21:29 <@minus> it was literally one click to enable
21:29 <@minus> it's the easiest part ._.
21:30 < EastByte> and what's about browser validation?
21:30 <@minus> what about it?
21:31 < EastByte> as I visited tw.com there was no verification gateway
21:31 < EastByte> which I usually see on cf protected sites
21:31 <@minus> you see that on only the fewest of websites using CF
21:31 <@minus> if the threat level is "under attack"
21:32 < EastByte> ah
21:32 < EastByte> hm, lets see what happens if I wget the teeworlds logo from multiple servers at the same time
21:32 <@minus> probably nothing
21:33 <@minus> the setting is on "Essentially off"
21:34 < EastByte> well, worked, now I have 9 replicas of twlogo.png
21:34 <@minus> gg
21:35 < EastByte> I just hope that will permanently work for the tw masters
21:39 <@minus> well, there's always the solution that matricks discovered 6 years ago
21:51 <@matricks> who to the what now?
21:51 < rand> not using masters .
21:51 < rand> ?
21:51 <@minus> no, just shutting the whole thing down
21:52 <@matricks> :)
21:53 < Stitch626> :D
21:54 <@matricks> multiplayers would be fun if it wasn't for all the other people
22:01 < EastByte> I'll quote that at some point :)
22:28 <@minus> pls stop ddosing my box it's hard to irc like that
22:37 < Dunedune> 6 years? stop making us feel old, minus
