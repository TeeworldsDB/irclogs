02:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> why does it have to be within a font?
02:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that prevents people from switching fonts as they like
02:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what's the downside of icons like we've done until 0.7?
02:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think I'm the one who introduced UTF-8 code in Teeworlds to display an icon and that was because I didn't find someone to draw one
03:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i thought using icon font is the point of not breaking font changing
03:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> we already have multi fonts. and drawing an icon can be done by adding a unicode char in front of the string.
03:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> plus it will share the already allocated font atlas without needing a new texture handle and vram.
03:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i mean if it is next to a string i don't see the down side.
03:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> plus it is a great chance to move the X and the cog icon to the private use area page of unicode to further prevent icon breaking for ppl changing fonts.
10:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I support icon fonts
13:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Is it common for games/software to compile a custom font to display icons?
13:58 < ChillerDragon> its a web thing for sure 
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i think it is pretty common for icons that need to layout like text. controller buttons, objective icons and such. and we are adding icons besides the text.
