13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's the post that took me the longest to determine if spam or not so far
13:49 < minus> that's the same dude that recently sent us an email
13:50 < minus> the domain in his profile is actually parked, lol
13:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> lol
13:51 < minus> can't peek into his linkedin profile without an account :(
13:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> can't peek into his profile without notifying him that I did
13:53 < minus> i'm considering writing a proxy (like nitter, etc) that just uses a throwaway account
13:55 < minus> anyway, i'd just not approve his post
13:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> linkedin is very aggressive about keeping their data from scrapers
13:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> eh, the pre-moderation is just a human check
13:56 < minus> linkedin ranks about the same as 4chan in my book
13:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> by which criterion?
13:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> by the way, you can get banned just for looking at a large number of profiles on linkedin, so you can definitely not use the proxy for any unusual behaviour
13:57 < minus> it's the sewers of the business world
13:57 < minus> i think i may just have insulted 4chan a bit too much
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> much like facebook, I find it useful as a directory
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if you need to contact someone you know the name of / someone from a specific company
13:59 < minus> it'd be fine if it wasn't for recruiters, i guess
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but yes, even with being conservative when connecting with people, my feed quickly turned into diarrhea, just because prolific people on that website aren't the best
13:59 < minus> that said, i've never had an account there
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> oh shit I had to do something before 2pm
14:57 < ChillerDragon> lmao @Dune this is a troll post right?
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> I'm sorry Chiller, but I think it's serious considering the emails they've gotten :D
15:07 < ChillerDragon> wow :D
17:26 < minus> well, "serious"
17:27 < minus> it's literally a "i have an idea i just need someone to code it"
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well, it is implied that it is a paid job, but I would expect the pay to be worthless internet money
17:37 < minus> most likely
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> Id take shares from this kick ass entrepreneur's company as pay
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> i mean crypto + teeworlds is probably as close as you can get to a infinite money glitch
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> wat is this
