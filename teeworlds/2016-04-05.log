22:46 < Henningstone> Hm, I've got a question about the serverbrowser code (engine part)... It might sound stupid, but is there a specific reason why that stuff is so complicated? Why not store all the server entries in an array object and that's it?
22:49 <@minus> are they not?
22:51 < Henningstone> As far as I can see the CServerEntry objects are stored in a CHeap object and pointers to every single one are being stored in a dynamically allocated c array (CServerEntry**)
22:52 < NoxNebula> minus: it's certainly a pointer list
22:52 < Henningstone> furthermore, the length of the dynamic array and the number of CServerEntrys is stored in integer variables
22:53 < Henningstone> *dynamically allocated array
23:11 < Henningstone> I'm especially astonished by "CHeap m_ServerlistHeap;" and "CServerEntry **m_ppServerlist;", which could be imo replaced by a single "array<CServerEntry> m_ServerList" to simplify things much more 
23:15 <@minus> i think the pointers are there so it can be sorted
