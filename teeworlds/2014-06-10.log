11:12 < Madara> Hey Gays.
11:13 < Madara> *guys.
11:24 <@minus> o/
15:55 < Madara> I'm too dumb for C++
16:18 < Madara> Can someone help me out.
16:18 < Madara> I don't understand the concept of pointers and so on
16:18 < Madara> Why doesn't CChat::Say(0, "lol"); work?
16:19 < Madara> CChat::Say(int Team, const char *pLine)
16:30 < EastByte> that's oop
16:31 < EastByte> (object oriented programming)
16:31 < EastByte> you can't call non static methods without object
16:44 < Madara> ok
16:45 < Madara> I don't want to abuse you, but is there a good tutorial on that?
16:45 < EastByte> there are tons of tutorials
16:46 < EastByte> just search for something like "C++ for beginners" :>
16:49 < Madara> hm okay
16:49 < fisted> Madara: if you think you have found a good tutorial, be sure to check with someone good at C++ for whether it's okay
16:49 < Madara> I mean I understand all that logic stuff, but who don't knows that.
16:50 < fisted> most tutorials on C and C++ are not
16:50 < Madara> ok
16:50 < Madara> bye
16:50 < fisted> (generally these languages are better learned w/ a book than by tutorial)
16:50 < fisted> bye
16:51 < Madara> fisted, books are cool, but not always :D
16:51 < Madara> Actually I have a book, but it doesn#t goes in that deep.
16:51 < Madara> And I need an english book
16:51 < Madara> Cause mine is shit.
16:51 < fisted> well there are shitty books, too :)  the topic of ##C++ on freenode might have some recommendations
16:57 <@minus> More Effective C++ by Scott Meyers is nice
16:57 <@minus> hurr
16:59 < fisted> but does it teach Expert C++ Knowledge(TM) like `arrays are pointers',  `int is 32bit';  does it reveal the nifty details on the sizeof() function, and the like?
16:59 < fisted> thankfully we have tutorials to fill in these gaps books commonly leave
17:00 <@minus> :D
