20:43 < LittleWhite> ... 
21:30 < tyurd> minus: yes
22:39 < heinrich5991> Edible: .......
22:39 < heinrich5991> that's not exactly helpful
22:48 < Edible> heinrich5991, is it? i think its probably the most helpful answer you could ever give in regards to ubuntu
22:48 < heinrich5991> I don't think so
22:49 < heinrich5991> you might as well just tell everybody to install your favorite flavor of linux/bsd
22:49 < Edible> well, that's like, your opinion man
22:50 < Edible> I can do that?
22:50 < Edible> tyurd, install debian
22:50 < Edible> problem solved
22:51 < heinrich5991> do you think your advice helps them? what do you think they would say?
22:53 < Edible> probably nothing, probably leave, probably a nice debate on which OS is better. nothing really will change anyway
22:55 <@minus> you could get kicked for being a dick
22:56 < lvgx> I should use that reason in tw
22:57 < Edible> a year ago i asked about windows 8, i got the same answer
22:57 < Edible> turns out im the dick today
22:57 < Edible> make up your minds
22:58 < Edible> but anyway, it was a dick answer. i admit it. if you want to kick me go ahead.
22:59 < urraka> he didnt even ask a useful question, cant expect a helpful answer
22:59 <@minus> indeed
