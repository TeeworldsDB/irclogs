00:45 <@heinrich5991> Whis: do you not know what email you associated to your account or do you not know your email password?
10:42 <@minus> heinrich5991: do not change or give out the email, reset the password or delete the account if you are not absolutely sure he is the owner of the account. in this case the account had activity from this year and was wuite obviously Czech while Whis was most likely German
10:42 <@heinrich5991> okay, I thought it might be fine to give out the email. will not do that then
10:44 <@minus> if he could offer a short list of possible email addresses of which one matches, then maybe. but at that point a password reset will give him access anyway
