11:05 < Dunedune> hello there!
11:06 < Dunedune> does anyone have an idea on how I can send a file from a ssh session to my local computer? I've tried half a dozen of ways and I have to submit the file before 12:00 :(
11:06 < Dunedune> mail doesn't work, mailx doesn't work, using links and uploading file somewhere doesn't work, download through ssh doesn't work... I know it's offtopic but I can't figure that out ><
11:12 < EastByte> are you on linux?
11:12 < Dunedune> ye
11:12 < EastByte> then use scp or rsync
11:13 < Dunedune> i use two ssh :/
11:13 < Dunedune> i'm trying to make these work atm
11:13 < EastByte> two ssh?
11:14 < Dunedune> ok I can bypass that
11:14 < Dunedune> yeah I use ssh tunnels
11:14 < Dunedune> I ssh on a remote machine :p
11:14 < EastByte> so?
11:14 < Dunedune> hm, well I have no idea how to use scp in that case
11:15 < EastByte> just use scp in the same way as ssh
11:15 < EastByte> well I'm confused
11:16 < EastByte> you are using ssh tunnels to ssh to another machine?
11:16 < Dunedune> well the idea is that [my computer] ---> [remote server] -> [remote server]
11:16 < Dunedune> yeah
11:17 < EastByte> remote server2 -> your computer
11:17 < Dunedune> I can only acess remoteserver2 from remoteserver1
11:18 < EastByte> so you mean on ssh session of remote server1 you can connect to remoteserver 2
11:18 < EastByte> or using the tunnel?
11:26 < Dunedune> I think I'm just stupid
11:26 < Dunedune> I can just scp from remote server 2 to remote server 1
11:27 < Dunedune> then scp from remote server 1 to local
11:27 < EastByte> sure :)
11:27 < EastByte> you can also base64 the file and c&p :D
11:28 < Dunedune> I've tried that
11:28 < Dunedune> I managed to base64 it
11:29 < Dunedune> but I can't get the mail to work
11:29 < Dunedune> and what do you mean by cop&paste?
11:29 < EastByte> copy and paste from terminal
11:29 < EastByte> well the file might be just too big
11:30 < Dunedune> EastByte: how do you do that oO?
11:31 < EastByte> cat file | base64
11:31 < EastByte> select base64 string with mouse
11:31 < EastByte> c&p
11:31 < EastByte> depends on what terminal you are using
11:31 < XXLTomate> or upload the file on remote server 2 to an ftp server you have access to
11:32 < Dunedune> I tried that too
11:32 < Dunedune> but ftp command isn't installed
11:32 < Dunedune> EastByte: oooh I get it, smart
11:32 < Dunedune> well, scp did the job, thanks still :)
11:35 < XXLTomate> oh, at least it worked now :-)
