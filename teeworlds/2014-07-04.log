00:20 < PsychoGod> i check algorithm.h ... there is not done function, sort_quick, would it be soon? have some ideas about sort algorithm ?
00:21 <@matricks> PsychoGod: that function will be written when it's needed :)
00:21 < PsychoGod> fine :3
00:21 <@matricks> you have loads of questions about the code :)
00:22 < PsychoGod> yeah, i'm learning it, it would be great to build new game, besides to check some issues
00:29 < PsychoGod> timsort, our choose :3
00:29 <@matricks> ?

00:32 <@matricks> was just going to say that it looks like a merge sort...
00:32 <@matricks> and it is :)
00:32 <@matricks> hybrid thingie
00:32 < PsychoGod> yeap, looks great
00:32 < PsychoGod> need work to translate to C
00:33 < PsychoGod> original is Python, can find on java
00:33 <@matricks> what are you going to sort?
00:33 < PsychoGod> 16 teamplayers xD
00:34 <@matricks> ..
00:34 <@matricks> the bubble sort might be faster :)
00:36 <@matricks> you need larger sets for timsort
00:36 < PsychoGod> yeah, dunno what to do to use this sort xD
00:37 <@matricks> https://github.com/gfx/cpp-TimSort
00:37 <@matricks> c++ implementation
00:39 < PsychoGod> trully, not needed :) but good for using in big projects
00:40 <@matricks> meh
00:47 <@matricks> only place in teeworlds that needs a sort of larger data is the server browser
00:47 <@matricks> you seldom need to sort stuff in a game actually
00:49 <@matricks> some times, it's more useful to make sure that everything is sorted to begin with
00:50 < PsychoGod> i thought about sorting while automap or generated some parts
00:50 <@matricks> ?
00:51 <@matricks> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/base/tl/sorted_array.h
00:51 <@matricks> that is kinda good
00:52 <@matricks> normal array that just inserts the stuff sorted to begin with
00:52 < PsychoGod> yeah, it's good, nevermind about maps, that's was fault :D
01:28 <@matricks> time for ze bed
01:28 < PsychoGod> yeah, good night ;)
