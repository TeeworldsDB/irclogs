09:42 < bridge> <AssassinTee> @chillerdragon nope still broken btw
09:59 < ChillerDragon> omg no
09:59 < ChillerDragon> how
09:59 < ChillerDragon> and why can i not reproduce it at all!?
09:59 < ChillerDragon> i have seen the issue once when porting the ddnet client to 0.7 but i fixed it there and it always worked fine for gctf on my machine -.-
10:00 < ChillerDragon> do you see it only for other tees or also for your own tee? @AssassinTee
10:03 < ChillerDragon> omg fuck yeah
10:03 < ChillerDragon> i can now reproduce :D 
10:37 < bridge> <AssassinTee> yes, you might have noticed, that I am twice on that screenshot and dragging a dummy
11:09 < ChillerDragon> ye
11:28 < bridge> <AssassinTee> my guess is that you made the flag follow the player instead of setting a flag for the player, that he has a flag
11:49 < ChillerDragon> @AssassinTee @AssassinTee
11:49 < ChillerDragon>  @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee @AssassinTee
11:49 < ChillerDragon> client side `cl_predict_players 1` fixed it for me lol?
11:49 < ChillerDragon> is that off by default?
11:50 < ChillerDragon> trol 0.7
11:51 < ChillerDragon> ok but yea i still should be able to fix it server side. I do not need predict players on vanilla ctf servers hmmm
11:51 < ChillerDragon> on it
11:52 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I am known to break stuff with settings
11:53 < bridge> <AssassinTee> how dare me use a library fully
11:53 < ChillerDragon> youd didnt break anything
11:53 < ChillerDragon> neither should it need that setting so im still searching for a better fix
11:53 < ChillerDragon> but at least thats a working hotfix :) 
11:54 < ChillerDragon> not that anyone cares gctf has like 0 players and my gctf server has even less ._.
11:56 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I meant in general
11:56 < bridge> <AssassinTee> I am the type of person who tries something, for example Keras for machine learning, and finds a bug within 5 minutes
11:57 < bridge> <AssassinTee> If you ever need a tester ask me, I'll break it
11:59 < ChillerDragon> very nice ill back to you on that
11:59 < ChillerDragon> get
12:00 < ChillerDragon> omg i need to buy irc pro to finally be able to edit messages
13:40 < ChillerDragon> got it! thanks so much for testing assa :)
