14:01 < rand> I have never seen easter eggs in teeworlds before :o
15:05 < Dune> Happy Easter rand :o
17:23 < wavi> Wow I was surprised about that too :D
18:55 < Dune> hi, hope all is fine
18:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> didn't find any at the bot of ctf5, so works fine i guess
18:56 < Dune> wavi: how is teeaster in finland :)
18:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Itâ€™s ok but not perfect. It triggers my ocd when the eggs fly in the air
18:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Is it still not fixed? xD
18:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I remember complaining about this a year ago (exactly?)
18:58 < Dune> you mean, when they're triggered above death tiles in the bottom of ctf5?
19:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes and this looks fixed (in 0.7)
19:01 < Oy> hey
19:02 < Oy> happy easter :)
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> happy easter ðŸ™‚ but isn't eastern at Sunday?
19:05 < Oy> dunno if i'm around then
19:14 < ChillerDragun> we still load the winter theme by default huh? Isnt it time to replace it by a summer theme?
19:16 < Oy> there's no summer one
19:16 < Oy> but heavens will do
19:17 < Dune> ChillerDragon: that's the 074 theme
19:18 < Dune> Oy: in past releases I think we would force a change to the new theme btw
19:20 < Oy> ?
19:22 < Dune> changing the default will only affect people who install teeworlds just now
19:23 < Oy> yeah
19:23 < Dune> I think that's not what we did in the past, just saying
19:23 < Oy> hm, don't think we forced that winter theme
19:31 < Dune> ah, right :)
19:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> thanks for updating the theme winter is the worst ðŸ˜„
19:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> can't you change the theme in settings?
19:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its annoying to do that all the time
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i switch os and device and so one quite often
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> that hurt
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> ðŸ˜„
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its urs?
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its not the theme
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i dislike winter graphics in games
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> execpt the winter map in modern combat black pegasus ofc
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its like ctf5 of modern combat
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune about the eggs they also spawn above textures that are smaller than one tiles and thus float. Like Edges of crass or the dirt that has transparency
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Usually a good hack for that is mirroring doodads on the y axies
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> axis*
19:50 < wavi> Dune, it's pretty standard, not a very big event but some people do celebrate it, with various easter props. Not very visible this year you can imagine
19:51 < Dune> do you hide eggs in the forest, wavi? 
19:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @ChillerDragon they also spawn on invisible blocks if they have a hitbox, whats the point?
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> The point is that it looks weird
19:52 < wavi> not as far as I know but some people hide them around the house or maybe even in the garden
19:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I hide them in my jeans
20:51 < rand> *two days later, after doing the laundry* shiiiiiiiiit
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Yep I feel you ðŸ˜„
21:35 < Dune> hey @fokkonaut do you still get trouble with "oy's assert" on the current master? :)
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ddnet7 servers are in big trouble because of the vanilla assert being so strict
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Is there any reason that assert was added? I mean would it be bad if we just remove it?
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I get it sometimes on my server, maybe it was just my stupidness, no idea whether it would happen in vanilla
21:36 < Dune> it used to cause trouble with dummies
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I suggest keeping it, but adding an ingame check for the netserver.send
21:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i suggest this check https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L524
21:37 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/c68402fa7e279d42886d5951d1ea8ac2facc1ea5 fixes the dummy crash though 
21:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> here too https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L530
21:38 < Dune> which line is this bad assert already?
21:38 < Dune> network_server.cpp: three hundred something iirc
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> wait a sec
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> that commit is stupid
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> should have been done the way I suggested, to keep that stuff there
21:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune the commit of you should fix it already, but i really suggest doing it the other way
22:07 < Oy> nah that would just put invalid messages in the demo
22:39 < Learath2> eeeh, should we maybe be disabling asserts on release builds? or maybe introducing some kind of critical assert that crashes and others don't, oooor maybe not use asserts for things that are not critical but just log instead?
22:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think having asserts in release builds is fine
22:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it catches bugs and makes bugs potentially less bad (rce â†’ dos)
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well dos is a bigger problem in tw than rce but i get your point
