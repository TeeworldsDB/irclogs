12:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Can Santee fix the missing corner on ctf5?
12:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> It's just a corner but my OCD goes through the roof
12:04 < Dune> that would mess the mapchecker
12:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> true
12:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> dm7 has a few (multiple) bugs, too
12:15 < Dune> they might already be fixed in the teeworlds-maps repo
12:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> what corner on ctf5
12:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> middle, left side, background
12:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> should i send a screenshot?
12:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> ah you mean the cave tiles?
12:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes
12:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> thanks for the report, gonna fix 'em
12:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> dm7 is already fixed I believe
12:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i don't believe so
12:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> one bug is hidden behind a shotgun, and the other is hard to see
12:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> both times the doodads
12:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> It was fixed after the 0.7.3 release
12:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> kk ‚ù§Ô∏è
12:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> can i download the map somewhere and check?
12:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> guess the reop
12:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> repo
12:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-maps
12:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> sure, let me know
12:27 < Dune> you cannot used modified standard maps
12:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i can download and rename them
12:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> just to check
12:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Great work on the dev journals Dune üôÇ
12:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> still found a bug
12:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> good, send a screenshot üôÇ
12:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <n000b> Yeah the santee journals are awesome
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Ryozuki, now with the command support, why does the client need to send a command Msg when using a command? I thought it was for autocompletion
12:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Sonix https://i.imgur.com/bzg0wcE.jpg
12:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> doy ou see the gap under the white line?
12:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> You are able to see it with dyn and 4:3
12:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> to be extremly picky xD
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune yeah probs to the journal, i love it ‚ù§Ô∏è
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> gonna fix it
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> should i report this really picky bugs?
12:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> if they're visible in game yeah
12:41 < Dune> <3 
12:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and if they are not visible?
12:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ctf5 has one that really bothers me its barley visible but when unhook layer is hidden it cant be unseen
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> how can it bother you if you can't see it
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> when editing the map or looking closly
12:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> check it out hide unhook its top blue spawn
12:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> @Assa can you check if everything is alright now?
12:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I pmd you
12:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I've just updated the repo, make sure to re-download them again
13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune `I feel like some people don't realize that they don't need to change the code to distribute a mod icon.`
13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ?
13:21 < Dune> bridge: hm?
13:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what do you mean by this?
13:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> If i make mod-icons all clients that want to use it have to download it, right?
13:27 < Dune> yes
13:27 < Dune> but you don't need to modify the client itself
13:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> are there any wildcards? (probably not)
13:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i* -> ictf, idm, itdm; g* -> gctf, gdm, whatever
13:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> okay, str_no_comp ^^
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> filesystems don't like *
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the windows file system doesn't like * üòâ
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but it can be convinced to create a file with that name
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> although it's hard to access it with standard tools then
14:49 < Dune> ahoy!

16:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and the sunglases
16:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> is this a mistake?

16:19 < Dune> day: and a third ping for ya!
16:24 < Oy> version server has to be updated?
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> is there any server with the custom message support yet?
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe dune tested it, otherwise no
16:29 < Dune> oh right
16:29 < Dune> @hei
16:29 < Dune> heinrich5991: need to update that
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ÔºÉ6909> Ig was not countdown to christmas, it was countdown to christeemas
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ÔºÉ6909> It
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> basically lied about the countdown being for the 0.7.4 release and not christeemas ._.
17:00 <@heinrich5991> Dune: should be running now
17:08 < Oy> hm, the new version info doesn't show up
17:08 < Oy> heinrich5991: are there 2 version server?
17:08 <@heinrich5991> yes, there are two version servers running
17:09 < Oy> ok
17:09 <@heinrich5991> one on port 8285, one on port 8302
17:09 <@heinrich5991> I only started the one on 8285, should I kill (/update?) the one on 8302?
17:10 < Oy> the one on 8285 is the one for 0.7
17:10 < Oy> did u rebuild that one?
17:10 <@heinrich5991> yes
17:11 < Oy> ok
17:11 <@heinrich5991> $ strings versionsrv | grep -F 0.7
17:11 <@heinrich5991> verg0.7.4
17:11 <@heinrich5991> # Teeworlds 0.7.4
17:11 < Oy> anyone know if it worked before?
17:13 <@heinrich5991> it worked in 0.6 times ^^
17:13 < Oy> :D
17:13 < Oy> on start menu there should be a new version note on the bottom when running 0.7.3 client
17:14 <@heinrich5991> I don't have that on my distribution's outdated 0.7.3.1 client
17:15 < Oy> ok
17:15 <@heinrich5991> hm
17:15 <@heinrich5991> I'll fire up wireshark
17:27 < Oy> client sends https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/versionsrv/versionsrv.h#L16 but doesn't get sth
17:32 <@heinrich5991> I only see a connect packet, not that packet
17:32 <@heinrich5991> from the client
17:32 <@heinrich5991> but no response
17:35 < Oy> maybe the token request?
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that one
17:35 < Oy> and doesn't send a token?
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no, I don't see a response
17:36 < Oy> ok
17:37 < Oy> only change since last version was https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/af25e7a70f51f02e7e534cdbe76cff3e41cb2801#diff-8eb46215dc1c1880cf00b8ae9f59f1cf but doubt that's it
17:41 <@heinrich5991> the tcpdump on version.teeworlds.com also sees the UDP packets, but there are no responses
17:41 <@heinrich5991> afk for a bit
17:43 < Oy> ok
17:43 < Oy> tested with a local version server, there it works
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> whats this tool used for?
17:55 < Oy> to show old clients that a new version is out
17:56 < Dune> someone on linux mint can't start teeworlds from the desktop, but it works from console
17:56 < Dune> 64 bit everything
17:57 < Dune> I wonder if that's a nemo bug (the file browser)
17:57 < Dune> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/658710841012650015/658714653920067595/0.4.png teeworlds is no longer detected as an executable in nemo
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> chmod 777
17:58 < Dune> i can already ./teeworlds it
17:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> tried rebooting?
17:59 < Dune> this isn't windows
18:01 < Dune> heinrich5991: you know some lightweight file browser for linux? konqueror is fat
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Lower min. mousesens
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> wat
18:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> i use this on arch https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/Files
18:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> its rly simple
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> ah its named Nautilus
18:03 < Dune> heh, same issue
18:03 < Dune> ah, it suggest me to make it executable
18:04 < Dune> ‚ùØ stat -c "%a %n" teeworlds755 teeworlds
18:04 < Dune> so it has to be executable for other users to be displayed as an executable? that is strange
18:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune @Ryozuki when some of the commands are removed, but not every, and you then try to select another command with the arrow keys, the client still thinks the old commands are there, so if you for example only remove "team", then you need to press down 2 times when you reach that place
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @LordSk the youtube video is awesome üòÑ
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> big thumbs up
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> thanks!
18:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> open a issue then
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/658724418780135450/Bildschirmfoto_2019-12-23_um_18.34.55.png
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> macOs
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> that symbol is normal
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if you click on it it makes the browser bigger
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it looks kinda out of place or like a bug xD
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thats what i thought too
18:37 <@heinrich5991> Dune: I use thunar (from xfce). I heard some people use ranger (terminal based file browser)
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/658724983651958816/unknown.png
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> for me the same @jxsl13
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/658725049351667731/unknown.png
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if clicked
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I know ._. I can click
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> o, really?
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *has the ability to use a mouse/trackpad*
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> :O
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> üòÆ
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> teach me
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> don't have that much time, it's more than 10 years of practice
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oof
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ok
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm hm
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> heinrich5991: thanks, it doesn't seem file browser related
21:57 < day> Dune: hey ho :)
22:00 < Dune> hei :)
22:00 < day> whats up, why the pings?
22:00 < Dune> because your name is coincidentally a common english noun :D
22:01 < day> 16:19 < Dune> day: and a third ping for ya!
22:02 < Dune> well I noticed there were two pings in the previous sentence
22:02 < day> ah
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> is axblk here?
22:02 < day> i only get pinged when a sentences starts with day
22:02 < Dune> ooh interesting
22:02 < day> so i assumed there were 2 more outside of my backlog
22:02 < Dune> sorry then :p
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> does anyone know how to set the players race time for the new race support?
22:02 < Dune> redix might
22:02 < day> np. you can always ping me <3
22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> when a player enters the server and he finished the map already, he should get his time displayed already. how does that work?
22:03 < Dune> aw :3
22:03  * rand ping day
22:03  * rand flies away
22:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune ?
22:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> There is a snapitem for the player race stuff
22:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i know
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but not for its current score
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (time)
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i cant find it at least
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Ah no... If gameflag_race is set the score is used as time
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> It uses milliseconds
22:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oh wait
22:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> let me try something
