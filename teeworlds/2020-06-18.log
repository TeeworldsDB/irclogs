12:21 < ChillerDragon> Yo @Learath2 any idea why I can not build your pr anymore? https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/832551693/teewu6.png master works fine and even on my older deb9 vps it works fine
12:21 < ChillerDragon> woops wrong link
12:21 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/XV
12:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Which PR is this? I have like 6 open ðŸ˜„
12:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Ah the ddnet one, it requires python3 now
12:22 < ChillerDragon> dd_pr_07
12:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I generate the protocol for 0.7 and 0.6 for which I used modules, not available in py2
12:23 < ChillerDragon> yes but why does it find the python3 version on my deb9 and on laws deb10 machine but not on my deb10 laptop?
12:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> do you have python3?
12:23 < ChillerDragon> sure
12:23 < ChillerDragon> python is linked to python3 but python3 is installed
12:24 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1592475857.png
12:24 < ChillerDragon> does that image preview on discord btw?
12:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> yep it does
12:24 < ChillerDragon> nice
12:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Hm, I think this is the reason cmake deprecated the old FindPythonInterp
12:25 < ChillerDragon> ah nice i hacked it
12:25 < ChillerDragon> rm -rf * solved it
12:25 < ChillerDragon> probably old cmake cache did not like the git pull
12:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ah
12:26 < ChillerDragon> I feel to git pro nowerdays :D so I stopped rececloning everytime i have issues :D
12:26 < ChillerDragon> too*
12:27 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 any plans for skin support?
12:28 < ChillerDragon> oh wait we are in #teeworlds thought we are on ddnet my bad sry
12:29 < ChillerDragon> oh btw like share subscribe review and fix https://github.com/github/explore/pull/1555
12:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well I support whatever skins timakro supports
12:30 < ChillerDragon> timakros skin support is useless to me but still better than what u have implemented right now
12:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You know it's impossible to support all skins, right?
12:30 < ChillerDragon> Its literally all tees having default skin
12:30 < ChillerDragon> yea but the main skins would be nice
12:31 < ChillerDragon> or at least default skins
12:31 < ChillerDragon> but lets #ddnet
17:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I can't seem to match colors between 0.7 and 0.6 no matter what I do, it's so weird
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I spent many days trying to fix up Teecomp yeah
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> something is odd
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> the range of lightnesses allowed in 0.7 seems greater, yet I can't seem to convert between the two
17:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> 0.6 clamps it from 0.5 to 1, tried remapping it to the whole range and map that to 0.7 colors but that didn't seem to nail it either
