19:43 < tomew> any1 able to help me install archlinux?
19:44 < heinrich5991> what's your question?
19:45 < tomew> im using the latest virtualbox & archlinux version and follow this (german) videopodcast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxBN21bsVqU
19:45 < tomew> but when im executing "pacman -Syu" im getting weird errors like "I/O errors" etc
19:46 < heinrich5991> tyurderi: when do you run pacman -Syu?
19:46 < tyurderi> after first start of archlinux
19:47 < tyurderi> and "loadkeys de" but i dont think this is relevant
19:47 < heinrich5991> ah, so after finishing the install and rebooting to the system?
19:47 < tyurderi> nah, installing never finished
19:47 < tyurderi> becuz it fails xd
19:47 < heinrich5991> so you're doing this in the installer?
19:47 < heinrich5991> like on the live system from the boot disk?
19:47 < tyurderi> yea
19:48 < heinrich5991> what's the exact IO error? something with "mounted as read-only"?
19:48 < tyurderi> wait
19:48 < heinrich5991> (I think you're not supposed to run pacman -Syu in the installer)
19:48 < tyurderi> i'll try again
19:50 < tyurderi> "bus error"
19:50 < tyurderi> Buffer I/O error.. oh now its spamming
19:51 < tyurderi> "error on device dm-0, logical block <somenumber>"
19:52 < heinrich5991> have you chrooted into the new install before pacman -Syu-ing?
19:52 < tyurderi> nope, i just followed the video guide
19:52 < heinrich5991> mh.
19:56 < tyurderi> no idea, right?
19:59 < heinrich5991> no idea. I don't think updating the system before bootstrapping it makes sense, so I wonder why your guide tells you to pacman -Syu
20:14 < LittleWhite> Why the installation failed ?
20:14 < tyurderi> im getting weird errors
20:14 < LittleWhite> such as ?
20:14 < tyurderi> as i wrote
20:14 < tyurderi> xd
20:15 <@matricks> tyurderi: you do you join a gaming channel and ask how to install archlinux? O.o
20:15 <@matricks> *why do you
20:15 < tyurderi> at first i wanted to contact botox but he is afk
20:15 < LittleWhite> matricks: +1024
20:15 < tyurderi> but then i was already here
20:15 < tyurderi> and im banned from #linux channel, idk why
20:15 < LittleWhite> because off topying ? :D
20:16 <@matricks> tyurderi: thats like me starting to ask about car repairs in the vegtable section in the super market
20:16 < tyurderi> hehehehehehehehehehe
20:16 < xXDARKXx> lol
20:16 < LittleWhite> matricks: I always do that
20:16 < LittleWhite> matricks: Never got answer though
20:16 <@matricks> you could probably find a better place to ask and get better answers
20:17 <@matricks> in.. I don't know.. archlinux channel perhaps
20:17 < LittleWhite> +1
20:17 <@matricks> just throwing it out there
20:17 < tyurderi> haha
20:17 < tyurderi> sure
20:17 < tyurderi> thank you anyway xd
22:07 < BotoX> hmm
22:07 < BotoX> That always worked for me though!
22:07 < BotoX> since the arch installer creates a ramdisk and runs there
22:07 < BotoX> and you can actually update that, you can use it like any other normal arch system (until you loose power :D)
