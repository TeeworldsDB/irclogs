12:16 < rand> is it esay to filter all kind of unicode empty space ? (for empty player name)
12:16 < rand> *easy
12:16 <@heinrich5991> ddnet does it (effectively)
12:17 <@heinrich5991> we could copy the code from there
12:17 < rand> neat
12:21 < rand> ddnet has also testsâ€¦
12:22 <@heinrich5991> yes :)
12:22 <@heinrich5991> not a lot though
12:27 < Oy> just have to readd the 0.6 code. listed all possible empty codes back then
12:53 <@Dune> :)
12:56 <@Dune> how is CNetBan::Ban never defined
12:59 <@Dune> Oy: I don't know much about snap, doesn't sound too good to have to add it in teeworlds itself? Flatpak does not require a modification of the teeworlds repo, it has an external config
12:59 <@Dune> Why does snap need it?
12:59 <@Dune> maybe minus knows that stuff
13:06 < minus> snap and flatpak are bad ideas
13:07 < minus> if you package a program like that: congratulations, you're now responsible to ship security updates
13:07 < minus> though it's the same on windows anyway because you have to ship deps

19:14 <@Dune> huh msvc redistributable doesn't help
19:28 < minus> just use mingw and ship the runtime (totally contradicting what i said above :D)
20:28 < Oy> Dune: yeah, then we should probably pass on snap
22:03 <@Dune> yeah and this freetype dll thing is messy, don't they provide stand-alone dlls?
22:09 < Oy> they link to a compiled version https://www.freetype.org/download.html https://github.com/ubawurinna/freetype-windows-binaries
22:10 < Oy> the one present in the 0.6 branch i compiled myself back then
22:11 < Oy> if that one works, i'd give it a try again
