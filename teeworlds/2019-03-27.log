01:55 <@heinrich5991> Dune: json or x-www-form-urlencoded?
01:57 <@heinrich5991> added it with json payload for now, tell me if I need to change it
01:58 <@heinrich5991> Dune: there's no one listening on port 8045
09:49 <@Dune> heinrich5991: yeah json. And i shut it down 
09:49 <@Dune> You need to link secrets though 
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we're getting a `download.py: error: argument TARGET: invalid choice: 'x86_64' (choose from 'sdl', 'freetype')` over here with @Fudgy, looks strange, doesn't it?
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I assume that is because `download.py` no longer takes a `--arch` parameter
