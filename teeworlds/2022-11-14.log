07:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> Maybe osu
10:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> osu is fully open-source?
10:30 < ChillerDragon> Idk im not a osu player but i got this recommended on github https://github.com/ppy/osu
10:30 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1668418234.png
10:30 < ChillerDragon> looks pretty promising to me
10:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> probably the biggest FOSS around then
21:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> only osu laser or so
21:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> not the original one
