15:02 < bridge_> [freenode] <seabass[m]> chillerdragon, is your server on a cloud VPS?
15:02 < bridge_> [freenode] <seabass[m]> I wondered whether maybe you have changed cloud region recently; my ping has changed.
17:51 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> its at digitalocean i doubt they move it but maybe idk
17:53 < bridge_> [freenode] <seabass[m]> heh, I think it's my continually poor connection; it's fine now :D
17:54 < bridge_> [freenode] <seabass[m]> I really am stumped by this LAN problem...
