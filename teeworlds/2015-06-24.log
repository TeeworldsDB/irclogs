06:12 < FLummie> just found out about your game today, good work devs. I see u put a lot of effort into this.
06:12 < FLummie> Wish u all the best.
15:34 < Savander> any tips, how to save property graphics from illustrator to the best work with Teeworlds?
15:35 <@minus> 8bit per channel RGBA PNG probably
15:42 < Savander> in 8 bit per channel, teeworlds can't open it
15:46 <@matricks> wat
15:46 <@matricks> almost all images in teeworlds are 8bit per channel RGBA PNG
15:47 < Savander> so maybe i just misunderstand illustrator settings
15:47 < Savander> png-8 means 8 bits i guess
15:47 < Savander> png-24 24 bits
15:47 <@matricks> could be yes
15:47 <@matricks> png-24 == RGB, 8 bit per channel
15:47 <@matricks> you want png-32
15:47 < Savander> so, doesn't exists.. meh
15:48 <@matricks> it' should also be known that adobe products in generall have been really bad at png-files
15:48 < Savander> so maybe hm, just save it in svg
15:48 < Savander> then open in inkscape and save it there
15:58 < Savander> yes, it looks better via inkscape
17:58 <@minus> png-8 is probably using a palette
19:28 < heinrich5991> minus: vbox handles disk full gracefully
19:28 < heinrich5991> it pauses the VM and tells the user to free some space
19:29 <@minus> it's the exception to the rule ;)
19:35 < Dunedune> linux handles RAM ungracefully
19:36 < Dunedune> it pauses the machine and forces the user to cut power off :<
19:37 <@minus> enable sysrq magic and hit alt+print+f
19:37 <@minus> forces an OOM kill
19:38 <@minus> or wait for a few minutes for linux to do an OOM kill on its own
19:39 < Dunedune> good tip, thx
19:39 < Dunedune> spent an afternoon last week trying to bugfix
19:40 < Dunedune> compile -> test -> reboot pc; loop
19:44 <@minus> make -j?
19:48 < heinrich5991> minus: sysrq magic doesn't work for me in OOM situations
19:49 <@minus> heinrich5991: sure that sysrq is enabled?
19:49 <@minus> you also might have to raw-mode your keyboard
19:50 <@minus> sysrq magic + r
19:50 < heinrich5991> "Magische S-Abf-Taste"
19:52 <@minus> sysctl kernel.sysrq=1
20:46 < MertenNor> heinrich5991: any updates for for mac on steam ?
20:53 < heinrich5991> MertenNor: no, not really
20:53 < heinrich5991> I'm not sure why it would run with an appdir but not without
20:53 < MertenNor> yeah idk its weird.. 
20:54 < MertenNor> can you make it so that the steam installer installs one ?
20:54 < MertenNor> heinrich5991: ^
20:55 < heinrich5991> I don't think so
20:55 < MertenNor> hm.. 
20:55 < heinrich5991> but I should probably bundle freetype and stuff, not doing that right now
20:56 < MertenNor> ah ok.. just let me know when its done so I can test it.. 
20:56 < MertenNor> just send me a PM via the forum
