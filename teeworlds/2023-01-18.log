17:59 < bridge> <Dune> this guy wrote a spam post in the forum: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/profile.php?id=124735
18:00 < bridge> <Dune> registered in *2013* holy
18:06 < bridge> <chillerdragon> lol
18:47 < bridge> <Stiopa> the dedication
18:47 < bridge> <Stiopa> fr tho, maybe some accounts made in 2013 and put on forums and then sold to a scammer now? I don't know
18:47 < bridge> <Stiopa> but I like to think someone was just that dedicated
18:47 < bridge> <Robyt3> maybe it's just a stolen account from some data leak
19:06 < deen> Dune: We have the same issue on DDNet forum, many legitimate users are suddenly posting spam. I think easy passwords or malware on their systems, maybe some of the Discord scams
19:13 < bridge> <Dune> deen: ah, I see
19:13 < bridge> <Dune> probably more automated use of data breaches
19:14 < deen> Googling for the spam links I find lots of forums having the same issue: https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?p=15919581
19:32 < bridge> <Dune> oh yeah I've seen the exact same spam posts on some other french forums
