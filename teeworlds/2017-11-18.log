03:23 < daey> Stitch626: theres no touch device attached. i doubt its a sense issue. the cursor position basically is pulled to the upper left and limited by the 'cursor circle'. you can still slightly influence its position by violently pulling your mouse around (which makes the cursor twitch a little into that direction, but it shoots right back
03:23 < daey> i've played around with the sense already as well
11:25 < pinkieval> great, another ddos
