09:59 < Safa_[A_boy]> Hello, Where is the script that convert the po file to a json file?
09:59  * Safa_[A_boy] no plurals in po :(
10:20 < Safa_[A_boy]> The %s flag was captured by '%s'
10:20 < Safa_[A_boy]> What if the translation should be flipped?
10:21 < Safa_[A_boy]> someone captured the flag, not the flag was captured by someone
10:27 < heinrich5991> Safa_[A_boy]: try this http://netcup.heinrich5991.de/temp/reconvert_l10n.py
10:28 < heinrich5991> what do you mean by 'no plurals' in po?
10:28 < heinrich5991> the last thing is unfortunately not possible with the current system
10:33 < Safa_[A_boy]> %d players left
10:33 < Safa_[A_boy]> Some languages have more than 2 forms...
10:33 < heinrich5991> yes, as said, it's not possible with the currenty i10n system in teeworlds
10:33 < heinrich5991> *current
10:34 < heinrich5991> it doesn't understand plurals at all at the moment
10:35 < Safa_[A_boy]> Then the current system don't support nethier plurals or changing placeholders places..
10:35 < Safa_[A_boy]> Thats bad :\
10:36 < heinrich5991> yes.
10:36 < heinrich5991> maybe you can make an issue about that in the teeworlds github repo?
10:40 < Safa_[A_boy]> I made one for RTL support, but there is no good response from the developers... So I'm frustrated
10:40  * Safa_[A_boy] bad English...
10:40 <@minus> python str.format style: {capturer} captured the {flag_color} flag
10:41 < Safa_[A_boy]> minus: It can be in python, but what about lua?
10:41 < heinrich5991> Safa_[A_boy]: RTL support is much harder, I tried it a week ago. 'just' incorporating a different translation system should be easier
10:42 <@minus> how about excorporating a translation system?
10:42 < heinrich5991> :)
10:42 <@matricks> o/
10:42 <@minus> that one summoned matricks
10:42 < heinrich5991> translation is a PITA from a dev perspective, but it's great to have it
10:42 <@matricks> been reading all the time :)
10:43 <@matricks> localization in general is a pain
10:44 < heinrich5991> but I think pain doesn't mean we should remove it :)
10:45 <@minus> TIL heinrich5991 is a masochist
10:45 < heinrich5991> minus: UI is also pain, most of the time :P
10:45 <@matricks> remove that
10:45 < heinrich5991> ;)
10:45 <@matricks> teeworlds.exe connect myserver
10:46 <@minus> $ teeworlds "connect 1.3.3.7" already works
10:46 < Safa_[A_boy]> I can warp-around the RTL by flipping the translation, but at least let the sentences be aligned Right. It's not hard huh?
10:47 < heinrich5991> Safa_[A_boy]: it took me an hour or so to align everything to the right
10:47 < heinrich5991> but then you have to make an option, and support different text directions for nicks, chat messages, etc.
10:48 < heinrich5991> the console should always be left-to-right, for example
10:48 < heinrich5991> while it might still contain RTL text
10:49 < heinrich5991> which means I'd need to get in some unicode functions, for getting the RTL type of a character
10:49 < heinrich5991> it's not that easy..
10:49 < Safa_[A_boy]> It's easy for me
10:50 < heinrich5991> ?
10:50 < Safa_[A_boy]> a string containing 'LTR' tells the translators to set it to RTL or leave it as it is
10:50 < Safa_[A_boy]> and a if statement should do the rest
10:50 < Safa_[A_boy]> an*
10:52 < heinrich5991> Safa_[A_boy]: what about the scoreboard? should it be mirrored?
10:53 < heinrich5991> what about the nicks in the scoreboard?
10:53 < Safa_[A_boy]> I think that if the scoreboard mirrored, the whole UI should be mirrored
10:53 < heinrich5991> yea, I mirrored the whole UI
10:53 < heinrich5991> but then I had problems with 1) server names and 2) nicks
10:54 < heinrich5991> and maybe 3) the console
10:54 < Safa_[A_boy]> console? It is in English, so I think no need to mirror ir
10:54 < Safa_[A_boy]> it*
10:54 < heinrich5991> yes, in english
10:54 < heinrich5991> ok, right, console seems fixable
10:55 < Safa_[A_boy]> We don't mirror the console in Gnu/Linux
10:55 < heinrich5991> oh, you don't? ok
10:55 < Safa_[A_boy]> Most of the commands are in English
10:55  * Safa_[A_boy] or maybe All
10:56 < heinrich5991> ok, leaving nicks
10:56 < heinrich5991> Safa_[A_boy]: should I display nicks left-to-right or right-to-left?
10:57 < heinrich5991> because latin nicks look bad right-to-left, and I guess the others look bad left-to-right
10:57 < Safa_[A_boy]> left-to-right
10:58 < heinrich5991> if that's fine, I think I could land such a pull request in near future
10:58 < Safa_[A_boy]> And I would be pleased to check that ^_^
11:04 < heinrich5991> Safa_[A_boy]: another problem :( numbers
11:16 < heinrich5991> Safa_[A_boy]: do you have an idea for this? there's e.g. a label 'Size: %d'. I can't just RTL this, as the number will be reversed too
11:17 < Safa_[A_boy]> ...
11:17 < heinrich5991> ?
12:01 < Safa_[A_boy]> heinrich5991: Why would that happen?
12:01 < heinrich5991> well
12:01 < Safa_[A_boy]> You will algin it only
12:01 < heinrich5991> the string "Size: 100" is passed to the rendering function
12:01 < heinrich5991> I told it to RTL
12:02 < heinrich5991> so it outputs, aligned to the right: "001 :eziS"
12:02 < Safa_[A_boy]> Why would you do that?
12:02 < Safa_[A_boy]> I'll make a picture, wait please...
12:10 < Safa_[A_boy]> heinrich5991: http://oi60.tinypic.com/vgn7gn.jpg
12:13 < heinrich5991> Safa_[A_boy]: but as I understood it, arabic text actually is typed right to left?
12:13 < Safa_[A_boy]> Right
12:13 < heinrich5991> that means, the first character has to be on the right?
12:14 < Safa_[A_boy]> Even,
12:14  * Safa_[A_boy] can heinrich5991 see Arabic characters?
12:14 < Safa_[A_boy]> this is the right word
12:14 < Safa_[A_boy]> مرحبا
12:14 < heinrich5991> yea, I can see this
12:15 < Safa_[A_boy]> this is the way that teeworlds display it
12:15 < heinrich5991> are you sure we see the same?
12:15 < heinrich5991> for me some kind of letter looking like an L is on the left
12:15 < Safa_[A_boy]> اب​ح​رم
12:15 < heinrich5991> now something like a capital i is on the right
12:15 < Safa_[A_boy]> heinrich5991: It's wright
12:15 < Safa_[A_boy]> right*
12:16 < Safa_[A_boy]> In your method, it will be:
12:16 < Safa_[A_boy]> مرح​ب​ا
12:16 < Safa_[A_boy]> (not linked)
12:17 < Safa_[A_boy]> م​رح​ب​ا
12:17 < Safa_[A_boy]> each character is separated from the other
12:18 < Safa_[A_boy]> so no need to mirror the strings, I'll mirror them in th translation file
12:18 < heinrich5991> mh
12:18 < heinrich5991> how does that work with strings that have two replacements?
12:19 < heinrich5991> like %s flag was captured by %s ?
12:19 < heinrich5991> then you'd need to find a way to exchange these two in your sentence too
12:19 <@matricks> I suggest removing that text
12:19 < heinrich5991> matricks: that's a different story I guess - we probably have other strings with two %-formmaters
12:19 < heinrich5991> *formatters
12:21 < Safa_[A_boy]> I'll try to finish the translation today (and the mirroring also)
12:21 < heinrich5991> I'll try to implement RTL as you said
12:21 < heinrich5991> not sure if I'll finish it today though, still have to go to university
12:21 < Safa_[A_boy]> That's a good idea
12:22 < Safa_[A_boy]> NP, Study will :)
14:48 < Safa_[A_boy]> Where are the server filters in 0.7 trunk? I can't find them (in the UI)
15:06 < Safa_[A_boy]> Whats 'lgt'?!
15:08 <@matricks> lightness
15:09 < Safa_[A_boy]> thanks
15:27 <@minus> matricks: how do you like Dart?
15:28 <@minus> optionally typed, that's a very nice point
15:28 <@matricks> not looked into it
15:28 <@matricks> web is all f-ed up
15:29 <@minus> of course
15:32 <@minus> talking about the language itself though. assuming it can be used for system programming
15:33 <@matricks> it can?
15:33 <@minus> i'd assume that
15:33 <@matricks> why do you assume that?
15:33 <@minus> js can be too!
15:34 <@matricks> yeah rite
15:34 <@matricks> perhaps if you want a bad system
15:35 <@minus> :(
15:36 <@minus> the language looks reasonably good though!
15:36 <@minus> syntaxwise
15:36 <@minus> meh, going home
15:38 < Learath2> turkish translation needed some placeholder swapping too 
19:03 < Safa_[A_boy]> Where are the server filters in 0.7 trunk? I can't find them (in the UI)
20:08 < BotoX> https://onion.io/
20:37 <@matricks> :D
20:39 <@matricks> it broken
21:36 < Learath2> very reliable apparently
