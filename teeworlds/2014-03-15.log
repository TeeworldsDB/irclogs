21:09 < JulianAssange> uh
21:09 < JulianAssange> maybe it's only showing to 64player clients
21:43 < BotoX> someone please find me this picture: http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQbWdTLHfGHn49kcOEkIItkea-5SjwPfAYoqXI8ucidVykrr6Wv
21:44 < BotoX> It's from here: http://read-me.su/smena-bootlogo-v-phoenix-bios/
21:44 < BotoX> And I want it as my BIOS splash so badly D:
21:49 <@minus> BotoX: if i had to guess i'd say it's from serial experiments lain
21:49 < BotoX> rly.
21:49 < BotoX> wow
21:49 < BotoX> Now that's pretty obvious
21:49 < BotoX> Or, didn't you watch the show? Because I did.
21:49 <@minus> well, fuck you
21:50 < BotoX> No, I mean if you watched the show then that's pretty fucking obvious that it's lain
21:50 < BotoX> but that doesn't really help too much
21:50 < BotoX> Been looking at pictures for like 15 minutes now
21:50 <@minus> looking for the ascii art specifically?
21:51 < BotoX> It's probably made from a picture
21:51 < BotoX> by the guy himself
21:51 < BotoX> also sent an e-mail to the whois contact
22:39 <@matricks> heinrich5991: http://jennypeng.me/2048/
22:39 < heinrich5991> ahh yea, that's way more fun :D
22:41 < BotoX> lol
22:41 < Edible> why do you even bother. it takes me like 10 seconds to boot
22:42 < BotoX> because
22:42 < BotoX> Also it's only the BIOS splash
22:42 < BotoX> which is only shown for a second max.
22:42 < Edible> ...
22:43 < Edible> why dont you watch the anime, and look for a closeup
22:43 < BotoX> I already watched it
22:43 < BotoX> I e-mailed him and left a comment, I hope that he responds.
22:43 < BotoX> If not I'll just leave it stock
22:47 < Edible> just use this one https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTCpkn6pErvVTjo9J1X8FOoRDcQ0s5Hp55GQa6VoUiZk8utpvmXe0M0Xc6n its better :)
22:47 < Edible> i dont have a 2ascii converter at the moment though
22:47 < BotoX> max filesize is limited to 10KB btw D:
22:47 < Edible> what?
22:47 < BotoX> 640x480 16bit
22:47 < BotoX> https://i.botox.bz/splash.png
22:47 < BotoX> was going to use this
22:48 < BotoX> but it was to big even when I reduced it to 8 colors
22:48 < Edible> its ascii, just convert it
22:48 < BotoX> umm
22:48 < BotoX> BMP 16-bit convert to some other crap, it's an actual picture
22:49 < BotoX> he was just using a picture of ASCII art
22:49 <@minus> lrn2png
22:49 < BotoX> mate
22:49 < BotoX> I am flashing a modded BIOS
22:49 < BotoX> and it only takes 16bit BMPs which it then converts to something different
22:50 < BotoX> nothing I can change
22:50 < BotoX> and the filesize of that can't exceed 10kb.
22:50 < BotoX> NSA logo with 8 colors was 15kb
22:51 < Edible> god, so picky
22:51 < BotoX> obv.
