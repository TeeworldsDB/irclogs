15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there's a naughty 502 right now on teeworlds.com. I don't know what the logs look like
19:34 < minus> i see, on it
19:48 < minus> fixed
19:49 < minus> kottizen must have rebooted the host and some things fucked up
19:50 < minus> the webhook service for updating docs failed to start, and the global webhook service was enabled by accident and blocked the port php uses, thus php failed to start
20:15 <@Dune> rip docs?
20:15 <@Dune> thanks for the fix :)
