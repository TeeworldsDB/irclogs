00:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> on the zCatch discord there is currently the holy war of dyn or not dyn going on. take part in it.
00:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> gn8
00:57 < rand> lulz
00:58 < rand> should be zoom or not zoom, since it's not (yet?) in official client :p
02:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> if you implement zoom (ingame) I will leave forever
06:59 < day> rand: zoom?
07:00 < day> i demand a fixed cam view with dynamic camera viewing range
09:42 < rand> zoom is basically the same that reducing networkclip, players seeing what the server sends, making really fast tees appear suddenly in the window instead of crossing the window's edges
09:45 < rand> day: like increasing the cam field with the player's speed ?
11:10 < day> i dislike dynamic UI's
12:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> is there a function to push in a string into another one?
12:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in tw codebase
12:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> at positon
13:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> str_format?
13:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you mean to insert it at a specific position?
13:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think you have to handroll that
13:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> may I ask what you need it for?
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> either with str_format or with a buffer you fill yourself. Or use std::string's insert function
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Btw, @Dune the bad thing about the advanced server browser is that the entries are more apart from each other
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah, I don't like it so much
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can wrap the current entry by clicking on the header
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Or do you mean the wide view?
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> wide view***
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> the small browser is even worse
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Gotta remove the build badge in the readme eh
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> why's that?
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> isn't it for CI?
16:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> oh, it showed me "Build | Unknown" a while ago, weird
16:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It was updated, didn't notice :)
16:26 < Oy> anyone a sound magician? :)
16:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Fisico ? :)
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @Dune @oy what can i do?
18:12 < Dune> @Fisico I suppose this is related to https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2388 :)
18:13 < Dune> I'll release a gamer update with those this evening, so people can give feedback on your productions
18:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> the menu ones?
18:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i will share the race ones in the issue, is a good place for it i think
18:15 < Dune> all of them
18:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> oO did i sent you the latest race ones?
18:16 < Dune> although the race ones are maybe not ready, you can always disable them in the menus
18:16 < Dune> probably not :)
18:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> let me see
18:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> you don't have ðŸ˜„
18:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> look pm @Dune
18:25 < Oy> yeah, it's about the race sounds :)

22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> where can i find dbg_dummies in the source?
22:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ?
22:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ctrl + shift + f -> type dbg_dummied -> find it.
22:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ctrl + shift + f -> type dbg_dummies -> find it.
22:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you can also use github's search to find code snippets
22:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but only in original repos, not forked ones
22:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> thx
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is anyone watching sentdex?
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> fund his kickstarter then :D
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> couldnt find anything about dbg_dummies
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> only issues and 2 useless lines
22:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Skayland [identifyy host|msg me] `put dbg_dummies <n>` in your server config
22:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it will start the server with n dummies
22:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> or `dbg_dummies n; reload`
22:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> or `dbg_dummies n; reload` in rcon
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah, you were asking specifically about the code source, my bad :)
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you have to grep DbgDummies then
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it will only add dummies if your server has been compiled with debug stuff, release doesn't have dimmies.
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and no auto completion of them in f2
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dummies
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> i know that, what i want to do is use dbg_dummies code to code my own brainless bots
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> i mean, use dbg dummies as example code for something i have in mind
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there isn't much code, but again, search for `DbgDummies`
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> rand has some bot stuff in one of his repos, but I forgot the user and link :'( was nheir rand?
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> server side bots.
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
22:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> then I did not forget :o
