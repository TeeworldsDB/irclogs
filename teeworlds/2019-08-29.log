19:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i didnt read the issue just blindly cherry-picked a ddnet feature xd
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i thought #2202 was about console but it was more general so #2204 might be just garbage not to sure tho
19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh wait #2202 is about hard coding a general bind? @Assa you sure it is even related? xd
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> it's related but now the same
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> it's a logical consequenz
