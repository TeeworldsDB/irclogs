17:46 < chsk> BotoX: y
17:54 < BotoX> why?
18:12 < chsk> BotoX: yep, what do you want to do? c:
18:13 < BotoX> this: https://p.botox.bz/sewa.py
18:14 < chsk> start with fps_max 1
18:15 < chsk> >css
18:15 < BotoX> ya
18:15 < chsk> not sure if textmode does anything on linux, really
18:15 < BotoX> sv_cheats is 0 and fps_max is being limited to a minimum of 30 (or set to 0).
18:16 < BotoX> fps_max 1
18:16 < chsk> right
18:16 < BotoX> and yeah, textmode does work
18:16 < chsk> but it still has huge cpu usage?
18:16 < BotoX> it's okay https://i.botox.bz/1407341796.png
