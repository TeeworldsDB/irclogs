17:28 < necropotame> Concerning the 0.6.4 update, is 0.7 also fixed ? (I know that the specific spoofing problem is fixed)
17:34 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: no
17:42 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: why can't the client just pretend that the server just got older input?
17:44 < necropotame> My idea was that an old input will imply some delay in how is apply this input to the actual game. But It's wrong
17:45 < necropotame> If we can found a way to impact game experience to fake ping, but kept similar experience for true ping, it will solve the problem
17:45 < necropotame> But I've no idea right now :P
17:49 < necropotame> I want to implement in TeeUniverses a visible cliping. Like darker region that show the parts that are not sent by the server
17:50 < necropotame> It will gives some feed back to the client of what happend. Maybe a second circle could be related to the ping to show the prediction limit
17:51 < necropotame> That way someone that use zoom out will notice that there is some sort of prediction problem.
17:52 < necropotame> (Well, it's a kind of fog of war). Even in spectator mode, you can know if there is nothing, or if it's just that the server is not yet aware of your new position
18:37 < needs1> daey: Hi again :)
18:46 < daey> ah :D
18:46 < daey> needs1: ^
21:20 <@heinrich5991> Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '2401:1d80:1010::151' to the list of known hosts.
21:20 <@heinrich5991> IPv6 is here :o
21:22 < EastByte> cool
21:22 < EastByte> my ISP isn't going to support ipv6 any time soon
21:23 < EastByte> because they "didn't run out of ipv4", yet
21:27 <@minus> IPv6 via VPN \o/
21:27 < daey> EastByte: why do you care?
21:30 <@heinrich5991> daey: no more nat
21:30 < EastByte> ^ and I want to be able to directly access my servers over ipv6
21:30 < daey> heinrich5991: you will stil lget one ip from your provider i assume
21:30 <@heinrich5991> you get a /64 net
21:30 < daey> are you sure? :D
21:30 <@heinrich5991> which means you get 2^64 IP addresses for your home network
21:30 <@heinrich5991> yes
21:31 < daey> they cant just give you one? its technically impossible>
21:31 < daey> ?
21:31 <@heinrich5991> why would they though?
21:31 <@heinrich5991> it's explicitly designed this way
21:31 <@minus> heinrich5991: CGNAT?
21:31 <@heinrich5991> not talking about that
21:31 <@minus> k
21:31 <@heinrich5991> but rather the nat of my router
21:32 <@minus> aye
21:32 < daey> heinrich5991: to make you pay for more simple. they kick me off the grid every 24h and give me a new ip. just to fuck with me
21:32 <@heinrich5991> they'll still give you a new /64 prefix every 24 hours
21:32 <@minus> lame
21:32 < EastByte> which is good, but it should be optional
21:32 <@heinrich5991> gets you some privacy
21:32 <@heinrich5991> minus: ^
21:32 <@minus> yeah
21:33 < daey> if it were optional yes
21:33 <@heinrich5991> it's also giving you privacy if it's non-optional
21:33 < daey> ...
21:57 < NanoSlime_> Hi
21:57 < Obani> HI
21:57 < Obani> HOW
21:57 < Obani> ARE
21:57 < Obani> YOU ?
22:09 < NanoSlime_> im good
22:09 < NanoSlime_> you?
22:27 < Stitch626> IPv6 is here? so there is now a master server running in IPv6 mode?
22:27 < Stitch626> D:
22:28 <@minus> no
22:28 < Stitch626> btw, i've tried to use ipv6 in teeworlds, and i was unable to connect (even if the host had just ipv6 and no ipv4)
22:28 <@minus> we had that years ago but it causes trouble with clients that do have an ipv6 stack but no connectivity
22:29 < Stitch626> are there any problems so use ipv6 if the ip is known? because that connection issue
22:29 <@minus> no idea what you're saying
22:29 <@minus> the ipv6 situation with teeworlds has been on my todo list for at least 4 years
22:30 < Stitch626> can u tell me how is the support status of tw?
22:30 < daey> is the transition so much work? i thought the network layer is well abstracted and can be swapped rather quickly
22:30 < Stitch626> of ipv6 stuff only
22:30 <@minus> direct connectivity with ipv6 should work
22:31 <@minus> dunno about dual-stack support
22:31 <@minus> daey: dual-stack support is the hard part
22:31 < Stitch626> but direct connection didnt worked, even with or without dualstack (i had ipv4 disabled to test it)
22:31 < daey> y didnt think of that
22:32 < Stitch626> 0.7 was also unable to connect
22:32 <@minus> Stitch626: most likely it's you doing something wrong then, pretty sure it works
22:32 < Stitch626> ping worked, and onnecting to a httpd server also
22:32 <@minus> hm
22:33 < Stitch626> we tried windows AND linux as host, both didnt worked
22:33 < Henningstone> on LAN it works, so there must at least be *something* working
22:33 < Stitch626> if the client disconnected (aborted to connect) i could see a message
22:33 < Stitch626> ye
22:37 <@minus> Stitch626: connect to ipv6.mnus.de
22:37 < Stitch626> mom
22:38 <@minus> [5828dd53][server]: client dropped. cid=1 addr=[2a00:...]:5340 reason='Timeout'
22:38 <@minus> your shit's fucked
22:39 < Henningstone> that was me aborting the connection attempt, apparently
22:39 < Stitch626> i try to connect atm
22:39 < Stitch626> and reconnected
22:39 < Stitch626> lets see if i can get a ban
22:39 < Henningstone> sure you can xD
22:40 < Stitch626> result minus ?
22:40 <@minus> that timeout thing happened a couple of times
22:40 < Henningstone> but I got another idea... let's try connection with native ipv6 only
22:40 <@minus> no other ip attempted to connect
22:40 < Stitch626> hmm
22:40 <@minus> fwiw i'm connecting to it via VPN as i have no native IPv6
22:40 < rand> minus: is this a 0.7 server ?
22:41 <@minus> no
22:41 <@minus> 0.6.4
22:41 < Stitch626> i try to connect atm..
22:41 < Stitch626> ah
22:41 < Stitch626> client have some probs, nice
22:41 < rand> seems fine
22:42 < Henningstone> you can connect?
22:42 < EastByte> I want ipv6 :(
22:42 < rand> my bot can at least (i don't have vpn or ipv4 from my isp)
22:42 < rand> so do I
22:43 < Henningstone> I'm on native ipv6 without any dual stack or even ipv4... still won't do it D:
22:43 < Stitch626> connection try from me (another pc)
22:43 < EastByte> shit's fucked then
22:43 < Stitch626> did u see anything?
22:43 < daey> how do i check if i got an ipv6 address? would 'ip addr show' show it?
22:44 < EastByte> daey: yes
22:44 < rand> i didn't
22:44 < daey> hm i assumed that ovhs servers would be on ipv6. i guess they arent
22:44 < EastByte> ovh has ipv6 support
22:46 < Stitch626> daey ifconfig shows IPv6 addresses
22:47 < daey> http://lpaste.net/339065
22:47 < daey> does that mean i have one?
22:47 < daey> in that case my provider already supports  v6 which i kinda doubt :P
22:48 < EastByte> no, these are local addresses
22:49 < Stitch626> what about "scope: global" ?
22:49 < Stitch626> hm
22:49 < daey> yes. but that would mean my router is giving me an ipv6 (even if its only local)
22:52 < daey> hm i can ping them locally. i had no idea :P
22:54 < Henningstone> pinging the ipv6.mnus.de works fine though. I just can't connect
22:54 <@minus> nc ipv6.mnus.de 2000
22:55 < Henningstone> gives nothing at all
22:55 < EastByte> pinging from ovh also works fine (packets appear to be routed over USA, though)
22:55 < EastByte> typical
22:55 <@minus> heh
22:56 <@minus> hm, connection refused
22:56 < EastByte> hm, connection refused
22:56 <@minus> ah, forgot a -6 with netcat
22:57 <@minus> that did work
23:34 < NanoSlime_> mfff
