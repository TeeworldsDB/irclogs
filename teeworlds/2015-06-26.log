16:32 < DoNe> hi, is there any way to escape quotation marks in the server console to print: "a"b
16:32 < DoNe> because echo "a"b outputs a
16:34 <@minus> maybe \
16:43 < DoNe> ah i already tried / it doesnt work
16:43 < EastByte> it's \"
16:44 < EastByte> echo \"a\"b
16:44 < DoNe> but it echos the \ too
16:44 < EastByte> interesting
16:44 < DoNe> yes XD
16:44 < EastByte> ah, do echo "\"a\"b"
16:44 < EastByte>  \" works only inside of " "
16:45 < DoNe> ah this works thanks
16:52 < nheir> hm, is it possible to use “\n” in sv_motd ?
