11:55 < JulianAssange> Can somebody check if 'Australian Race/Run Server' is registered on tw?
12:43 < JulianAssange> http://storage2.static.itmages.ru/i/12/0816/h_1345066091_9631390_8b03f7740d.png lmao
17:16 < EastByte> JulianAssange: I can't find it
17:52 < JulianAssange> ugh
17:52 < JulianAssange> oh
17:52 < JulianAssange> teerace is old
17:53 < JulianAssange> Is teerace project dad? no commits since 2012
17:55 < JulianAssange> ah yes
17:57 < EastByte> teerace was pretty finished
17:57 < EastByte> is the website down?
17:59 < JulianAssange> the repo is outdated by 3 years: https://github.com/SushiTee/teeworlds/tree/teerace
17:59 < EastByte> yea so?
18:00 < heinrich5991> a finished project :)
18:00 < heinrich5991> might still need some security updates
18:01 < EastByte> indeed
18:02 < JulianAssange> a finished project, as in, no more development on it?
18:02 < JulianAssange> it needs to be updated to 0.6.3 for the header file, atleast
18:03 < EastByte> http://race.teesites.net/
18:03 < EastByte> yep website is offline
18:04 < heinrich5991> EastByte: do you know for how long?
18:05 < EastByte> nope, we would need to get in contact with sushitee
18:05 < JulianAssange> Author: SushiTee <weichel.sascha@xxx.xx>
18:05 < EastByte> awesome guy :)
18:06 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: is that the actual or have you removed the domain?
18:07 < JulianAssange> oh
18:07 < JulianAssange> that's from git log
18:10 < JulianAssange> EastByte: try finding the server now
18:11 < JulianAssange> nothing from my end.. I can see the server in 'local', though
18:11 < JulianAssange> and no errors from masterserver reporting
18:14 < JulianAssange> any ideas heinrich5991 ?
18:15 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: ideas about what?
18:15 < JulianAssange> my server cannot be found on 'Iternet' tab in teeworlds, but no reports of error regading master server
18:16 < EastByte> maybe I cannot even connect to the ip
18:16 < EastByte> hosting from home network?
18:16 < JulianAssange> 58.160.108.246:8303
18:16 < JulianAssange> yes
18:16 < JulianAssange> wait wtf
18:16 < EastByte> doesnt work
18:17 < JulianAssange> try now
18:18 < EastByte> wrong version
18:18 < EastByte> nethash is invalid
18:18 < EastByte> but I can find the server now
18:19 < JulianAssange> ok fixed
18:19 < JulianAssange> it said "no firewall/nat problems detected", but in reality, it wasn't portforwarded at all
18:20 < JulianAssange> maybe my router responds to connections on unforwarded ports
18:20 < EastByte> btw. it would be better to use the ddnet modification for race maps
18:22 < JulianAssange> probably
18:22 < JulianAssange> oh yes, it would be
18:22 < JulianAssange> because of those vulns
18:22 < EastByte> awesome prediction extensins client+serverside
18:22 < JulianAssange> ugh
18:22 < EastByte> extensions*
18:24 <@matricks> prediction extensions?
18:25 < EastByte> grenade prediction for example, which required a client+server modification
18:26 <@matricks> what more is predicted?
18:27 < JulianAssange> where the grenade will be when u jump on it :)
18:27 < EastByte> I think the impact from explosion of grenade to the player
18:27 < JulianAssange> and IF the prediction is right, where your tee will move because of it
18:27 <@matricks> ahh
18:29 < EastByte> I think before the projectile direction vector wasn't accurate enough for such a prediction
18:29 <@matricks> that is kinda neat
18:29 <@matricks> but that should be a client change only right?
18:30 < JulianAssange> ^ that's what i thought
18:30 < JulianAssange> didn't realize it was serversided too
18:30 < EastByte> see my previous message
18:30 <@matricks> oh.. the server might use a non-clamped version.. yeah.
18:30 < EastByte> indeed :)
18:31 <@matricks> I need to do some food
21:51 < jxsl13_> ._. 
21:51 < botnik> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=._.
21:52 < jxsl13_> has anyone ever set up an uptee server ..?
21:59 < heinrich5991> yes, there were a few uptee servers running sometime
21:59 < heinrich5991> uhm
21:59 < heinrich5991> you mean the uptee master
21:59 < heinrich5991> sushitee has
21:59 < heinrich5991> there's an instance on teesites.net
22:00 < jxsl13_> I mean I want to set up such an webinterface as the teesites one
22:00 < jxsl13_> sadly, I'm kind of failing
22:04 < jxsl13_> was wondering if someone could help me :/
22:12 < heinrich5991> jxsl13_: is there a specific error that is stopping you?
22:13 < jxsl13_> I kind of don t get it to work, either my nginx config is bad or simply false or whatever else :/
22:13 < jxsl13_> my linux knowledge is also quite small
22:14 < heinrich5991> jxsl13_: what goes wrong?
22:14 < heinrich5991> i.e. what doesn't work?
22:14 < jxsl13_> the website isnt showing
22:16 < jxsl13_> it seems like maybe the nginx config doesnt work or I simply didnt put it in the website folder of nginx, but I wonder which file I should use a sthe index file, becaus ethe are no html, nor other typical website files in the uptee folder from sushitee
22:16 < Muttley__> jxsl13_, nginx with php-fpm ? or just plain html ?
22:16 < jxsl13_> don t know ...
22:17 < jxsl13_> here are only python files in the uptee website folder
22:17 < jxsl13_> it seems
22:18 < heinrich5991> jxsl13_: how did you connect nginx with the python stuff?
22:18 < Muttley__> ah uptee, did you follow the manual ?
22:19 < jxsl13_> ._. didnt do anything, just installes nginx and well, just followed the manual
22:19 < botnik> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=._.
22:19 < jxsl13_> installd*
22:19 < jxsl13_> ed*
22:20 < heinrich5991> jxsl13_: can you point me to the manual?
22:20 < Muttley__> dumb question but did you restart nginx after the configuration changes ?
22:20 < Muttley__> https://github.com/upTee/upTee/blob/master/docs/production_server.md
22:20 < jxsl13_> https://github.com/upTee/upTee/blob/master/docs/production_server.md
22:20 < jxsl13_> yeah thah s it
22:20 < jxsl13_> that
22:20 < Muttley__> did you restart nginx ?
22:20 < jxsl13_> yes
22:21 < Muttley__> with the initd script or with service restart nginx ?
22:21 < jxsl13_> I restarted the whole server
22:21 < Muttley__> ok that should also do the trick xD
22:21 < jxsl13_> maybe I should retry it with a nonroot user
22:22 < Muttley__> do you get a error if you go to the page ? or does it simply do nothing
22:23 < jxsl13_> nothing
22:23 < jxsl13_> af if there is no page there
22:23 < jxsl13_> as 
22:23 < Muttley__> hmm ok
22:23 < jxsl13_> more or less like ther eis nothing in the nginx website folder
22:23 < Muttley__>   server_name example.org www.example.org; # your domain here!
22:23 < jxsl13_> maybe help setup a new one on a non-root user
22:23 < jxsl13_> uptee.de
22:23 < Muttley__> did you change that to your domainname ?
22:24 < jxsl13_> how to change the webfolder of nginx?
22:24 < Muttley__> i cannot make a connection with that server... nginx isnt running or there is a firewall
22:25 < Muttley__> can you pastebin the contents of /var/log/nginx/error.log
22:26 < jxsl13_> hm k
22:29 < jxsl13_> http://pastebin.com/BEvR2YTn
22:36 < jxsl13_> now nginx runs
22:36 < jxsl13_> but has got a 404 error
22:37 < jxsl13_> how to set /root/uptee/web/ tonginx main directory?
22:38 < JulianAssange> ._.
22:38 < botnik> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=._.
22:38 < JulianAssange> what
22:41 < jxsl13_> botnik
22:42 < JulianAssange> ye but
22:42 < JulianAssange> what is it lol
