17:47 < heinrich5991> in teeworlds source code `i = i^(i>>31); // if(i<0) i = ~i`
17:47 <@matricks> :)
17:47 < heinrich5991> but
17:47 < heinrich5991> if I give
17:47 < heinrich5991> `if(i<0) i = ~i;`
17:47 < heinrich5991> guess what gcc generates :)
17:47 <@matricks> same? :)
17:47 < heinrich5991> yes
17:48 < heinrich5991> on -O2, that is
17:48 <@matricks> :)
17:48 < heinrich5991> does that mean one could remove it as premature optimization?
17:48 <@matricks> no
17:48 <@matricks> typical thing you shouldn't trust that the compiler will do for you
17:48 <@matricks> gcc in your case did, others might not
17:49 < heinrich5991> I checked clang as well
17:49 < heinrich5991> I also believe that i>>something is UB in C
17:49 < heinrich5991> for i not unsigned
17:49 <@matricks> really?
17:50 <@matricks> well, might be up to the arch..
17:50 < heinrich5991> ah wait, it might be that i<<something is UB
17:53 < heinrich5991> mh. why shouldn't you trust compilers?
17:53 < heinrich5991> isn't the general sentiment like - don't tryt o optimize yourself, the compiler is smarter anyway?
17:54 <@matricks> heh, I've fought with compilers so many times for them to generate the more optimal code that I want...
17:55 <@matricks> pipelining etc they can do on their own... usually
17:55 <@matricks> heinrich5991: it basiclly depends on how smart you are :)
17:56 < heinrich5991> heh, or how smart you consider yourself ;)
17:56 <@matricks> yeah
17:56 <@matricks> the compilers today are pretty smart.. but can be very stupid at times
17:57 < heinrich5991> do you have an example?
17:58 <@matricks> not straight of the bat
17:58 <@matricks> usually stuff I fiddle with at work
17:59 < heinrich5991> mh.
17:59 < heinrich5991> you look at the assembly output?
18:00 <@matricks> yup
18:00 <@matricks> + performance measurements etc etc
18:00 <@matricks> you kinda need to read asm to find compiler bugs as well
18:01 < heinrich5991> you found compiler bugs?
18:01 <@matricks> yeah
18:01 <@matricks> serveral times
18:01 < heinrich5991> all compiler bugs I found so far turned out to be logic errors in my code
20:46 < alebrije> hi all
20:47 < alebrije> im on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) and im using the free, open source driver for my ATI RadeonHD 4770
20:48 < alebrije> but have this problem too: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10839
20:49 < alebrije> I can't undestand why teeworlds lag, and others games (FPS) like Sauerbraten, warsow or World os Padman run very well (without lag) and theay are more 'complex' than Teeworlds
20:51 <@matricks> is it lag or bad fps?
20:51 < alebrije> When i have Ubuntu 12.04 and the propietary driver (Catalyst) dont have this problem
20:51 <@matricks> perhaps some sort of interference with the compositor
20:54 <@matricks> alebrije: press ctrl+shift+d .. in the top left corner there is a thing saying "pred: X ms"
20:54 < alebrije> let me see...
20:56 <@matricks> you could press ctrl+shift+d, ctrl+shift+g, and then take a screenshot for us, that should show enough information
20:56 <@matricks> (while connected to a server
20:57 < alebrije> ok
21:11 < alebrije> matricks: http://i.imgur.com/TKuH6xb.png (1st screenshot)
21:11 <@matricks> no ctrl+shift+g
21:12 <@matricks> missing that one
21:12 <@matricks> missing that info
21:12 < Learath2> alebrije: did you try it on a vanilla server ?
21:12 < Learath2> no idea how that jetpack gun behaves
21:13 <@matricks> no prediction on that one I guess, that is going to suck
21:13 < alebrije> hmm, did you need some screenshot from a vanilla server, ctf, dm?
21:13 <@matricks> take a vanilla server
21:13 <@matricks> press ctrl+shift+d
21:14 <@matricks> press ctrl+shift+g
21:14 < heinrich5991> yes
21:14 < heinrich5991> it's not predicted
21:14 <@matricks> both of those combos, and then take a screenshot
21:14 < heinrich5991> the ddracemax guys added some kind of jetpack gun
21:14 < alebrije> http://i.imgur.com/99uAEDC.png (2nd screenshot)
21:14 < alebrije> and 3rd http://i.imgur.com/94Rd40o.png
21:14 < alebrije> i'll try from vanilla server
21:15 <@matricks> 30 fps :/
21:15 < Learath2> heinrich5991: the ddmax guys are ruining ittt
21:16 <@matricks> could try turning off threading
21:16 <@matricks> gfx_threaded 0
21:16 <@matricks> or whats it called
21:16 <@matricks> or is that turned off by default?
21:19  * matricks goes and watches a movie
21:24 < alebrije> anothers screenshot from ddnet vanilla server USA
21:25 < alebrije> 1st http://i.imgur.com/eUzPUrB.png
21:25 < alebrije> and 2nd  http://i.imgur.com/dz3UVcw.png
21:27 < alebrije> i'll try with gfx_threaded = 0
21:33  * minus is watching too
21:33 <@minus> actually been watching all day
21:33 <@minus> procrastinating like a pro
21:42 < alebrije> matricks: I have noticed that when messages are received from the server have that lag jumps. Like 'some has joined' or sometimes when someone chat, :'(
21:43 < alebrije> That not happened with ubuntu 12.04 and privative driver, :(
21:45 < noother> heinrich5991: that jetpack gun is done by ddnet, not ddmax
21:45 < heinrich5991> noother: ah right ddnet
22:55 <@matricks> alebrije: sound like font texture recreation or something weird
23:02 < alebrije> ;'(, what can i do?
23:02 <@matricks> no idea, have to debug it on the computer to figure it out
23:02 <@matricks> try turning vsync off
23:03 < alebrije> its off
23:03 <@matricks> still solid 30?
23:05 < BotoX> buttersmooth 96fps with v-sync here on radeon
23:09 < alebrije> BotoX: are you using catalyst or free driver (radeon)
23:09 < BotoX> radeon
23:09 < BotoX> With a HD5870
23:09 < BotoX> gfx_asyncrender 1
23:09 < BotoX> gfx_threaded 1
23:09 < alebrije> why i cant get more than 60 fps, and vsync is off
23:10 <@matricks> alebrije: you get 60fps constant with vsync off?
23:10 < alebrije> yep
23:10 <@matricks> then there is some weird driver/compositor stuff going on
23:11 < alebrije> :(
23:11 <@matricks> dunno what
23:11 < alebrije> on all my games (with vsync off), no more than 60 fps
23:11 < alebrije> its wired
23:12 < BotoX> check driconf
23:12 < alebrije> how?
23:12 < alebrije> xD
23:12 < BotoX> `driconf`
23:13 < alebrije> i dont have it, installing...
23:14 < alebrije> >.<
23:14 < BotoX> good night everyone :v
23:58 < alebrije> matricks: i got this on my ~/.drirc file config
23:58 < alebrije> <driconf>
23:58 < alebrije>     <device screen="0" driver="r600">
23:58 < alebrije>         <application name="Default">
23:58 < alebrije>             <option name="force_s3tc_enable" value="false" />
23:58 < alebrije>             <option name="pp_celshade" value="0" />
23:59 < alebrije> but my card is RadeonHD 4770 (RV740 not r600) so... i must change this?
