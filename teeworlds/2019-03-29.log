16:59 < TeeSlayer> Dune: LUM | Level has bots?
16:59 < TeeSlayer> I haven't seen any so far :o
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> as far as I can tell, TeeSlayer, yes
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there were 4 bots with the exact same name
17:00 < TeeSlayer> I think somebody just joined multiple times to level up his accounts
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It didn't look that way
17:01 < TeeSlayer> Dune: I just asked the dev
17:01 < TeeSlayer> he said no
17:02 < TeeSlayer> it was just a player
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> alright, well, can't tell the difference so I'll redact unless I find something that shows otherwise
17:10 < TeeSlayer> I think it's hard for a hoster to moderate user-created bots^^
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah, they are not expected to
18:27 < rand> I saw this bot
18:28 < rand> spamming fire without moving (except for hammer)
18:28 < rand> there was one real player that was actually playing with laser
18:29 <@Dune> rand: there were 4 bots when I checked
18:30 < rand> dunno, he may control one tee whenever he wants among the bot, or was connect with 3 bots and on usual client
18:30 < rand> or anything else ^^
19:33 <@Dune> heinrich5991: getting the payloads but still need to set up the secret :)
