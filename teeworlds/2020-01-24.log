00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think only the file format changed, not the basic logic?
00:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ips are considered personal information
00:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> player names, inputs etc are not
13:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> unlike demos it doesn't store votes and chat
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> demos store who voted what?
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> surely not, even server side
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so it's anonymized
14:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no, only totals in demos
21:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> bois im back! So in case anyone knows how the automapper works please let me know 🙂
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i know it
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> do you know about this?
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/670362362737590302/unknown.png
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12648
21:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i would make two completly different rulesets for vertical and horizontal
21:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> like grass_main has "grass" and "cave"
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> there is a basetile in the mapping rules
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so you can only use 1 tile and the rest shouldn't change
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes i made two rules
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> like this
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/670364110537359370/unknown.png
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> does it work well?
21:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (*pshhh* read that 9 year old tutorial, that I wrote *pssh end*)
21:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *pssh* didn't know there was an update for 0.7 *pssh end*
21:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> why is there a basetile if it's ignored?
21:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the automapper changes all tiles which are not 0
21:35 < Dune> you can grep in the code where basetile is used
21:35 < Dune> that's what I'd do
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/68e4a1784bd4f7021634f0cf4198f6e14b711495/src/game/editor/auto_map.cpp#L132
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> aw, man, Dune, you didn't give them the random skeleton :'/ no tutorial without a happy end 😄
21:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hm?
21:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Btw there is no tutorial for the doodads automapper
21:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the tutorial is incomplete and lacks a part
21:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=8886 <-- there is a highlight at the and of the tutorial 😄
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> okay, well I rewrote it
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> give people their 0.7 highlight 😮
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> x)
21:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I would write a part, but nobody except me and Chillerdragon seems to be interested in this feature anyway
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is there any conversation/interest/whtever going on about killing servers gracefully via ctrl-c/SIGINT?
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> when i do this in windows, the server doesn't close but stops working
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> it happened to me often when copying the rcon
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there is no graceful shutdown yet Oo
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does the server freeze or what do you mean?
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or the classical disconnect, cuz the server was just killed
21:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> contrary to a proper shutdown, where people get disconnected when the server shuts down
21:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> server freeze
21:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> .exe is running but connections get a timeout
21:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I dunno, if windows has the same signaling as linux
21:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no, it doesn't have the same, they're doing their own stuff
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> how would one force close a shell program there?
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> pressing X in the ui
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no, I mean it has different handling there
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there's also ctrl-break
21:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> why the heck woud it freeze the execution Oo
21:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe it's meant literally
21:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> like interrupting the execution
21:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> "interrupt"
21:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/handlerroutine
21:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm
21:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> looks like it should terminate the process normally
21:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think the server side would benefit from a graceful handling of that shutdown, as nobody actually want to start the tw client in order to shutdown their server and then go back to their terminal to restart it
21:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> wants*
21:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i would like an autocopy rcon to clipboard when starting server
21:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> but yes, i see all the problems too
21:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no comprendo ._.
21:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> create a autoexec.cfg setting an rcon password in your config directory
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Assa
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes that's what I am doing
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> but i would ceranly prefer if you could "compile" an autoexec for you
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> like `bam conf=debug autoexec`
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what do you mean?
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 I also like the graceful shutdown thing
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> template autoexec.cfg generator?
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you always have to write an autoexec manually after compiling a fresh server or something
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @jxsl13 exactly
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> why? put it into your config directory
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> then you don't have to write it every time
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> this works 😮
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> all file access in teeworlds works like this
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ah, well, one can have an autoexec.cfg in their directory, nothing of the build process touches that
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> my servers run in tmux sessions x) so I'd appreciate the graceful shutdown :o, but I already have it, but it kind of sucks currently 😄
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ah, I see the problem there, @heinrich5991
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the cmake build does not copy the storage.cfg into your build folder
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if I remember correctly
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> even if, so what?
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> so the server executable should not know where the config directory lies?
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there's a default
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ah, ok
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ~/.config/teeworlds ?
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or something like that?
22:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ~/.local/share/
22:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> teeworlds/
22:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Assa the automapper.json http://zillyhuhn.com:8080/5s
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> zillyhuhn
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye bought it yesterday xd
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> oh jesus 😄 they are getting more awesome evry time
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no more ip pastes
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> if none of the rules apply, the basetile is set to 21 @ChillerDragon
22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is there no chillerdragon.de/.com?
22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and i see that you did that for both horizontal and vertical
22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> zillyhuhn > chillerdragon
22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nice, discord is dead

22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I wrote: tru
22:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @ChillerDragon horizontal vertical: basetile should be 38 instead of 21
22:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> change that and automapper should work
22:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> k ima test thanks for looking into it
22:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> `double horizontal`
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hmm not really but it got better i guess now i can switch between horizontal and vertical a few times and then squares look fine
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/670374813004726302/unknown.png

22:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i mean using 38 is a good idea and im sure i can play around with that but can someone tell me why same shapes give different results o.O
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea well i think its a rotation thing..
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm anways is someone motivated to rewrite automapper and do some more advanced rules that add a option to provide a index next to "full" and "empty" the index is the index which got set by the previous rule so the automapper needs as many iterations as there are rules
22:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2174
22:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah okay i now get it. Using rotate is bad automap style this causes such bugs. rather ruse the index of the rotatet tile in the tileset.
22:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> thanks a lot @Assa i would have never understood automapper without u ❤️
22:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I wrote a mapgenerator
22:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> took me a few days to get this stuff right
22:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh thats cool i always wanted to write a mapgenerator but i am too noob
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> It was really hard and i needed to add sdl to the server side in order to generate them on the fly
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> if you want to take a look: https://github.com/AssassinTee/MultiMap/tree/dev
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sdl serverside xd
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sounds like something i would do
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> MultiMap i see u go with the hype 😄
22:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> no, I did the hype
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> o.O
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> TPaul is it u?
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol sdl serverside. why is that needed to generate it on the fly ._.
23:03 < Dune> it's not?
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> when you do stack programming
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you can get an awful lot of dependencies
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you don't care what the editor you use does and why it needs sdl as long as it does what you want
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> that project just proved that it's possible, not that it can be done a better way
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what is that editor called :D
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ok guys am i getting crazy or is vflip and hflip flipped?
23:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/670400704992641044/unknown.png

23:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how can it get index 157 and hflip?
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Assa send brain pls
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i know a place where you can get mouse brain parts
