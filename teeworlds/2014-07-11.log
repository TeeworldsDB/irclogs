00:00 <@matricks> hope it isn't used for something important :D
00:01 <@matricks> ish.. yip. that should be removed...
00:02 <@matricks> old bad code by me >.<
00:03 < Learath2> you should come back and fixit :D
00:03 <@matricks> hehe
00:03 <@matricks> dealing with time and floats == huge no-no
00:04 < Learath2> why ?
00:05 <@matricks> depends on the case, but it looses precision
00:06 < Learath2> so no floats ?
00:06 <@matricks> no absolute floats :)
00:06 <@matricks> like local time
00:07 < Learath2> what should it be instead ?
00:07 < Learath2> ints ?
00:07 <@matricks> depends
00:13 <@matricks> Learath2: at around 131k seconds.. that localtime is going to start to have problems
00:14 <@matricks> sooo.. don't be connected more then 36 hours
00:14 < Learath2> :D
00:15 <@matricks> I've actually seen this i quake3 :)
00:15 <@matricks> don't leave a quake3 server online on the same map for too long :)
00:15 < Learath2> couldnt it be solved with a carry ?
00:15 <@matricks> ?
00:15 < Madara> Well, what happens when this kind of bug happens?
00:16 < Madara> And another question, related to my lame C++Skills!
00:16 < Learath2> when timer maxes out just add one to another int and restart the time ?
00:16 < Madara> How to add a string with a char array?
00:17 < Learath2> a string with a char array ?
00:17 < Madara> y
00:18 < Madara> Or something like this:
00:18 <@matricks> Learath2: ... so.. increase the precision more or less :D
00:18 < Madara> char array[5];
00:18 <@matricks> the timer won't wrap at 131k, it will just start to behave funny
00:18 < Madara> "Blah: " + array;
00:18 < Learath2> huh why does that actually happen ?
00:19 <@matricks> because thats how floating point works :)
00:19 <@matricks> it can't represent all numbers between 1 and 0 and 239047820389 and 0
00:19 <@matricks> the precision shifts, the larger numbers you have, the larger the smallest change will be
00:20 < Learath2> Madara: str_append from base/system.h should be helpful
00:21 < Learath2> huh i guess i knew nothing about how floating points worked
00:22 <@matricks> I mean, they are 32bit and can represent numbers from 1.1755e-38 3.4028234e38
00:23 <@matricks> insert a too there
00:24 <@matricks> they represent the numbers as (-1)^s * 2^e * m
00:24 <@matricks> where s is the sign bit, e is the exponent and m is the mantissa
00:24 < Learath2> oh its that simple ?
00:24 < Learath2> so the bigger the mantissa gets the less place there is for the exponent 
00:24 <@matricks> no, they are fixed number of bits
00:25 < Learath2> meh
00:25 < Learath2> i tried :D
00:25 <@matricks> for single precision, 1 bit sign, 8 bit exponent and 23 bit fraction/mantissa
00:25 <@matricks> think of it like this
00:25 <@matricks> you can have 123456 or 12345.6 or 1234.56 or 123.456 etc.. but you can't have 123456.7
00:26 <@matricks> floating point :)
00:26 <@matricks> you can have 6 numbers, and then the exponent sets where the comma should be
00:27 <@matricks> which means.. at 123.456 seconds.. you still have millisecond precision
00:27 <@matricks> but at 1234.56 seconds.. you only have increments of 10ms
00:28 < Learath2> oh
00:28 <@matricks> and at 12345.6.. well.. 100ms which is above the 16ms that is a 60hz frame
00:28 <@matricks> and funny stuff starts to happen
00:28 < Learath2> projectiles should be weird
00:29 <@matricks> don't think so
00:29 <@matricks> *digs into the code*
00:30 <@matricks> >.< all these static variables
00:30 <@matricks> yuck
01:04 < Madara> Bye!
01:04 < Madara> Have done what I wanted to do for.. well yesterday...
01:04 < Madara> Tomorrow i have school and only 5 hours of sleep... Bye!
09:32 < DJ_MuTeD> hi
09:33 <@matricks> HAI!
09:33 <@minus> OHAI!
09:34 <@matricks> so much HAI
09:34 <@matricks> and I'm not seeing any topics :/
09:34 <@matricks> any topic..
09:34 <@minus> me neither
09:35 < PsychoGod> i could ask some questions, but i don't have it yet xD
09:36 < PsychoGod> and OLAHAI, it's mucher HAI than muchest one
09:41 <@minus> wörk wörk
09:41 <@matricks> wow, such work
09:42 <@matricks> minus: I'm getting more and more cozy with rust as well :)
09:43 <@minus> nice
09:43 < DJ_MuTeD> wow
09:44 < DJ_MuTeD> I'd like to create a Teeworlds mod, but I only code in c#
09:44 <@matricks> then you better learn c++
09:44 < DJ_MuTeD> It might be possible to embed native dlls, but it will take time
09:44 < DJ_MuTeD> I don't like c++
09:45 <@minus> better learn C++
09:45 < DJ_MuTeD> :<
09:45 <@minus> you're not gonna get far with embedding DLLs
09:45 <@matricks> and games doesn't like c# so
09:45 < DJ_MuTeD> There is SDL for c#
09:45 <@minus> if you want to access teeworlds stuff you still need to write the bindings
09:45 <@matricks> DJ_MuTeD: doesn't mean games like c$ :)
09:45 < DJ_MuTeD> Yeah
09:45 <@matricks> c# :/
09:45 <@minus> just because it exists, doesn't mean it's good
09:45 <@matricks> and SDL isn't just for games
09:45 <@minus> C# is nice for doing GUI apps on windows
09:46 <@minus> other than that C# is a horrible, platform-bound language
09:46 < DJ_MuTeD> mono
09:46 <@minus> no.
09:47 < DJ_MuTeD> I actually use Linux all the time and mono runs really well
09:47 <@matricks> doesn't matter, c# isn't really fit for games in my oppinion
09:47 <@matricks> it doesn't have the characteristics needed
09:48 <@matricks> and it doesnt' matter, teeworlds is c++ :)
09:48 < DJ_MuTeD> I am aware of that
09:48 <@minus> adding a bit of lua to the mix wouldn't be too bad though
09:49 <@matricks> minus: I agree, but I've always wanted a scripting language without a GC :)
09:49 <@matricks> minus: with some deterministic performance
09:49 <@minus> write one
09:49 < DJ_MuTeD> lol
09:49 <@minus> do it
09:49 <@matricks> ... I think pawn actually is btw
09:49 <@matricks> minus: been there, done that :D
09:49 <@minus> k
09:50 <@matricks> minus: I did a small language suitable for sending the code from server to client :)
09:50 <@matricks> for rendering purposes
09:50 <@matricks> wham! he was fun
09:51 <@minus> sounds like something useful for subtitle rendering
09:51 <@minus> ASS so bad
09:52  * bt slaps laxa around a bit with a large fishbot
09:52 <@matricks> pawn is a deterministic language: it will run at the same speed every launch —there is no garbage collector that kicks in. The compiler can estimate the memory footprint for the script (unless the script contains a recursive procedure), and that memory footprint is fixed and stable as well.
09:52 <@matricks> I would consider that for games
09:53 <@matricks> it's being used in source apparently
09:56 <@minus> interesting
10:20 < DJ_MuTeD> Quakenet banned me because of using a tor node ;_;
10:20 < PsychoGod> -.-
10:20 < PsychoGod> ._.
10:20 < botnik> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=._.
10:21 < DJ_MuTeD> Is lua in teeworlds any good for modding?
10:23 <@matricks> DJ_MuTeD: we have talked about it, but I would prefer something like pawn
10:23 < DJ_MuTeD> so there are no other options than c++ or lua at the moment?
10:24 < PsychoGod> yeah, and Python <3
10:25 <@matricks> DJ_MuTeD: there is no lua-mod support
10:25 <@matricks> only way todo a mod is in c++
10:25 < DJ_MuTeD> https://github.com/MAP94/teeworlds/blob/master/lua-documentation.lua
10:25 < PsychoGod> that's not standart client
10:25 < PsychoGod> and server, so
10:25 < DJ_MuTeD> doesn't matter
10:26 < PsychoGod> C++ is enough to mod
10:26 < DJ_MuTeD> I don't know c++
10:27 < DJ_MuTeD> so lua is the only option for me i guess
10:27 < PsychoGod> you know C#, it's the start to mod on C++
10:27 <@matricks> if you wanna start learning coding games, you better start learning a language that is suited for it
10:29 < DJ_MuTeD> I think it will be easier to create own teeworlds-like in c# for me lol
10:29 <@matricks> ...
10:30 < DJ_MuTeD> because I want to mod it heavily 
10:30 <@minus> matricks: let the children play
10:30 < PsychoGod> loled 2
10:30 <@matricks> minus: I guess
10:30  * matricks goes back to work
10:31 < PsychoGod> ah, it was fun
10:31  * PsychoGod goes back to watch Advanture Time :D
10:51 <@minus> TIL make -j is not a good idea
10:51 <@minus> the 16GB RAM in this machine were full immediately
10:51 <@minus> -j9 is better.
11:21 <@matricks> :D
11:23 <@minus> didn't know -j spawned as much as possible in parallel
11:23 <@minus> i thought it uses the optimum
11:31 <@matricks> bam does the same thing
11:33 <@minus> iirc bam doesn't accept -j without parameter
11:34 <@matricks> no, it does awesome automaticly
11:37 <@minus> what?
11:38 <@matricks> bam automaticly does n-core parralization without command lines options
11:38 <@minus> i don't think so
11:38 <@minus> not the version i last used
11:38 <@matricks> then you have an old version my friend
11:39 <@minus> well, not gonna try now
11:39 <@minus> gotta code the pythons
12:10 <@matricks> minus: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/324283889/potato-salad
12:15 < PsychoGod> omg
12:15 < PsychoGod> 46 k $ on a salad XD
12:17 < PsychoGod> http://www.cnet.com/news/guys-kickstarter-dream-making-potato-salad-possibly-with-dill/
13:11 <@minus> yeah, saw it when it was at ~$2000
17:51 < Madara> If a player fires, CNetObj_Playerinfo .m_Fire will be 1?
17:53 <@minus> set breakpoint, fire, look at backtrace
17:56 < heinrich5991> Madara: it will be increased by one IIRC
17:56 < heinrich5991> minus: or simply read the code
18:19 < DoNe> hi
18:20 < Madara> hey!
18:21 < DoNe> welcome
18:21 < Madara> hi!
18:21 < DoNe> @minus i have a question
18:21 < Madara> hi!
18:21 < Madara> tfu
18:21 < Madara> sry for the spam
18:22 <@minus> yes?
18:22 < DoNe> can u look up the reason why some1 is banned from the master servers?
18:22 < DoNe> and ofcourse if some1 is banned?
18:23 < DoNe> i think my vserver is banned from the masterservers
18:23 < DoNe> my servers cant register anymore
18:23 < DoNe> since about 1 wekk
18:24 < DoNe> week*
18:24 <@minus> haven't banned anyone on months
18:24 < DoNe> oh u only ban manually
18:25 < DoNe> thank you bb
18:28 < DoNe> forgot something: do teeworlds servers download the banlist of the masterserver and ban these client too?
18:29 < heinrich5991> no, not yet
18:29 < heinrich5991> there is an issue for something similar though
18:30 < heinrich5991> opt-out global bans
18:30 < heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1136
18:37 < DoNe> i despair since a week because my teeworldsservers cant register to the masterservers anymore. this only affects my vserver and i cant figure out if the problem is on my side or where it comes from.
18:38 < heinrich5991> DoNe: could you give us your IP?
18:38 < DoNe> 84.38.65.222
18:39 <@minus> not banned
18:42 < DoNe> thanks, so i'll continue searching this damn problem
18:43 <@minus> welp
19:30 < Madara> AAAH
19:31 < Madara> How to get my own team in the teeworlds client src?
19:31 < PsychoGod> long time no see )
19:31 < Madara> xD
19:32 < Madara> 	if(pPlayerInfo.m_Local){Team = pPlayerInfo.m_Team;}
19:32 < Madara> is this possible?
20:03 < Madara> Client IDs are from 0-15?
20:03 < heinrich5991> yes
22:30 < heinrich5991> matricks: do you happen to know whether there are other languages similar to pawn?
23:26 <@matricks> heinrich5991: no
