07:51 <@matricks> haha,, all the kirby talk :D
07:52 <@matricks> the actual tee was designed like a year before kirby was released actually
07:52 <@matricks> in the beginning of the 90
09:52 < EastByte> matricks: cool fact
10:00 < day__> matricks: in the '90s :o. when did you release the first teeworlds? or teewars?
10:02 < day__> the first kirby was released in '92. Does that mean you started developing teeworlds rougly 25years ago? O.O
10:13 < EastByte> day__: it's probably not about teeworlds, rather about the tee itself
10:20 < day__> EastByte: you dont design kirby and then 10years later decide to make a game. at least i think thats highly unlikely
10:39 <@matricks> day__: no, but teetow designed the tee for a band that he was in back in the '90
10:40 <@matricks> day__: and one day in like.. around 2000 somewhere, we decided to make a little game and that bugger became the character because he was easy to animate
10:49 < day__> :D
10:50 <@matricks> been many different versions of the game through the years
10:52 < day__> matricks: i hope Teetows band didnt create the menu music :x
10:52 <@matricks> no, teetow did however
10:52 < day__> hes not a musician anymore right? :D
10:52 <@matricks> do you ever stop being a musician? :)
10:52 <@matricks> he doesn't work with music professionally anymore
10:52 <@matricks> no
10:52 < heinrich5991> day__: he also created the music in the trailer
10:52 < day__> haha
10:52 < heinrich5991> (which is pretty awesome IMO)
10:52 < day__> i only remember two steps from hell trailers
10:52 < day__> or xraydog
10:53 <@matricks> he has done a lot of music :)
10:55 <@matricks> the trailer music is a revamp of an old old tw song as well
10:56 < day__> are you talking about the official steam trailer?
10:56 <@matricks> yap
10:58 < heinrich5991> that's pretty neat :)
11:20 <@minus> prominent example of his music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amz3rFaSRgM
12:18 <@matricks> oh noes...
12:18 <@matricks> I've started to get questions about steam...
12:19 <@matricks> some german reviewer wanted a steam key so they could review it....
12:20 < EastByte> ^^
12:21 < heinrich5991> is that reviewer aware of the fact that the game is free? :o
12:21 <@matricks> yeah, got that mail 1 minute later
12:22 < LittleWhite> ...
12:22 < LittleWhite> Are not they a bit silly :D
12:22 < LittleWhite> is that a real youtuber ? or maybe a guy trying to get keys to get the games free 
12:23 <@matricks> dunno
12:23 <@matricks> don't care
12:30 < LittleWhite> true
13:13 < Fels> oink
13:13 <@matricks> pig

13:14 < Fels> NO I DIDNT
13:14 < Savander> hahaha
13:19 < day__> who are the lead programmers of teeworlds atm?
13:19 < Fels> Savander ofcourse
13:19 <@matricks> Oy? dunno

13:26 < Savander> https://steamcommunity.com/app/380840/discussions/0/521643320369144424/
13:26 < Savander> :(
13:26 < Savander> it
14:08 < swick> so, congrats on the steam release
18:38 < day__> any idea what is going wrong here during the compiling of teeworlds? http://www.fpaste.org/259086/05206921/
18:48 < Savander> cuz, you should show as
18:48 < Savander> full log
18:49 < Savander> not only end of log
18:50 < day__> aww i was trying to be nice :3
18:54 < day__> stupid me assumed the process would interrupt on error. http://www.fpaste.org/259093/05216281/
18:54 < day__> line 135-145
18:55 < Savander> ah json
18:55 < day__> http://www.fpaste.org/259095/44052172/
18:55 < day__> thats what i get when i ./bam a second time
18:56 < day__> where do you see json?
18:56 < day__> 145 looks fine to my eyes :/
18:57 < day__> oh i thought SDL.h is something tw specific
18:59 < Henningstone> AUTO  sdl                  not found (required) ...seems you're missing smth? :)
18:59 < day__> yeah already noticed
19:00 < Henningstone> Savander: WOW did you recently took a look at this? http://steamcharts.com/app/380840
19:01 < Henningstone> it's more than the half of all players
19:01 < day__> so many full dm servers :3
19:01 < Henningstone> and the total number of players gone up by 200
19:07 < Savander> heinrich5991, ye
19:07 < Savander> 50% of players from steam
19:07 < Savander> :D
19:07 < Savander> my servers
19:07 < Savander> are really full
19:07 < Savander> 80+players
19:08 < Henningstone> woh, imagine what would happen if the player count doubles throughout the next weeks... or day :0
19:08 < Savander> don'tkwno :D
19:08 < Savander> it doubles
19:08 < Savander> from 300 to 700
19:08 < Savander> in one day
19:08 < Henningstone> yeah exactly, in ONE DAY
19:08 < Henningstone> that's it! :D
19:09 < Savander> ut
19:09 < Savander> but
19:09 < Savander> it was 400 players
19:09 < Henningstone> there are currently a total of ~1200 players on tw... average+200 in one day, now the week has another 5 days ^^
19:10 < Savander> 1200?
19:10 < Savander> i saw 1400 today
19:11 < Henningstone> I looked at it 5 mins before
19:11 < Savander> lol
19:11 < Savander> soryr
19:11 < Henningstone> but WOW 1400? rly?
19:11 < Savander> now is 1450

19:12 < Savander> i see 1450.
19:12 < Savander> ;P
19:12 < Savander> on 1000 servres
19:12 < LittleWhite> Toooo much people :D
19:12 < Henningstone> yeah, the serer count didn't rise thats the problem
19:12 < Henningstone> and will not rise so fast
19:13 < day__> wow that compile was worth it
19:13 < day__> the menu
19:13 < day__> so shiny
19:13 < day__> :O
19:13 < Henningstone> huh?
19:13 < day__> 0.7
19:14 < Henningstone> ah 0.7...
19:14 < day__> and no music <3
19:14 < day__> where are the search filters?
19:14 < Henningstone> a feature for choosing custom music files in tw would be awesome :D
19:15 < jxsl13> Savander
19:15 < jxsl13> your pm system in zcatch got no spam protection
19:19 < Savander> jxsl13,  hm?
19:19 < jxsl13> it is easily possible to chat spam via private messages
19:19 < Savander> i'll check this
19:20 < jxsl13> (not using ddnet client)
19:20 < jxsl13> didnt check for ddnet client
19:21 < Savander> i copied it
19:21 < Savander> from ddnet
19:21 < Savander> (deen told me i shoudl ^^)
19:21 < deen> but on ddnet we have spam protection :P
19:21 < Savander> on zctach
19:21 < Savander> too
19:21 < Savander> look into code
19:21 < jxsl13> don't play ddrace
19:22 < Savander> don't know why
19:22 < jxsl13> don't care :D
19:22 < Savander> you can spam it
19:22 < Savander> xD
19:22 < jxsl13> it's in whisperID()
19:22 < jxsl13> simpls add if(!mutevalidation(pPlayer)) return;
19:23 < Savander> i'll check it later :P
19:23 < jxsl13> don't know why it's actually !mutevailadtion and not normal mutevalidation like used before the normal chat stuff
19:45 < Learath2> i propose stripping all leading symbols and whitespace before sorting servers
19:46 < Henningstone> and "leading" means everything before the first letter?
19:48 < heinrich5991> Learath2: welcome to "A                                                                                !!my best server"
19:51 < Learath2> well there should be a way to do this properly
19:52 < Learath2> and newbies do seem to have some trouble with the game :P
19:52 < Henningstone> 1434
19:52 < Learath2> and i only see 576 players :/
19:53 < Henningstone> filters?
19:53 < deen> or no contact to 1 master server
19:53 < Learath2> filters :P
19:53 < Learath2> had to remove standart map
20:00 < cris272>  or the default order should be by ping, not server name
20:00 <@minus> https://www.teeworlds.com/?status=1 there's this thing displaying master status :D
20:01 < EastByte> hm I only see 720 servers
20:01 < deen> master2 has high packet loss
20:01 < Henningstone> lol there are only 2 masters left??
20:01 < deen> 50% for me
20:01 < heinrich5991> Henningstone: two masters for the last years
20:02 < Henningstone> never realized that oO
20:02 < Henningstone> ever thought that it are 4 
20:02 < heinrich5991> there are four possible masters :)
20:02 < day__> i can only remember one longer lasting master attack
20:03 < day__> i guess we will see more in the future :/
20:03 < EastByte> attacking the master servers is pretty contra-productive
20:03 < day__> how so?
20:03 < EastByte> counter-productive*
20:03 < day__> it dismantles the network
20:03 < day__> sure if you have favs. they still work
20:03 < EastByte> attackers mostly are part of the network
20:04 < EastByte> oh well might be different now
20:04 < day__> that depends on their intentions
20:04 < day__> some just want to see everything crash
20:04 < EastByte> if teeworlds gets to popular the next days, things will end up pretty bad
20:05 < Henningstone> average players +200 in one day... hm.
20:05 < heinrich5991> I doubt it will get much more popular
20:05 < heinrich5991> I'd even predict a slight decrease
20:05 < Henningstone> why should it decrease?
20:05 < day__> yeah. steam changes the scale, but not the fundamental problem
20:06 < Henningstone> Ã¤h, decrease of the total or decrease of the steam players? 
20:08 < heinrich5991> decrease of total players
20:24 < Learath2> and if a team is voting their teammate out it should be their decision not the whole servers
20:28 < day__> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8-HDUBbtgQ
20:35 < EastByte> ^
20:38 < Savander> 1550 players
20:39 < Henningstone> and new Steam peak of 712
20:40 < heinrich5991> (it's visible on the steam homepage)
20:40 < Savander> yup
20:41 < Savander> 753*
20:41 < Savander> on steam
20:41 < Henningstone> oh streamcharts.com is not up to date :D
20:41 < Henningstone> *steamcharts
20:41 < Savander> http://steamcommunity.com/app/380840
20:42 < Henningstone> saw it, 754 now :P
20:42 < Savander> it's most recent
20:42 < Henningstone> hooo and 1512 ingame
20:43 < Henningstone> lol I just joined a vanilla server, and 11/16 without skin xD looks so strange
20:44 < Savander> :)
20:45 < Savander> 100players on teeworlds.pl servers
20:45 < Savander> <hehe>
20:47 < Henningstone> so funny, just played a round, instant at the top.
20:48 <@minus> deen | master2 has high packet loss â i've had outages rather often on that one the last weeks
20:48 <@minus> time to replace that one
21:38 < Pathos> Rowdy chat today
21:38 < Pathos> Should be using Steam chat
21:39 < Henningstone> ?
21:42 < jxsl13> no
21:42 < jxsl13> thou shalt not pass
21:50 < day__> is it normal that i do not find any playable games in the 0.7trunk version?
21:50 <@minus> yeah
21:50 < heinrich5991> nobody is hosting an up-to-date 0.7 server
21:51 < Savander> it's should be filtered?
21:52 < Savander> i mean, servers from 0.6 shouldn't be visible in server list?
21:52 < day__> i think it shows them grey, with 999ping and 0/0 players
21:53 <@minus> did someone just say bloom filters?
21:54 < jxsl13> bloomers!
22:07 < Learath2> the serverlist really looks ugly :D
22:08 < Savander> hm?D:
22:08 < Learath2> !                       My EPIC CLAN SERVER
22:08 < Savander> XD
22:08 < Savander> !       Teeworlds.pl
22:08 < Savander> xD
22:09 < Savander> servers hosted on OVH cheapest server xD
22:09 < Savander> 3$
22:09 < Savander> or less xD
22:10 < Learath2> lets make the default sorting ping
22:10 <@minus> or players
22:10 < Savander> or
22:10 < Savander> just don't sort antyhing
22:10 < Savander> xDD
22:10 <@minus> bad idea
22:10 < Savander> why?
22:11 <@minus> you could manipulate that
22:11 < Savander> how?
22:11 <@minus> i forgot
22:11 < Savander> or just first sort by name
22:11 < Savander> then shuffle it.
22:11 < Learath2> players would encourage people putting bots in servers
22:11 < Savander> better by ping then
22:11 < Savander> for everyone will be better
22:12 < Savander> newcomers entering first server on list
22:12 < Savander> xd
22:12 < Fels> by ping, if its not possible to fake it
22:12 <@minus> sort servers with players first, then sort those by ping
22:12 < Savander> or sort by name and ping
22:12 < Learath2> or just lets master ban all the weird named servers until they get a proper name
22:12 <@minus> Fels | by ping, if its not possible to fake it â yeah, this isn't Soldat :D
22:12 < Savander> Learath2, why you want to ban servers
22:12 < Savander> with "!         "
22:12 < Savander> ?
22:12 < Savander> :D
22:13 < Savander> it's not modified server
22:13 < Savander> just name.
22:13 < Learath2> makes the server list look retarded
22:13 < Savander> And that's reason to ban those servers?
22:13 < Savander> Don't think so
22:13 < Learath2> roll in new naming rules give them a week to fix it ban them all
22:14 < Savander> it's stupid
22:14 < Fels> just make it, that you cant use 500 spaces inbetween words
22:14 < Savander> yup.
22:14 < Savander> one space
22:18 < Fels> oink
22:19 < Savander> kwa
22:19 < Pathos> foxlet: TW was released on Steam
22:23 < foxlet> Pathos: Huh.
22:24 < foxlet> Pathos: Iâm a bit confused on the 1.4Ghz requirement, Iâm pretty sure it ran on 800Mhz (PPC).
22:24 < Pathos> Yeah it's not true at all
22:24 < heinrich5991> foxlet: suggest new system requirements
22:26 < foxlet> heinrich5991: The lowest Iâve managed has 128MB/800Mhz 
22:27 < foxlet> But with Linux on MESA.
23:03 <@matricks> I ran teeworlds with netbsd on a squirrel carcass
23:10 <@teetow> poor squirrel =(
