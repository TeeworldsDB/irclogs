01:30 < bridge_> <d_une> I don't think the point of github has ever been to distribute or dilute authority
01:31 < bridge_> <d_une> chillerdragon: despite echoing your sentiment I would correct that development died before oy went inactive for the most part
02:15 < nev> the point doesn't matter, what matter is what the platform allows, github allows for organizations and membership access over a repo, removing the distributed aspect of a repo
02:25 < bridge_> <d_une> Do you know of any FOSS that works otherwise?
02:27 < nev> yes, linux
02:28 < nev> anything that is not hosted on github basically
02:28 < nev> and uses pure git
02:29 < nev> I'm under the assumption here that oy has complete control over the github repo
02:34 < bridge_> <d_une> whether it's on github or another git server not doesn't really change much, you have a myriad of repositories, each with their own restricted set of people with push access. Linux also has a restricted set of people with push access
02:40 < nev> now I'm confused
02:40 < nev> 1 person has commit access vs >1 == same result
02:40 < nev> idgi
02:40 < bridge_> <d_une> what's confusing?
02:43 < nev> is that your argument?
02:45 < bridge_> <d_une> So you're saying if we had several Oys it would be fine? That's still not "distributed", you just have a small group of people that need to closely agree on what should get in - and often work with some form of hierarchy
02:46 < nev> aye, its a cathedratic/distributed model
02:46 < nev> its how most big FOSS are done
02:49 < nev> also a hierarchy is not strictly the only method.
02:50 < nev> you could vote if you want to merge the PR, you could accept anything unless someone disagrees
02:50 < nev> you could have a bdfl
09:54 < bridge_> <d_une> I have never heard of democracy based FOSS developement, it has to be at best very niche (and for a reason)
09:54 < bridge_> <d_une> a bdfl is a form of hierarchy
13:29 < bridge_> <jxsl13> monarchy :0?
13:52 < ChillerDragon> nev NEVer saw u before xd do you use some other names? whats your in game name? What do you play? Whats your github?
13:53 < bridge_> <jxsl13> Do or did you even play the game?
14:02 < minus> dictatorships are the most effective form of government
14:03 < bridge_> <jxsl13> minus is like a vampire, he is afraid of the +
19:45 < nev> I used to go by Edible
19:46 < nev> I haven't played in a couple of years but I started in 2012 or so
19:46 < nev> and I'm still shit, as you can see if you check the DDNet ranks
19:49 < bridge_> <heinrich5991> I remember the name Edible ðŸ™‚
19:50 < nev> I remember you heinrich
19:50 < nev> :)
