10:35 < dragonchaser> hi
10:36 < chaser1> I have a question about docker, I have created a Dockerfile for running a dedicated teeworlds server. I was wondering if I am allowed to push this image onto dockerhub
10:36 < chaser1> (sorry your license is a bit unclear to me)
11:57 < minus> the license does allow that, chaser1
11:58 < chaser1> minus: thx
