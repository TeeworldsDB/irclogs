14:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Fonts have one great benefit, they scale very well, no matter what resolution we are running at the icons from fonts will look crisp. Images on the other hand are well known to be shit for scaling, hence everyone having to ship 50 versions of their icons/logos at different resolutions.
14:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You could I guess ship one icon at very high resolution, but it's both wasteful AND there is no "best" algorithm for downscaling
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Now that we are removing RBG-File format and removed an attack vector, can we add SVG support? `This is a troll question`
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> If you have that annoying blue dot over your github `profile`, take a look at Feature Preview <.< somehow the notification is broken
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I know you said troll question but I am actually considering a script that bundles our icons into a font
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Like we put a bunch of svgs in an icons folder, the script produces an opentype font + generates a header so we can have pretty names for our icons
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Though I guess that's not really "svg support" :P
16:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I mean allowing svg images as mapres (quads and tilesets)
17:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Heh would be cute imho. I love vector graphics
17:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> future proof 2d game
17:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Very high space efficiency, very very high quality on any screen size/resolution/dpi combo
17:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> then ppl started to complain how hard it is to make new mapres skins and game.svg
17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The only small issue is that you either need a high performance vector rendering in shader (slug is pretty good) or you need to render it out into a texture

17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> 8k teeworlds when?
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> it might be possible to break svg down to triangle drawcalls, but that is still quite stupid probably.
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> That would be silly ðŸ˜›
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but thats how i imagine it would be done without shaders. imagine being the keyword
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Slug handles bezier curves directly, itâ€™s really as good as it gets when rendering vector gfx on the gpu
17:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> anyway, i would love to have a svg2ttf pipeline if you have any idea on how
17:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Without shaders I would just render the curves out into a texture so itâ€™s like it was in the past
17:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> it seems like fontforge's scripting can do that but i don't know if it is a good idea to depend on that
17:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I have a couple ideas, maybe Iâ€™ll take a look after dinner
17:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> looking forward to your solution
