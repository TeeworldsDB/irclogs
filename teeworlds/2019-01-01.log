00:03 <@Dune> merry new year
00:11 < Sajadi> Happy new year :)
00:24 < TeeSlayer> happy new teeyear
00:33 < TeeSlayer> is Muffin, the developer of conquest here?
00:34 < TeeSlayer> @MuffinMario
00:35 < TeeSlayer> I need the maps for Conquest to host it. I don't have them here neither are they being hosted anywhere on Teeworlds
00:41 < TeeSlayer> ahhh they're in the release zip
00:42 < TeeSlayer> they aren't on the repo that's why I was confused
07:16 <@heinrich5991> happy new year :)
10:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> Happy new year heinrich
16:11 <@Dune> My filters keep getting reset :(
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> TeeSlayer: I've updated zomb again, https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=122379#p122379
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> also happy new year everyone ðŸ˜ƒ
19:18 < TeeSlayer> LordSk: Thanks. I just updated them.
19:20 < TeeSlayer> @LordSk: Is it possible to disable flying for zombies? Or is the pathfinding not optimized for land travel? :D
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> that was choice I made when I started making the mod
19:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> zombies should be able to travel all maps
19:21 < TeeSlayer> It's not a problem on the three standard maps, but other maps would seem weird
19:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> but in practice that means they indeed fly when the map is set up for it
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I'll definitely choose another approach if I do a Zomb 4 someday
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> but for now, build better suited maps ðŸ˜ƒ
19:25 < TeeSlayer> it's alright, but if you ever enable more player slots (and more actual players as well), it will be harder to make good maps since you would want the zombies to not only come from left right, but top right, top left, bottom right, bottom left etc
19:26 < TeeSlayer> unless it's a cave :P
19:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah, it would also make more sense if zombies were more grounded
19:29 < TeeSlayer> on the other hand this ensures that they can't die from falling in the abyss^^
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah and every map basically works ðŸ˜ƒ
