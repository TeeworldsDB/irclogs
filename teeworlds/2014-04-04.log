16:46 < JulianAssange> im now in crossiaunt land
17:28 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: do you know where to look up vulnerabilities of certain kernel versions?
17:28 < heinrich5991> or more generally, software versions?
17:29 < JulianAssange> do you want to know if it's vulnerable
17:29 < JulianAssange> or know the exploit
17:34 < JulianAssange> either way, osvdb.org is one, and cvedetails.com
17:34 < JulianAssange> example of cvedetils: http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-51/Ubuntu.html
17:35 < JulianAssange> example of osvdb: http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/102551
17:35 < JulianAssange> (even though i told them it wasn't my exploit they credited it to me -/-)
17:50 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: just whether it is vulnerable or not
18:10 < JulianAssange> cvedetails best probably
18:27 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: I'd like to see security vulnerabilities of a specific kernel version, 3.10.34, is there a way to see this on that website?
19:39 < JulianAssange> http://www.scip.ch/en/?vuldb.12725 heinrich5991 ?
20:23 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: thanks, so it's not really safe running linux 3.10.34 :)
21:48 < JulianAssange> why don't u just update to latest
21:49 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: cause reboot :D
21:50 < JulianAssange> just do it lol
21:51 < JulianAssange> the bigger your uptime is, the smaller your e-peen gets.
