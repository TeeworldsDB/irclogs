12:58 < _3DA> Hi, guys
12:59 < _3DA> Cannot post thread on the forum:
12:59 < _3DA> Sorry! The page could not be loaded.  Could not connect to smtp host "mail.mnus.de:465" (101) (Network is unreachable).
13:10 <@minus> ah, sorry
13:10 <@minus> will take a bit to longer fix, _3DA
13:10 <@minus> somehow that machine lost 2 weeks worth of data and needs to be reverted now
13:30 < _3DA> it is sad
13:40 < _3DA> Guys. What do you think about integration with Steam? I think it would be great to bind steam accounts with Teeworlds accounts.
13:43 <@minus> there are no teeworlds accounts though
13:46 < _3DA> I know. But it is possible to make teeworlds account as steam account. Isn't it?
13:46 <@minus> there's no point to that for the base game
13:46 <@minus> i doubt it'll ever go that way
13:47 < _3DA> I guess it will create good boost for creating custom mods with saving progress
13:49 <@minus> probably, but teeworlds itself discourages mods, so there's that
13:52 < _3DA> So why official teeworlds developers doesn't make some major changes to involve new players? Is not good to that that your game is playable of much people?
13:53 < _3DA> to see that*
14:03 <@heinrich5991> _3DA: are you *the* 3da? :o
14:06 < _3DA> yep
14:07 <@minus> who is _the_ 3da?
14:07 <@heinrich5991> uh :)
14:07 <@heinrich5991> one of the guys creating ddrace
14:08 <@minus> ah
14:08 < _3DA> it was too long ago
14:09 <@heinrich5991> _3DA: but I think accounts do not really fit to teeworlds
14:09 <@heinrich5991> you're supposed to jump in and be indistinguishable from any other player, except maybe for skill level
14:13 < _3DA> I see that years go by and Teeworlds almost the same as it was when I started play it
14:13 < _3DA> Why here is no major changes to involve new players and update interest for old players?
14:14 <@heinrich5991> development is mostly stuck
14:14 <@minus> fwiw i hate accounts/levels/upgrades
14:14 <@heinrich5991> oy recently started developing again though
14:14 <@minus> i just want to jump in and play for a while and not get pwned by players that happen to have a higher level
14:15 <@heinrich5991> _3DA: ddnet is the new ddrace btw, if you want to look at that
14:15 <@heinrich5991> https://ddnet.tw/ https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet and #ddnet
14:15 <@minus> ddnet probably is the future of teeworlds
14:16 < _3DA> There was many developers who created mods and utilites. If official developers used their skills and creativity, then teeworlds could developed faster.
14:16 < _3DA> I heard about ddnet
14:17 < _3DA> When I started to play Teeworlds, I also player Dota 2. But now I still play Dota 2 because it is not boring (because something is changes everytime). But teeworlds is boring now
14:17 <@heinrich5991> dota 2 was already a thing when you started playing TW? :o
14:17 < _3DA> 8 years ago I prefered Teeworlds
14:17 < _3DA> now I prefer dota 2
14:18 < _3DA> I started playing teeworlds in 2008 or 2009
14:19 < _3DA> I played dota 1
14:19 < _3DA> you are right
14:19 < _3DA> May be we need something like Teeworlds 2.0 ?
14:20 < _3DA> >i just want to jump in and play for a while and not get pwned by players that happen to have a higher level.
14:20 < _3DA> I agree
14:20 < _3DA> in Dota 2 we has accounts and donation doesn't affect gameplay
14:21 < _3DA> I just wanted to see Teeworlds great again
14:29 <@heinrich5991> mh. you do notice the worrying lack of enthusiasm here? :(
14:30 < Learath2> teeworlds 2.0 would need a team to write, which I doubt we can gather at this point
14:31 < Learath2> not a team that would agree in which language to write it, which principles to keep, what to add anyways
14:34 <@heinrich5991> I don't think it'd be impossible
14:35 <@heinrich5991> anyway, as long as we're not there yet, I'm writing it in rust :D https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2
14:37 < _3DA> Sounds sad
14:39 <@heinrich5991> which part? ? :P
14:39 <@heinrich5991> s/ \?//
14:39 < _3DA> about enthusiasm
14:39 <@heinrich5991> yea
14:39 < _3DA> The best years of teeworlds for me is 2009-2010
14:40 < _3DA> Is it only subjective perception?
14:40 < _3DA> Many clans and tournaments was in that years
14:41 < _3DA> Most aversome mods was created in that years
14:41 < _3DA> or not?
14:43 <@heinrich5991> tw has lost quite a bit of its popularity, I think
14:43 < _3DA> yep
14:43 <@heinrich5991> new mods don't appear anymore, the forum is dead again
14:44 < _3DA> but which years are the best for tw?
14:44 <@heinrich5991> I think we had the latter one before, but it was somehow revived
14:46 < _3DA> someone uses Telegram?
14:48 < _3DA> I guess the one reason is why teeworlds is not popular is that tw is very hardcore
14:48 < _3DA> Modern players are not hardcore
15:16 < _3DA> Is it possible to make game like Teeworlds but more friendly to new players?
15:43  * _3DA slaps heinrich5991 around a bit with a large fishbot
15:49 < Learath2> _3DA: yeah getting new players is very hard with a learning curve this steep
15:51 < _3DA> players prefer games where they can feel themselves good after some hours of playing but not after some months
15:51 < _3DA> :D
15:52 < _3DA> Also mobile games market damages teeworlds popularity
19:03 <@matricks> games comes and goes
19:03 <@matricks> the market now adays is a lot different
