00:42 <@matricks> minus: it kinda was
07:41 <@minus> Ã–D
07:42 <@minus> derp, german kezboard
08:11 <@matricks> :P
11:06 < Flai> Hey guys, is there any way to add an remote-log via UDP as in source-engine the logaddress_add command?
11:07 < Flai> And is there somewhere a full cvar-list besides that ingame?
12:04 < Learath2> Flai: you mean config variables by cvar ?
23:01 < Learath2> hey minus you around ?
23:02 <@minus> sure
23:02 < Learath2> you redirect teeworlds.com to https://teeworlds.com
23:02 < Learath2> and i think you use nginx
23:02 < Learath2> been trying to achieve that for like last 30 mins :D
23:02 < Learath2> can you give me a hand
23:03 < BotoX> wow
23:03 <@minus> 2 servers, one listens on http, one on https
23:03 < Learath2> exactly what i am doing
23:03 < Learath2> http one returns 301
23:04 < BotoX> https://p.botox.bz/bace.nginx
23:04 < BotoX> there you go m8
23:04 < BotoX> https://p.botox.bz/basa.nginx
23:05 < Learath2> well you are using a rewrite
23:05 < Learath2> that should work too i guess
23:05 < BotoX> well, I am.
23:05 < BotoX> look at sakura.tea for dual-stack
23:05 < BotoX> simply listen 80;
23:05 < BotoX> and listen 443 ssl;
23:06 < BotoX> default.conf https://p.botox.bz/yipa.nginx
23:06 < BotoX> this enables ipv6 and spdy for every other server block
23:06 < Learath2> server_name _?
23:06 < BotoX> the rewrite is just there to rewrite IP to hostname
23:06 < BotoX> yeah
23:07 < BotoX> default_server
23:07 < BotoX> no particular name has to be given
23:07 < BotoX> everything that isn't already registered elsewhere
23:08 < BotoX> I'm also using HHVM for some PHP stuff
23:08 < BotoX> instead of PHP-FPM
23:09 < Learath2> BotoX: http://wiki.nginx.org/Pitfalls#Taxing_Rewrites
23:09 < Learath2> and why hhvm ?
23:10 < Learath2> simply for the performance ?
23:10 < BotoX> yep
23:10 < BotoX> faster
23:11 < BotoX> in case the application is supported
23:11 < BotoX> most normal stuff works fine
23:11 < BotoX> but bigger frameworks don't
23:17 < Learath2> BotoX: you run a pretty big setup there :P
23:17 < BotoX> ah well, that's just one domain with some stuff missing though :3
23:17 < Learath2> why do you need all this :P
23:18 < BotoX> idk, reasons
23:22 < Learath2> BotoX: are you using a self signed key ?
23:22 < Learath2> nvm
23:22 < Learath2> you arent
23:23 <@matricks> night people
23:23 < Learath2> its a wildcard cert you paid for 
23:23 < Learath2> n8 matricks
23:23 <@matricks> new day tomorrow o/
23:30 < BotoX> Want to know how much I payed for that, Learath2 ? :3
23:31 < BotoX> Probably overpaid too, 5$ for a year :o
23:31 < BotoX> I might be able to get one free this year
23:31 < BotoX> or 100$ for 5 years if anyone is interested
23:33 < Learath2> wtf 
23:33 < Learath2> where did you even get that price
23:33 < BotoX> internet
23:33 < BotoX> well, a friend of mine did some work at an alphassl reseller
23:34 < Learath2> meh broke it 
23:34 < BotoX> they get those for free, pretty much
23:34 < BotoX> The SSL business is printing money, pretty much.
23:41 < Learath2> meh broke the server 
23:48 < BotoX> oh my god
23:48 < BotoX> I ran out of milk
23:48 < BotoX> on saturday night
23:48 < BotoX> worst thing to ever happen in my life
23:51 < Learath2> you drink milk ?
23:54 < BotoX> lots of milk
23:54 < BotoX> at least 1L per day
23:55 < BotoX> well, guess it was more like 2L today
