05:26 < Landil> the less players have to move the mouse to do coherent clicks the better the UI
05:27 < Landil> function first ... form follows function
05:40 < Landil> Regarding "Add flag for ai-controlled players #1390", you might have a look at the quick concept here https://i.imgur.com/n6CfN7G.png An archetype robot antenna. One might think about an animation of radio waves, if people tend to hide the antennas with a decoration, but I am not a big fan of it. Not yet another animation :/ I like the two antennas at the bottom with custumizable colors :D Some shading could be done there
05:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> cool antennas Landil, i like it a lot
05:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I also tought about a chip implantat maybe wich size varies by the bots difficulty if there are difficulties
05:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> animation could be played when bot spawns / gets activated / triggered by the player with the ninja eyes at the same time then after that evil eyes
05:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> that would make the player know the bot has locked his target at him
06:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> however I think bots should have a clear color scheme (metalic grey) with only the antenna glow red and eventually the chip green / brown, they should be instantly recognisable.
08:16 < Landil> Zatline ... I would test antennas only first. The more simple the solution the better
08:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> agree but isn't a unifuied color sheme (white / grey) more simple than all sorts of colors? curious
09:53 < Landil> zatline uhmmm ... antennas with a choosable color for the circles then? (besides, I prefer the two antennas version)
09:54 < Landil> imo we are supposed to give the antennas a try and see. If it is not enuf then we can add a color scheme afterwards.
09:56 < Landil> Adding sth. afterwards is easier than taking away sth. some people might like
09:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> "that would make the player know the bot has locked his target at him" don't think that is possible @Zatline
09:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> You can't change skin info ingame anymore
10:03 < rand> you can with silent message info iirc
10:06 < rand> or I misunderstood https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/4584c1693556a13115ba1bb1323b67d11ddb6be7
10:09 < rand> anyway, players don't change skin when focusing on another player, IAs shouldn't behave visualy differently
10:10 < rand> the two antenna sound like a nice and sufficient solution :)
10:35 < rand> (well I don't like the design on the picture, I'd prefer special eyes)
12:16 < Landil> what about the following approach for bots: instead of a black outline we could use a red one and only certain skins (circular shaped tee body) are allowed, to reduce the added red outline to one additional skin file huh*
12:17 < Landil> at least an additional idea
13:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> +1 with rand, that sounds way too complicated. it should be a simple added cosmetic
13:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> eyes or antenna
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I think two antennas look silly, would go with a single antenna

19:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I'd rather have nothing distracting/animated :|
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> well maybe some animations could fresh up tw a bit .. I'd defenetly go with a robotic color sheme tho
19:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> well maybe .. animations could fresh up tw a bit however I would defenetly go with a robotic color sheme tho
20:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> like the skins @Zatline rly good
20:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there should only be some additional skin parts if you want server owners to be able to introduce bots with custom skins
20:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> https://gyazo.com/f131558c4cd25e23a1e1a9f187636ade
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> why all the colors? :o
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> this would make bot vary among themself but in a way players could not replicate them and meanwhile they are very distinguishable, easy reconisable
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> this would make bots vary among themself but in a way players could not replicate them and meanwhile they are very distinguishable, easy reconisable
20:43 <@Dune> well, if we want distinguishable players we can already give them custom skin colors, right?
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> no they would look like a human controled tee then
20:44 <@Dune> not with the antenna?
20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> it's too close imo it doesn't seem distinguishable enough
20:46 <@Dune> I don't think it's supposed to be a huge thing
20:47 <@Dune> just a little indicator, like different eyes or antenna
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I like that bots are almost whith rn, now give them a bit more love by having an antenna, tattoos and eye color synced with color of antenna and u have a very nice extremly distinguishable look
20:47 <@Dune> I question whether we want an "extremly distinguishable look"
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I'd love them to look like robots tho not like player controled tees
20:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> feedback pls :D
20:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/329471/49247599-f6fcfc00-f417-11e8-8abc-6c21851d9162.png
20:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> what if I want an antenna on my custom skin?
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> not bad @Fisico
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> looks nice @Fisico
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> well then u chose the antenna but u then still wouldn't look like a real bot
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> If I make my skin all white  Iwould
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well then it would be deliberate to have a botlike-antenna downloaded
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> (and skin)
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> which is the overall goal, players should not be able to replicate the exact look of a real bot
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it shouldn't be treated as a reliable way to identify bots imo
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> alright great then
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> we only need an antenna now
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> skin and add a small icon in the scoreboard... or set a flag?
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> countryflag i main
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> *mean
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there is already a flag @Fisico
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> > If I make my skin all white  Iwould
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> no u wouldn't bot still has colored eyes tho ^^
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> u wouldn't be able to replecate that so easy
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> can we make something really simple tho?
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> an antenna image
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> KISS :)
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> skin all white
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> boom done.
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think even the antenna is enough. doesn't have to be standing out
20:58 < Landil> Fisico ... far tooo detailed. Check your design on a low resolution pls.
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the color can be tuned server side
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Fisico ^
20:58 < Landil> and please use the same outline thickness
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @landil yea thats true...
21:13 < Landil> [20:58] Landil: Fisico ... far tooo detailed. Check your design on a low resolution pls.
21:13 < Landil> I mean, if you cannot see the details on a low resolution you can drop them
21:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yes i saw that already
21:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> will try some stuff
21:39 <@Dune> rand: do you think it would be good to resize the block/addfriend checkboxes in the Players tab when there are many players like that?
21:42 < rand> it does use the max size am I wrong ?
21:42 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] LordSk opened pull request #1743: Fixed editor world mouse delta (used when moving quad points) (master...fix/editor_mouse_delta) https://git.io/fpwlL
21:43 <@Dune> rand: so it adjusts to the height of the line?
21:59 < rand> I did not change the size of the checkbox, it is the same as the original
22:05 <@Dune> I think they should be changed to fit the text font size changes, shouldn't they?
23:23 < rand> i didn't change the fontsize
