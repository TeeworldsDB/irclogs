11:22 < Obani> Got some insomny this night
11:23 < Obani> It was very productive, you might see some new issues soon
11:57 <@matricks> :)
11:59 < Obani> I thought about a new super weapon this night
11:59 < Obani> Some kind of telt III
12:00 < Obani> I'll make some POC images and let you see it
12:03 <@matricks> as an alternative to the ninja?
12:03 < Obani> yep
12:04 < Obani> But completely different
12:04 < Obani> I was thinking to some kind of Rocket Launcher with only 2 ammo
12:05 < Obani> Launching 5 missiles at speed 2000, with no curvature, and a life time of 1 sec
12:07 <@matricks> maybe, invisibility?
12:07 <@matricks> only visible for 1 second when shooting
12:08 < Obani> Well, I was more thinking about a big badass weapon :p
12:09 <@matricks> just thinking out loud about different upgrades :)
12:09 <@matricks> I always intended it for to be more then one
12:09 < Obani> Well teeworlds is more about weapons
12:10 < Obani> It's hard to me to visualize powerups like invincibility, invisibility, extra hook,...
12:12 < heinrich5991> extra hook? how do you control that? ^^
12:12 <@matricks> well, the powerups was supposed to be weird and quirky
12:13 < Obani> Do you know padman ?
12:14 <@matricks> rings a bell
12:14 < Obani> ?
12:14 <@matricks> I've heard the name, but not much more then that
12:15 < Obani> It's a good FPS
12:15 < Obani> Anyway, if you don't know padman, you might not know the super weapon of it
13:50 < heinrich5991> fn foo() -> i32 { return return return return!!!!11 }
13:50 < heinrich5991> ^ rust :)
13:51 <@matricks> lol
13:51 <@matricks> are you allowed to have several return?
13:52 < heinrich5991> return is a diverging expression, so you're allowed to use it in a value context for any type
13:52 < heinrich5991> useful for things like
13:52 <@matricks> ok
13:52 <@matricks> I like rust
13:52 < heinrich5991> let something = if i > 0 { i } else { return; }
14:16 <@minus> matricks │ maybe, invisibility? ← steal all the quake power ups!
14:28 <@matricks> minus: rest of the game is stolen from there so :D
14:28 <@matricks> minus: but I was not talking about permanent invis
14:28 <@matricks> if you fire, you become visible for a short period
15:00 < Obani> like in ghost mod
15:00 < Obani> (teeworlds)
15:04 < day> problem with powerups in tw, is they need to be useful in different modes. 1on1 stealth would be very strong. in a pup 10player game completely useless
15:05 < day> triple nades on the other hand :o..
15:08 < Obani> that telt powerup I talked about can be useful to do massive damages or zone damages :)
15:09 < Obani> has ninja is pretty useless versus many shotty players ^^
15:09 < Obani> also I need to begin my new ctf7
15:09 < Obani> I made the POC this night has a drawing
15:10 < Obani> but first, new issue
15:13 < day> thorshammer instead of the wood hammer would be awesome 
15:13 < day> bigger aoe more damage + thunder :D
15:23 < Obani> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1424
15:24 <@matricks> wtf
15:25 < Obani> I really know nothing to programmation :x
15:25 < heinrich5991> why don't you use a music player? :)
15:25 <@matricks> heinrich5991: dude, better add the kitchen sink!
15:26 < Obani> ?¿
15:26 < heinrich5991> the question would be why this should be added to teeworlds
15:26 <@matricks> Obani: this is classical feature creeping
15:26 < Obani> Wouldn't you like to have a game soundtrack ?
15:26 < Obani> matricks, what do you mean ?
15:27 <@matricks> Obani: you start adding useless stuff just because
15:27 <@matricks> and the scope of the project just increases and causes cruft
15:27 <@matricks> teeworlds isn't about maximalism, it's about minimalism
15:27 < Obani> Ok so just use the label function of Github
15:27 < Obani> and set a label Priority : Low
15:28 <@matricks> personally, I don't know why the menu music was added
15:28 < Obani> Cause it's cool ! :D
15:29 <@matricks> is it worth it?
15:29 < Obani> no one uses a music player into casual players
15:29 <@matricks> to be fair, teeworlds was supposed to have music
15:29 <@matricks> but that system has never been written
15:29 < Obani> And as the game joined Steam, those useless features you talk about are becoming more and more important for players
15:30 <@matricks> fuck steam
15:30 <@matricks> and I was against the whole steam thing from the very beginning
15:30 < Obani> I agree that the graphical thing with artist and name is a very very very low priority feature
15:30 < heinrich5991> we should put an operating system into teeworlds
15:31 < Obani> ?¿
15:31 <@matricks> if teeworlds were to have music it should be context sensitive with smooth transitions
15:31 <@matricks> that was planned, but never implemented
15:31 < Obani> smooth transition is about music author
15:31 <@matricks> don't just slap on an mp3 and call it a day
15:32 < Obani> blank_lenght is here for that
15:32 <@matricks> ...
15:32 <@matricks> Obani: taths..
15:32 <@matricks> no
15:32 <@matricks> just no
15:32 < Obani> ok
15:32 < Obani> I'm just arguing :)
15:32 <@minus> how does input work in teeworlds? is a key press submitted to the server immediately or is that sampled at a specific frequency?
15:32 <@matricks> the thing I'm talking about is adding and removing parts of the music depending on context
15:33 <@matricks> and switching styles at beats etc
15:33 < heinrich5991> minus: sampled at a specific frequency
15:33 <@matricks> and perhaps synchronizing sounds to beats et
15:33 <@matricks> etc
15:33 <@minus> thanks heinrich5991
15:33 < heinrich5991> but clicking etc. is counted
15:33 <@matricks> heinrich5991: more then that, it's based on events as well
15:33 < heinrich5991> so it won't be missed
15:33 <@matricks> exact :)
15:34 < Obani> gonna begin work on my new ctf7
15:34 <@matricks> Obani: and for that, you can't just take music and add it, you need to auther it for the game
15:34 <@minus> in your client, other tees are predicted, right? how are prediction errors handled?
15:34 < heinrich5991> minus: other tees aren't predicted, they're interpolated IIRC
15:35 <@minus> but that means they're behind, doesn't it?
15:36 < heinrich5991> yes
15:36 < heinrich5991> but only a little
15:36 <@minus> okay
15:36 <@minus> what's the sampling rate for input?
15:37 < Stitch626> which client? o:
15:37 <@minus> and is it transmitted at the same rate?
15:37 < heinrich5991> minus: it's sampled at the time of transmission IIRC
15:37 < heinrich5991> and I don't know about hte latter
15:37 < heinrich5991> probably either 25 or 50 times per second, but only if it changed
15:38 <@minus> okay
15:38 <@minus> thanks, heinrich5991
15:38 < Stitch626> heinrich5991: which client?
15:38 < heinrich5991> teeworlds
15:38 < heinrich5991> standard client
15:39 < heinrich5991> afk for some minutes
15:39 < Obani> matricks, I'm musician
15:48 < Obani> :/
15:49 < Obani> This is quite nasty to kick like that :D
15:51 <@matricks> quite nasty of you to break the rules
15:55 < Obani> Well I'm not used to rules like this
16:18 <@minus> all the more important to read them thoroughly
16:19 < heinrich5991> mh mh
16:19 < heinrich5991> nobody reads rules
16:25 < Obani> :p
16:25 < Obani> Began my map
16:25 < Obani> Was hard to get back to teeworlds editor
16:27 < Obani> nice new grass tiles :)
16:28 < heinrich5991> are there new grass tiles? ^^
16:29 < Obani> since 0.7 yes :)
16:30 < heinrich5991> ah yea
16:30  * matricks goes home from work
16:30 < Obani> bb :)
18:48  * minus goes home from work
18:57 < Obani> Ok so I made a quick rework of ctf7
18:57 < Obani> Where can I share it ?
18:59 < heinrich5991> the forums would probably be the best place for that
19:00 < Obani> yes but to upload ?
19:01 < heinrich5991> e.g. solidfiles.com
19:07 < Obani> http://www.solidfiles.com/d/890aa27c01/
19:07 < heinrich5991> post a screenshot of your map! :)
19:37 < Obani> heinrich5991, video coming soon :)
19:37 < Obani> https://imgrush.com/qpla-grV5gs_
19:38 < heinrich5991> thanks!
19:38 < heinrich5991> a screenshot would probably also be helpful for people who don't want to watch a whole video :)
19:39 < Obani> afk
19:39 < Obani> a screenshot is too short
19:40 < Obani> and it would need at least 7 screenshots : I don't want to flood the issue :)
19:40 < Obani> afk
19:42 < heinrich5991> you can zoom out in the editor. and you should probably rather post your map to the forums, not to the issue tracker
20:26 < Lord_Delta> hey Stitch626 is a pedophile
20:26 < Lord_Delta> ban him
20:26 < Lord_Delta> he is stalking my little sister

20:31 <@matricks> terrorist
20:31 < EastByte> We have to deal with him for a while now
20:31 < heinrich5991> just ignore him in public channels, he's obviously out for attention
20:32 < heinrich5991> (and kick him obviously)
20:34 < EastByte> Kicking is the opposite of ignoring in case of trolls :/

23:12 < Stitch626> what means "yes (no)" ?
23:12 < Stitch626> o:
23:12 <@matricks> deleted from public view, perhaps not from moderators view
