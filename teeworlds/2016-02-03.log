00:05 < Phobos_> Ich weiß
00:09 < Phobos_> How to use tournament mode?
00:23 <@heinrich5991> sv_tournament_mode 1 means that people join in the spectator team
01:24 < Phobos_> thanks
01:24 < Phobos_> there is trouble
01:26 < Phobos_> may sb help?
01:28 < rand> maybe
01:41 < Phobos_> Why if i set 16 or more spectator slots, i may not paly, only be spectator?
01:42 < Kirbs> because that means that all of the slots are reserved for spectators; so no slots are for the players
01:42 < Kirbs> that can be used to set up 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, etc
01:42 < rand> dunno why it is not sv_player_slots instead
01:43 < Kirbs> that would make more sense really
01:43 < Kirbs> 6 players, derp
01:43 < Kirbs> instead of putting in "10" you could put in 6
01:45 < rand> because teeworlds is a spectacular game, you want to define how many people will watch a game!
01:45 < rand> spectactors first :)
01:45 < Phobos_> But for players 32 slots
01:45 < Phobos_> for spectators 16
01:46 < rand> you can set sv_spectator_slots to any number you want, but, it will be set in 0-16
01:46 < Kirbs> but we don't have 32 slots with which to fill players :P
01:46 < Kirbs> unless you're using ddracenetwork's binaries
01:47 < Phobos_>  sv_spectator_slots 16                  sv_max_clients 32
01:47 < Phobos_> works
01:47 < Phobos_> sv_spectator_slots 17                  sv_max_clients 32
01:47 < Kirbs> the standard server can't do that though 
01:47 < rand> yep
01:47 < Phobos_> not works
01:47 < Phobos_> Logic?
01:48 < Kirbs> well yes
01:48 < Kirbs> the standard server can't do 32 players
01:48 < rand> what do you mean by it works ?
01:48 < Kirbs> what are you using?
01:49 < Phobos_> Max is 16?
01:49 < rand> yes
01:50 < Phobos_> sv_maprotation
01:50 < Phobos_> How does it works?
01:50 < Kirbs> sv_maprotation 1stmap 2ndmap 3rdmap etc
01:50 < Kirbs> all based on rounds
01:50 < Kirbs> if you have rounds set to change map after 3 rounds
01:50 < Kirbs> (games played)
01:50 < Kirbs> it will change to a different map after 3 rounds
01:50 < Kirbs> or if 1 round, or.. 0, I think, it will just go by each game
01:51 < Phobos_> thanks
01:51 < Kirbs> not really necessary, to most people
01:51 < Phobos_> How to do and use votes?
01:51 < Kirbs> just to switch it up if you don't have votes
01:51 < Kirbs> add_vote name command
01:52 < Mivel> i keep getting "bam: error: a build step failed" when i try to compile tw ; _;
01:52 < Kirbs> or is that backwards; rand please confirm
01:52 < Kirbs> Mivel, what version?
01:52 < Mivel> the latest release found on the teeworlds site
01:52 < Kirbs> if it's a custom- oh
01:52 < Mivel> and bam 0.4.0
01:52 < rand> add_vote "a sentence describing the vote" command, i confirm
01:52 < Kirbs> if it's a custom build, then things probably aren't set up right, because that happens
01:52 < Kirbs> rand; thank you :)
01:53 < Mivel> figured that, but all the files are fresh out of the zip lol
01:53 < Kirbs> hmm 
01:53 < Kirbs> thats.. odd
01:53 < Kirbs> let me reboot, then you can send me a link
01:53 < Kirbs> I'll see if I can get it to go
01:54 < Phobos_> Example of add_vote, please
01:55 < rand> http://ix.io/o5Y
01:56 < rand> for a dm configuration
01:56 < Kirbs> right aaand
01:56 < rand> http://ix.io/o5Z for ctf
01:56 < rand> and http://ix.io/o60 ( shared_command.cfg )
01:57 < Kirbs> Mivel, link for the source that you were trying to compile?
01:57 < Mivel> https://downloads.teeworlds.com/teeworlds-0.6.3-src.zip
01:58 < Mivel> with this bam https://github.com/downloads/matricks/bam/bam-0.4.0.zip
01:59 < Phobos_> Thanks!
02:00 < rand> Mivel: what is the exact message error ?
02:00 < rand> can you paste it ? (in a pastebin like site )
02:00 < Mivel> 1 sec pastebin is lagging
02:00 < rand> :)
02:00 < Kirbs> build error: a build step failed
02:00 < Kirbs> or something like that
02:00 < Kirbs> its occured with me compiling tdtw
02:00 < Kirbs> but the cause won't be determined without the rest
02:01 < Mivel> http://pastebin.com/vw0yiij0
02:01 < Mivel> says zlib isnt found
02:01 < Phobos_> How to compile and use master-server?
02:04 < Mivel> that was with the "release" option on bam
02:04 < Mivel> also I'm using visual studio 14.0 to compile bam
02:05 < Kirbs> whoaaah
02:05 < Kirbs> you might need someone who actually knows more than a teensy bit about C++
02:05 < Kirbs> I'll try compiling though
02:06 < Kirbs> even if I don't have knowledge of what to do about the errors
02:06 < Mivel> which visual studio do u use to compile yours kirbs?
02:06 < Kirbs> I dont
02:07 < Kirbs> I compile on a linux, which I don't use visual studio with
02:07 < Kirbs> not sure if I'd get different results
02:07 < rand> so do I
02:07 < Mivel> i should just hop on linux and try lol
02:07 < Kirbs> if you have a multiboot, go for it
02:07 < Mivel> yeah I've been meaning to
02:07 < rand> Phobos_: something like bam all
02:07 < Mivel> but I was cross-referencing a bunch of different sourcecodes and didnt want to lose my spot
02:07 < Kirbs> I don't have the capacity to compile with windows, despite my triple boot system having one
02:08 < rand> or bam release
02:08 < Mivel> luckily all my work is on a vcs aylmao
02:08 < rand> I used mingw32 last time I build teeworlds on Win
02:08 < Mivel> ah I'll try that
02:09 < Phobos_> What is versionsrv?
02:09 < rand> good question
02:09 < Mivel> lol when I try using the bam make with mingw, it doesnt find gcc ayyy
02:10 < Mivel> I'ma just try linux real fast brb
02:10 < rand> the server that anwser the last version released
02:10 < rand> (maybe)
02:10 < deen> rand: yes
02:11 < rand> thx
02:14 < rand> in versionsrv.cpp : dbg_msg("mastersrv", "couldn't start network"); … dbg_msg("versionsrv", "started"); :3
02:20 <@heinrich5991> copy pasta
02:22 < Phobos_> thx to all, good bye
02:28 < rand> heinrich5991: :D
02:54 < mivel> alrighty
02:54 < mivel> just spent a little bit setting up linux aylmao
02:58 < mivel> rip rand still got an error lol, i probably forgot to install a library
02:58 < mivel> http://pastebin.com/aprkCCxp
03:00 < rand> the error is expressive
03:00 < rand> sdl is missing
03:00 < mivel> yeah I'm doing "sudo apt-get install libsdl-dev
03:00 < mivel> " atm
03:01 < mivel> libsdl-dev is the right one, right?
03:03 < rand> I guess ^^
03:03 < mivel> thats so weird
03:03 < mivel> there were a few errors but it compiled
03:03 < rand> errors or warning ?
03:04 < mivel> o warnings
03:04 < mivel> well sweet thanks for your help randy <3
03:04 < rand> np
