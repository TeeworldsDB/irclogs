12:38 < heinrich5991> minus: could you redirect https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=CompilingEverything to https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything ?
12:57 <@minus> why
13:01 < heinrich5991> because CompilingEverything was the old link
13:02 <@minus> i can't easily do that, no
13:04 < heinrich5991> mh
13:05 < heinrich5991> removing links is something bad :/
13:05 <@minus> done
13:06 < heinrich5991> wow, nice :)
13:06 <@minus> heinrich5991: you can make a pull request on the docs repo changing back all file names
13:06 <@minus> if you want
13:07 <@minus> otherwise i can hardcode aliases for some
13:07 <@minus> if($_GET["wiki"] == "CompilingEverything") $wiki_page = "compiling_everything";
13:12 < heinrich5991> minus: do you still know the names from before?
13:12 <@minus> compiling everything should be good enough, should it not?
13:15 < heinrich5991> yea I guess
13:16 <@minus> heinrich5991: better make a new website
13:17 <@minus> :D
13:17 < heinrich5991> :)
14:09 < heinrich5991> meh
14:09 < heinrich5991> I dislike this issue closing spree
14:12 < heinrich5991> some things are just closed without a real explanation
14:12 < heinrich5991> issues are hard to discuss once closed, nobody pays attention to them
14:13 < heinrich5991> and then Oy unfortunately isn't reachable via IRC to discuss the issues
14:13 < heinrich5991> so I end up opening the exact same issues as before
14:14 < heinrich5991> (this looks like I'm very annoying.. :/ )
14:14 <@minus> (reopen?)
14:14 < heinrich5991> reopen is only available for people with write access to the repo
14:15 < heinrich5991> (even for my own issues)
16:19 <@minus> heinrich5991 | http://win32builder.gnome.org/packages/3.6/freetype_2.4.11-1_win32.zip ‚Üê did you check if that works?
16:20 < heinrich5991> no
16:20 < heinrich5991> you could ask bear
16:20 < heinrich5991> if it worked
16:20 < heinrich5991> but even that is out of date
16:36 < heinrich5991> minus: why? :)
16:40 <@minus> would be nice to have something working & up2date
16:40  * minus np: Toto - Africa
16:41 < heinrich5991> k
16:48 < Sonix> hi
16:48 <@matricks> sup
16:50 <@minus> ahoi
16:50 < EastByte> ohai
16:52 <@minus> hm, ohai is just ahoi mutated
16:52 < EastByte> oh that's right
16:53 < heinrich5991> ahio
17:31 < Dunedune> where does ohai come from m
17:31 < Dunedune> minus*
17:31 < Dunedune> (hi btw)
17:33 < heinrich5991> I guess from a misspelling of hi (hai) and a combination of that with 'oh'
17:34 < Dunedune> so it would be unrelated to the japanese 'ohayo' standing forr 'hi'?
17:50 <@minus> except ohayou means good morning and not hi
18:17 < Kompl_exe> hey.
18:17 <@matricks> HAI
