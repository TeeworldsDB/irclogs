01:50 < Elise_> XD
01:51 < Elise_> NOW I WILL RELEASE THE XPLOIT THAT CAN DELETE THE SERVERS FROM THE MASTER SERVERS
01:51 < Elise_> XD
01:52 < Elise_> USE IP SPOOFING, USE THE MASTER SERVERS AS THE SOURCE IPs PORT, AND SEND THIS PACKET TO YOUR VICTIM
01:52 < Elise_> "\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff""req2"
01:53 < Elise_> tNO SORRY
01:53 < Elise_> WRONG PACKET SORRY
01:53 < Elise_> THIS IS THE RIGHT PACKET
01:53 < Elise_> "\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff""fwer"
01:53 < Elise_> THE FWERROR PACKET
01:53 < Elise_> I'M THINKING ON TO USE IT ON ALL TEEWORLDS SERVERS
01:54 < Elise_> BUT I WON'T DO IT, I PREFFER TO WAIT UNTIL NOVEMBER 15 2015
01:54 < Elise_> WHEN I WILL START THE DDOS ATTACKS
01:54 < Elise_> :D
01:54 < Elise_> IM THE BEST XD
01:55 < Elise_> BUT I CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT HELP SO, I THINK THAT I WILL RELEASE A WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN DDOS ANY TW SERVER FOR FREE
01:55 < Elise_> JUST KIDDING LOL, I CAN BY MYSELF
01:55 < Elise_> HAHAHHAA
01:56 < Elise_> ANYWAYS VALI WILL RELEASE THAT WEBSITE XD
01:56 < Elise_> Vali
01:56 < Elise_> HIS METHOD DON'T WORKS ON DDNET GER HE SAYS
01:56 < Elise_> BUT MY METHOD IS BETTER AND IT WILL WORK ON DDNET GER
01:57 < Elise_> I THINK YOU WILL CHANGE THE WHOLE TEEWORLDS NETWORK CODE AND YOU WILL MAKE THE GAME TCP ONLY XD
01:57 < Elise_> ?
01:57 < Elise_> XD idk im not a hacker
01:57 < Elise_> im not a good coder XD
01:57 < Elise_> DEEN IS GOOD, EAST IS GOOD
01:57 < Elise_> MINUS IS GOOD , NOT ME xD
01:58 < Elise_> East was who gave me the idea of the ddos method that i will use ;D
01:58 < Elise_> Thanks you East
01:59 < Elise_> You din't it directly, we were talking about how to ddos the mod called iF|City and then he gave me that idea
01:59 < Elise_> he, me, Wolf and FFanta were talking
01:59 < Elise_> FFanta is the owner of iFCity
01:59 < Elise_> GIRLS HERE?
02:00 < Elise_> Who have facebook?
02:00 < Elise_> thi fstd 
02:00 < Elise_> thi*
02:00 < Elise_> hi* lol i think that i am talking in teeworlds then i press T

02:03 < Elise_> YUMMY :F
02:09 < eeeee> poor kid, he really wants some attention
02:10 < Elise_> and the server are strong, are dedicated servers, not VPS
02:10 < Elise_> :P
02:11 < Elise_> Probably in December or in 2016 i stop, i know the girls will make me to stop the ddos attacks
02:11 < Elise_> when they live with me (if i have success abducting them)
02:12 < Elise_> because they can control me with their beauty
02:12 < Elise_> D:
02:12 < Elise_> they can hipnotize me D: the beautiful girls 
02:13 < Elise_> i can't rape the girls :D
02:13 < Elise_> and i don't want to rape them

02:14 < Elise_> but they will live very good
02:14 < Elise_> :D they will be happy
02:14 < Elise_> BYE BYE SEE YOU WHEN I GET THE SPOOFABLES SERVERS
02:53 < Edible> why would you even want to do that?
02:55 < Edible> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvaRGiMWRaE reminds me of this
09:23 <@minus> what a nice morning
09:42 <@matricks> minus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRu_-9MBpd4
09:53 <@minus> :)
09:53 <@minus> pretty much, yeah
10:59 <@minus> deen: don't you think the 220 teeworlds servers DDNet runs is a bit excessive?
11:14 < EastByte> minus: deen isn't administrating ddnet anymore
11:15 < EastByte> we have this amount of servers so anyone can find an empty server to play their wanted map
11:18 <@minus> fair enough
11:18 <@minus> why do you have +m on #ddnet :<
11:19 < Learath2> there was a guy spamming 
11:19 < EastByte> actually only because of the troll/spamer
11:20 <@minus> DDNet running so many servers made mitigating reflection attacks using the masters more difficult
11:26 < EastByte> minus: how do you want to mitigate reflection attacks?
11:26 <@minus> limiting server list requests
11:26 <@minus> per ip
11:27 < EastByte> isn't the purpose of reflection attacks to use spoofed ip addresses?
11:27 < EastByte> you cannot limit requests there
11:27 <@minus> yes, but the spoofed source address is the target, not an arbitrary address
11:28 < Obani> Guys, can I try to make a post on the forum listing some lacks I found on the teeworlds map editor ?
11:28 < EastByte> hm well
11:28 <@minus> mitigation, as i said
11:30 < Learath2> why isnt limiting the rate of server list requests enough ? ddnet servers should just make the list bigger
11:30 < Obani> guys ?
11:34 < EastByte> a simple rate limit would lessen the impact of amplification atleast
11:34 < Obani> ...
11:34 < EastByte> Obani: sorry, for ignoring
11:34 < EastByte> sure you can make a post on tw.com
11:34 <@minus> or you can make a ticket on github, depending on how concrete your suggestions are
11:35 < Obani> minus, this is not concrete enough, that's why I would like to make it on the forum
11:35 < Obani> I'm a Cube2 Engine mapper, and I would like to point what I love on Cube2 that I can't find in teeworlds
11:35 < Obani> matricks, can I use the videos you shared yesterday ?
11:37 <@matricks> for what?
11:38 <@matricks> are you.. are you lubing up?
11:38 < Obani> For the post : interactive particles, custom curves in map editor
11:38 <@matricks> sure
11:38 <@matricks> just download them and host them some where
11:39 < Learath2> :D
11:39 < Obani> easy :p
11:39 < Learath2> i really wanted to give vector based maps a try but was way too hard for me :D
11:40 <@matricks> the particle stuff is in teeworlds now I think
11:40 <@matricks> Learath2: it's kinda a huge redo of a lot of things
11:40 <@matricks> how graphics are made etc
11:40 <@matricks> how collision works
11:40 < Oy> different teeworlds
11:40 <@matricks> yap
11:40 <@matricks> not nessesarly bad, just a different teeworlds
11:41 <@matricks> teeworlds 2
11:41 <@matricks> I've toyed a bit on how to actually make maps for that
11:41 <@matricks> it's... difficult
11:41 < Learath2> yep way too much work for a single person
11:42 <@matricks> going full 3d model seems the easiest code wise, but much harder for artists
11:43 < Obani> yes xD
11:44 <@matricks> and if I would do teeworlds 2.. RUST! rust all the way
11:44 <@matricks> :)
11:45 <@matricks> I think actually rust would help others kinda work on it as well, more safty in the language makes it easier to validate other peoples code
11:45 <@matricks> then again, few people can actually code it so
11:45 <@matricks> but then again, most people can't code c++ well so
11:46 <@matricks> everytime I've seen someone wanna do a pull request with some threading in it, I screem with horror and go and hide under my bed
11:46 < Learath2> i just cant wrap my head around the rust syntax
11:46 <@matricks> Learath2: the syntax isn't that hard, its more the lifetime and pointer handling that fucks with your head in the beginning
11:47 <@matricks> the c++ syntax is way worse
11:47 <@matricks> in all the different forms it can take...
12:07 < Obani> Well, I didn't write my post for now... I just did this reply https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=116255#p116255
12:23 < Oy> this thread should probably be closed
12:24 < Obani> Why ?
12:25 < Obani> 0.7 is going to be released soon ?
12:29 < Oy> there is already more than enough work todo
12:30 < Obani> It's just a bunch of ideas
12:31 <@minus> Oy: got a roadmap?
12:33 < Oy> minus: the tickets on github
12:33 <@minus> are some of them assigned to 0.7?
12:33 < Obani> the 138 issues ?
12:33 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.7.0
12:34 < Oy> though i'm not 100% sure they're all accurate
12:35 < Obani> also, were pull requests forgotten ?
12:37 < Oy> not really, though a few have to be reworked, or i have to think what todo there
12:38 < Obani> Well, for red stars, we need an artist :p
12:38 <@minus> 60 issues, doens't seem so bad
12:39 <@minus> uh, ipv6 is still amongst them
12:44 <@matricks> some of them should probably be postponed
12:44 < Oy> yeah and some aren't in the milestone yet, though they should be
12:45 <@matricks> server wait queue -> future release
12:45 <@matricks> new game mode -> future release if it isn't ready
12:46 <@matricks> quickstart page -> future release
12:47 <@matricks> oh well
12:52 <@matricks> minus: nice work on the documentation stuff
12:53 < Obani> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=116257#p116257
12:54 <@minus> matricks: well, i had procrastinated on that for years
12:57 < xush> Hey
12:57 < EastByte> hello xush 
12:57 <@minus> greetings
12:58 < Obani> yo
12:58 < xush> Is there a 0.7 equivalent to GetPos()?
12:58 < xush> GetDir(), sorry.
13:00 < Oy> minus: dunno how much longer the download links for bam will work (f.e. http://github.com/downloads/matricks/bam/bam-0.4.0.zip)
13:01 <@minus> oh right, they deprecated those
13:01 <@minus> matricks: make releases for bam on github :)
13:02 < Oy> yeah, they gonna remove them someday
13:04 < Obani> Who is zatline ?

13:17 <@minus> do 0.4 now
13:17 <@matricks> sorry, have more urgent code work that needs to be done
13:22 < xush> thanks a lot rand, i was about to use sinf and cosf!
13:31 < Obani> Sonix-, I began a new map
13:34 < Sonix-> Hi Oy , hi guys :)
13:34 < Sonix-> Obani: nice :)
13:34  * matricks codes some php
13:35  * matricks feels a bit dirty
13:35 <@matricks> should take a shower
13:35 < Obani> be careful matricks 
13:35 < Obani> I just took a shower
13:35 < Obani> And I found 3 electrodes on my body
13:36 <@matricks> O.o
13:36 < Obani> true story
13:36 < Obani> It was my first shower since I got operated :x
13:36 <@matricks> ahh
13:37 <@matricks> what did you do?
13:37 <@matricks> I had an operation 6w ago
13:37 < Obani> I lost 4 teeth
13:37 <@matricks> ouch, what happend?
13:37 < Obani> no I mean those teeth were attacking other ones :p
13:38 < Obani> I had to remove them
13:38 <@matricks> oh
13:38 <@matricks> and you had to do it with an operation?
13:38 <@matricks> that sucks
13:38 < Obani> yes
13:38 <@matricks> actually, I might need some dental surgery as well, gonna findout next week
13:39 <@matricks> and my wrist operated on 6 weeks ago as well
13:40 < Oy> another one?
13:40 <@matricks> only had one operation, and that was 6w ago
13:40 < Oy> yeah thought that fixed everything
13:40 <@matricks> yap, the dental stuff is unrelated
13:41 < Oy> ah ok
13:42 <@matricks> had braces for like a year now to fix my fucked up teeth :)
13:43 <@matricks> had to get em, I started to eat my own teeth
13:43 < Oy> oh
13:52 < Obani> Sonix-, I sent you a PM
13:53 <@minus> Obani: wisdom teeth?
13:53 < Obani> afk
13:53 < Obani> minus, yes
13:53 < Obani> afk
13:53 <@minus> had the same done this spring
13:53 < Oy> matricks: would be good if you could tag this https://github.com/matricks/bam/commit/4bffc62aa4bb184dfcd338d15d63903e561dcbed as 0.4 release ;)
13:55 <@minus> ^ rest is automagical
13:57 < Oy> Sonix-: how is the map thing going?
15:43 < Sonix-> Oy: I gotta speed up some progress although it's not simple and feeling pretty lonely :P but I've done some progress and will do some more in the next months 
15:54 < Oy> Sonix-: that's good :)
15:54 < Oy> maybe you find someone who can help you
15:54 < Oy> magnet still around?
16:01 < Obani> Sonix-, are you talking about maps ?
