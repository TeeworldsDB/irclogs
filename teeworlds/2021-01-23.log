18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I experienced a similar issue like the one above some months ago on a vanilla server. Most clients crashed at the same time. The demo just ends at this point. Nothing special in there =\
18:14 < Oy> did your client crash too? do you still have the demo?
18:17 < seabass> Hello! I'm the seabass in question
18:17 < seabass> I didn't have auto demo saving on when it happened
18:17 < seabass> It's interesting to see that it's not an isolated event
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Yeah my client crashed as well. Not sure whether I still have the demo, but it seems like the client crashed before it saved the last snapshot.
