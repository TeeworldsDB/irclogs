00:18 < Pathos> Quick question: I have build-essentials installed, but bam.lua still won't compiled when I run bam server_release command, saying that I don't have c/c++ compiler found. What gives? Ubuntu 15
00:21 < Pathos> Nevermind
18:18 < bigman> Hi all
18:18 < bigman> I have written following code in controls.cpp
18:18 < bigman> 		Graphics()->TextureSet(-1); 		Graphics()->LinesBegin(); 		Graphics()->SetColor(1.00f, 0.00f, 0.00f, 1.00f); 		IGraphics::CLineItem LineItem(targetPos.x - 90, targetPos.y - 90, targetPos.x + 90, targetPos.y + 90); 		Graphics()->LinesDraw(&LineItem, 1); 		Graphics()->LinesEnd();
18:19 < bigman> also i included graphics.h
18:19 < bigman> but this code not works
18:19 < bigman> any one can helps ?
18:19 <@matricks> what happens?
18:19 < bigman> nothing
18:19 <@matricks> is the targetPos inside the screen?
18:20 < bigman> yes im sure about that
18:20 <@matricks> is the code executed?
18:20 < bigman> when i insert the code in players,cpp that works
18:20 <@matricks> so are you drawing in world space or screen space?
18:21 < bigman> i dont know the diff
18:21 < bigman> :D
18:21 <@matricks> well, probably your problem then :D
18:21 <@matricks> in world space [ 0, 0 ] is at the top left corner of the map
18:21 < bigman> i must tell the client ? how ?
18:22 <@matricks> in screen space, [ 0, 0 ] is at the top left of the screen
18:22 <@matricks> which codebase are you on>?
18:22 < bigman> i used exact same code to get the targetPos in both players ans controls
18:22 <@matricks> 0.6?
18:22 < bigman> no ddnet
18:22 <@matricks> then dunno
18:24 < bigman> targetPos = vec2(m_pClient->m_Snap.m_aCharacters[i].m_Cur.m_X, m_pClient->m_Snap.m_aCharacters[i].m_Cur.m_Y);
18:24 <@matricks> so you wanna render stuff in world space
18:24 < bigman> yes i think
18:25 <@matricks> well, then you can't do it in controls
18:25 < bigman> what if i create my own component
18:26 <@matricks> then you can insert it in the proper render order as well
18:26 <@matricks> anything controls render, will be discarded due to that a lot will render above it
18:26 < bigman> hmm thanks!
18:27 < bigman> but one more question
18:27 <@matricks> no
18:27 < bigman> i used graphics.h
18:27 <@matricks> only one question per user
18:27 < bigman> :D
18:27 < bigman> ok thanks
18:27 <@matricks> what about it?
18:28 < bigman> wanted to say when i included this file why the order of loading modules takes effect
