11:41 < MertenNor> heinrich5991: I can test for Windows and OSX
11:42 < MertenNor> got different versions of OSX around the house.. so I can test on different versions.. 
11:44 < MertenNor> heinrich5991: sent you a PM via the forum with the info
11:53 < Dunedune> MertenNor the eternal OSX tester
11:55 < Dunedune> heinrich5991: does it use the same config file as usual Teeworlds?
12:06 < MertenNor> :D
12:12 < MertenNor> the DL servers for TW on Steam is really slow xD
12:12 < Dunedune> yes, very
12:15 < MertenNor> booting over to mac.. 
12:15 < MertenNor> brb
12:22 < MertenNor> heinrich5991: its not launching on OSX 10.9.4
12:22 < MertenNor> I can try on a different os version if you want.. 
12:23 < MertenNor> heinrich5991: here: http://pastie.org/10250049
12:24 < MertenNor> do I need libfreetype ? 
12:25 < MertenNor> hm its already installed.. idk then..
12:27 < MertenNor_> Test
12:33 < MertenNor_> Downloading on 10.9.5
12:34 < MertenNor_> That 50kb Speed! :p
12:36 < MertenNor_> heinrich5991: I still get the same error
12:36 < MertenNor_> :/
12:41 < MertenNor> heinrich5991: solved it.. 
12:41 < MertenNor> looks like its not creating the app data file for teeworlds
12:41 < MertenNor> it works when its there.. 
12:43 < MertenNor> might be the same for windows.. 
12:43 < MertenNor> Booting over to windows.. 
12:47 < MertenNor> nope not the same for windows.. 
23:42 < MertenNor> hi
23:43 < MertenNor> heinrich5991: did you see what I said about the mac version ?
23:44 < heinrich5991> MertenNor: yea, thanks for testing it
23:44 < heinrich5991> I can't derive something I can do though :/
23:44 < MertenNor> np did you fix it ?
23:44 < MertenNor> ?
23:45 < heinrich5991> mh. you say teeworlds doesn't/can't create its appdata directory
23:45 < heinrich5991> but â€“ that's pretty much what it does on startup
23:45 < MertenNor> yeah but it looks like its not creating it.. 
23:46 < MertenNor> I renamed my old teeworlds appdata folder on mac before installing it.. 
23:46 < MertenNor> and tried to start the game but it dident work..
23:47 < MertenNor> then I renamed the appdata folder back then it worked.
23:56 < heinrich5991> mh
23:56 < heinrich5991> and I should probably also bundle freetype or so
23:56 < heinrich5991> the first error message said something about that
