11:02 < SoMeRelaX> which port is open for irc ? i want connect to irc channel #teeworlds with game client help me plz
11:06 < heinrich5991> SoMeRelaX: irc.quakenet.org, port 6667, channel #teeworlds
11:07 < SoMeRelaX> port 6667 is closed
11:07 < SoMeRelaX> check http://ping.eu/port-chk/
11:10 < SoMeRelaX> heinrich5991: i add irc.quakenet.org, port 6667, channel #teeworlds in gamer client but didnt happend
11:11 < heinrich5991> SoMeRelaX: I can connect to irc.quakenet.org port 6667
11:12 < heinrich5991> SoMeRelaX: the site also says that port 6667 is open on irc.quakenet.org
11:12 < SoMeRelaX> heinrich5991: im with Gamer Clietn when i set this setting in client how i can connect to server ?
11:12 < heinrich5991> I have no idea
11:12 < heinrich5991> I haven't used the IRC feature of the gamer client
11:12 < SoMeRelaX> ok tnx heinrich5991 
11:26 <@minus> this one class i have, computational geometry, has great puzzles for homework
11:38 < heinrich5991> komputationale geometrie
11:39 <@minus> algorithmische geometrie is the german term
11:53 <@minus> heinrich5991: o(nlogn) (small o, not big O) means linear, right?
11:55 < heinrich5991> I believe it means: if f in o(g), then lim n to infinity of f(x)/g(x) = 0
11:55 < heinrich5991> so, "o" contains all functions that grow much slower than the specified one
11:56 <@minus> yes
11:56 <@minus> so it must be linear at most
11:56 <@minus> or well, anything <nlogn
11:58 < heinrich5991> n*loglog(n)
11:58 < heinrich5991> should be in there as well
11:59 <@minus> yeah
11:59 <@minus> but where are you ever gonna get that
12:03 <@minus> wanna see the problems i got to solve?
12:04 <@minus> help me solve them :D
12:24 < heinrich5991> minus: what's the problem?
12:35 <@minus> no PM, please
12:36 <@minus> hm, is there no topic
13:46 < lamefun> Stand up to Medusa Gorgon! Play custom maps!
15:39 < kosho> hi
