07:21 <@matricks> second guy that asks for a steam key...
07:22 <@matricks> and someone else should get these messages
08:50 <@minus> matricks: i can redirect them to /dev/null if you want
08:51 <@matricks> minus: yeah, but that guy is getting full
08:51 <@matricks> too many people redirecting to there
09:49 <@matricks> 3 people
12:15 < ghost91> hey guys
12:16 <@matricks> HAI!
12:18 < ghost91> what's up?
12:19 <@matricks> work
12:27 < Feels> oink
14:36 < rand> heinrich5991: sandsnake asked me to borrow you some bots for the survival ctf mod
14:36 < heinrich5991> interesting :)
14:36 < rand> i can send some bots on your server if you want
14:37 < heinrich5991> I'd need to modify the source code first, but then, sure, why not :)
14:38 < rand> ok, hl me whenever you want :)
14:38 < EastByte> survival ctf?
14:39 < rand> ctf without respawn until next capture (or everyone die)
14:39 < heinrich5991> EastByte: the mod you recently played
14:39 < EastByte> ah
19:40 < Fels> oink
19:40 < Henningstone> xD
19:41 < Savander> kwa
20:33 <@minus> no topic set?
20:34 <@minus> fyi: looking for master server hosters
20:40 <@minus> o/
20:41 < jxsl13> \o
20:41 < SirCmpwn_> o/
20:41 <@matricks> \o/
20:42 < Henningstone> >.>
20:43 < jxsl13> <.<
21:00 < EastByte> SirCmpwn_: hi
21:01 < EastByte> aren't you the dev of knightos?
21:03 <@minus> he is
21:03 < WolfAlex> minus: i could host a master :E EastByte is also moderating my dedi
21:04 < EastByte> 1gbit ovh dedicated server
21:04 < EastByte> iirc another master server is at ovh?
21:04 <@minus> nope
21:04 <@minus> oh wait
21:05 <@minus> you're right
21:05 < WolfAlex> hm :/
21:05 < EastByte> I think you switched due to ddos attacks
21:05 <@minus> yep
21:05 <@minus> that was 2 years ago though, no attacks since then
21:05 <@minus> or at least none i noticed
21:06 <@minus> should set up smokeping to monitor latency
21:09 < WolfAlex> EastByte: minus: what location is the other server?
21:09 < EastByte> whois tells me Roubaix
21:09 < WolfAlex> my dedi is atm. at stb2 if i remember correct, but i want to test gra1 again (because of more stable ping)
21:10 < EastByte> sbg not stb :p
21:10 < WolfAlex> SBG2 sry :/
21:12 <@minus> i'll look into things
21:25 < WolfAlex> minus: how are the masterbans synced?
21:25 <@minus> there's a cronjob downloading them every 30 minutes :D
21:26 < SirCmpwn_> hi EastByte, yes
21:26 < WolfAlex> okay, what if the server that hosts the list is down? all bans removed or no changes? :D minus 
21:26 <@minus> no changes
21:36 <@minus> BotoX: do you still actively maintain your server status thingie? you should throw websockets at it
21:43 < jxsl13> nick changed like a Sir.
21:52 < BotoX> why websockets lel
21:52 < BotoX> also nah I don't update it anymore really
21:52 < BotoX> it runs fine as it is though I don't like how I made it
21:53 < BotoX> (I just wanted to fix the existing serverstatus script - then I realized it's crap and rewrote it and it came out to be less crap but still too complicated)
21:53 < BotoX> Ideally it'd just be one server that you would give a ssh key and setup accounts on your servers
21:54 < BotoX> Also I have access to a bunch of servers from HorribleSubs, if you'd want a master hosted on them ^^
21:54 < BotoX> Can't guarantee for uptime though, so probably not so good for a master
22:02 < deen> BotoX: I'm still running ServerStatus, it's pretty nice
22:02 < BotoX> yeah once you set it up it does the job
22:02 < BotoX> but setting it up is kind of a pain
22:03 < BotoX> pick one minus: Nagi no Asakura, Selector infected WIXOSS, Ghost in the Shell Arise, Psycho-Pass, No Game No Life or Toradora
22:04 <@minus> wixoss, haven't seen that one
22:04 < BotoX> Does that mean you have seen all the others :o
22:04 <@minus> ..
22:04 <@minus> ^ wrong window
22:04 < BotoX> lel
22:04 <@minus> actually i haven't seen arise
22:05 < BotoX> What about the ones you have seen, any omfgz must sees
22:06 <@minus> nagi no asukara is melodrama, no game no life is pretty cool but is incomplete, psycho-pass is great and you should watch it
22:07 < BotoX> Guess it will be psycho-pass since I have that HDD inserted right now :D
22:07 <@minus> toradora is intense drama too iirc (been a long time)
22:07 < BotoX> Watched Ga-Rei Zero yesterday, damn son.
22:07 <@minus> i keep on forgetting how that ended
22:08 < jxsl13> animes are evil :O read mangas instead
22:08 < BotoX> oh rip no colors in this channel
22:09 < BotoX> Also I watched Shiki a few days ago
22:09 < BotoX> I had to cry at the end ;_;
22:09 < BotoX> Hardest thing I ever watched
22:10 <@minus> hey, that's the first time i compiled the mastersrv after the new build config got merged, looks so sleek: ../bam/bam -j $(nproc) conf=release masterserver
22:10 < BotoX> before you had to compile all?
22:10 < BotoX> or was it tools, idk
22:10 <@minus> no, you just had to `bam mastersrv`
22:11 <@minus> and add a _d for debug
22:11 < BotoX> -d would've been better as a parameter
22:11 < BotoX> instead of conf=release or conf=debug (guessing?)
22:11 <@minus> that would've been a switch for bam
22:12 < BotoX> yeah
22:12 <@minus> whatever
22:12 <@minus> i think i need to patch some logging out of the master
22:12 < BotoX> idk conf=release seems kind of long, but I am guessing it is the default?
22:12 <@minus> dunno, probably
22:13 <@minus> lol, mastersrv on one master writes a log file. apparently i gz-compress it: -rw-r--r-- 1 twmaster twmaster  11G Aug 26 22:14 log.gz
22:14 < BotoX> damn
22:14 < BotoX> is that like every request on it
22:14 < BotoX> nice spying minus :v
22:26 <@minus> decompressed the file
22:26 <@minus> 108G :D
22:30 <@minus> Mr-Anderson: ^ that's how much log output the master on your machine made :D
22:30 < Mr-Anderson> :D
22:30 < Mr-Anderson> holy, 108G?
22:30 <@minus> compressed to 11G
22:31 < Mr-Anderson> that compression :D
22:31 <@minus> well, it's the same text repeating over and over again
22:31 <@minus> i'm copying the file, for analysis purposes
22:34 < BotoX> please stop feeding the NSA data mate
22:35 <@minus> 3MB/s, what a bad bandwidth
22:38 < BotoX> psycho-pass looks really cool already
22:38 <@matricks> lol
