18:22 < YoungFlyme> Hey hoo guys, i just found a pice of code which i dont understand. Maby some one of you can help me ^^. What does this "int End(Distance+1);" exactly do? (found in src/game/collision.cpp)
18:29 < deen> YoungFlyme: same as int End = Distance + 1;
18:30 < YoungFlyme> Ahh ok, thanks deen ^^
18:30 < deen> Creates a new variable of type int with identifier End and assigns the value of the calculation "Distance + 1" to it, where Distance refers to another variable, 1 a constant the plus operator. The calculation will be done with floats and then cast to int
18:31 < YoungFlyme> yeah, because the use this for the limit of the "for-loop" ^^
18:31 < YoungFlyme> they*
18:34 < deen> fyi, C++11 also supports list initialization  "int End{Distance +1};"
18:37 < YoungFlyme> ok o.O looks complicated xD
19:45 < eeeee> c++ devs need job security too, gotta pump up that standard
