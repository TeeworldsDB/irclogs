15:10 < violet-ta> hello
15:10 <@heinrich5991> hi!
15:11 < violet-ta> it seems i can't send anything to #teeworlds-dev. Does anybody know, why?
15:12 <@heinrich5991> yes, the channel is closed
15:12 <@heinrich5991> talk here :)
15:15 < violet-ta> i wanted to build teeworlds and instruction on official site says I need visual studio 9.0. Is it info relevant?
15:17 < violet-ta> it seems like microsoft no longer gives it, I only can download sdk 7
15:21 <@heinrich5991> violet-ta: you can download newer versions of visual c++
15:26 < violet-ta> in fact, then i try to compile bam 0.4 it says I need vs 8,9 or 10
15:32 <@heinrich5991> violet-ta: try this version of bam: https://github.com/matricks/bam/archive/afbcf398c5e8261c563cec8ae2f31214a764eeea.zip
15:34 < violet-ta> now the list is expanded to 11 and 12
15:34 < violet-ta> and i have 15 :)
15:36 <@heinrich5991> violet-ta: I'm not sure, but maybe the 15 isn't the actual version number
15:36 <@heinrich5991> have you tried executing it?
15:37 < violet-ta> vs 2015, seems like actual number is 14
15:37 < violet-ta> i can install vs express 12
15:38 < violet-ta> maybe
15:39 <@heinrich5991> I'm sorry that it doesn't work so easily
15:40 < violet-ta> omg express version 3.5 g
15:40 < violet-ta> gb
15:40 <@heinrich5991> if exist "%VS140COMNTOOLS%" (
15:40 <@heinrich5991>     set VSPATH="%VS140COMNTOOLS%"
15:40 <@heinrich5991>     goto set_env
15:40 <@heinrich5991> )
15:40 <@heinrich5991> could you add that to the make_win32_msvc.bat?
15:41 <@heinrich5991> to the similar looking code
15:41 < violet-ta> ok
15:42 < violet-ta> now it does something
15:42 < violet-ta> but nothing writes
15:42 < violet-ta> now compiles
15:43 < violet-ta> seems all ok
15:44 < violet-ta> now I need to get teeworlds from github?
15:46 <@heinrich5991> violet-ta: that's the next step to compile teeworlds, yes
15:47 < violet-ta> what does this? 
15:47 < violet-ta> %comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" x86
15:49 < violet-ta> instruction is somewhat unclear
15:52 <@heinrich5991> I believe it just executes the batch file with x86 as parameter
15:52 <@heinrich5991> like
15:52 <@heinrich5991> vcvarsall.bat x86
15:52 < violet-ta> then goes
15:52 < violet-ta> cd teeworlds-version-src   ..\bam\bam
15:53 <@heinrich5991> what are you trying to do?
15:53 < violet-ta> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything
15:53 < violet-ta> it's the only instruction I found :)
15:53 <@heinrich5991> meh
15:54 <@heinrich5991> ok. open msvc++, and go to tools -> open command line
15:54 <@heinrich5991> then navigate to the teeworlds source
15:54 <@heinrich5991> and execute bam, with the correct path
15:55 < violet-ta> hmm
15:56 < violet-ta> after i executed that .bat even the new command promt is busy
15:57 <@heinrich5991> I doubt you even have that bat
15:57 <@heinrich5991> because you don't have Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0, right?
15:57 < violet-ta> oh, no, my bad
15:57 < violet-ta> I changed version
15:57 < violet-ta> but it's not related
15:59 < violet-ta> I need to execute bam.lua?
15:59 < violet-ta> because I unzipped bam in other location
16:00 <@heinrich5991> the first step has produced a bam.exe
16:00 < violet-ta> yes
16:00 <@heinrich5991> you need to execute that while being in the teeworlds directory
16:00 <@heinrich5991> in the command line opened from visual studio
16:00 < violet-ta> now understand
16:02 < violet-ta> something is doing
16:03 < violet-ta> [679/680] [1] copy datasrc/skins/x_ninja.json -> build/x86/debug/data/skins/x_ninja.json bam: error: a build step failed
16:04 <@minus> that looks odd
16:04 <@minus> (that assets get copied into the build dir)
16:04 <@minus> not sure if that even works
16:05 < violet-ta> how do you guys actually work with it? :)
16:06  * minus doesn't
16:07 <@heinrich5991> violet-ta: well, unfortunately we don't really have a dev on windows, nobody is really updating the docs, etc., everything is falling apart :/
16:07 <@heinrich5991> violet-ta: execute bam again and tell us which build step failed
16:08 < violet-ta> now I have other error
16:08 < violet-ta> src/engine/client/input.cpp(3): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'SDL.h': No such file or directory
16:15 <@heinrich5991> ah right :/
16:16 <@heinrich5991> oy removed the header files
16:17 <@heinrich5991> violet-ta: are you compiling the master version or the 0.6 version?
16:18 <@heinrich5991> violet-ta: how have you gotten the source code?
16:21 < violet-ta> I assume master
16:21 <@heinrich5991> violet-ta: unzip https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.4.zip so that you have other/sdl/include
16:22 < violet-ta> also this:     src/engine/client/text.cpp(13): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'ft2build.h': No such file or directory
16:22 < violet-ta> where to unzip?
16:23 <@heinrich5991> unzip it somewhere, and copy the include/ directory to other/sdl/
16:23 <@heinrich5991> violet-ta: have you fetched the teeworlds source code with git?
16:24 < violet-ta> I downloaded it using windows github app
16:24 <@heinrich5991> ok
16:25 < violet-ta> now the second error is still there
16:25 < violet-ta> and
16:25 < violet-ta> src/engine/client/backend_sdl.cpp(17): error C2365: 'glTexImage3D': redefinition; previous definition was 'function'
16:25 < violet-ta> src/engine/client/backend_sdl.cpp(733): error C2659: '=': function as left operand
16:25 <@heinrich5991> type bam -c config
16:25 <@heinrich5991> and then bam again
16:26 <@heinrich5991> and then we'll fix the second error
16:26 < violet-ta> no, it still there
16:26 < violet-ta> ft2build
16:27 <@heinrich5991> yes, that error is still unfixed
16:27 <@heinrich5991> but the others should be gone?
16:27 < violet-ta> no, it all the same
16:28 <@heinrich5991> aha
16:28 <@heinrich5991> :(
16:28 <@heinrich5991> well, freetype can be downloaded here: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/freetype-bin-zip.php
16:29 < violet-ta> and?
16:30 <@heinrich5991> move the contents of the include/freetype2/freetype/ to other/freetype/include/
16:31 < violet-ta> error is there (and i don't see ft2build.h anythere)
16:33 < violet-ta> it is in fact in include of freetype
16:33 < violet-ta> in root include
16:33 <@heinrich5991> you're right, that's not useful
16:34 < violet-ta> i copied it too
16:34 < violet-ta> but now another file
16:35 < violet-ta> now ft2build can't open something because it itself in wrong dir
16:35 <@heinrich5991> mh
16:37 <@heinrich5991> ok.
16:37 < violet-ta> oh
16:38 <@heinrich5991> violet-ta: remove the freetype folder again, download this older version of teeworlds and use copy the freetype directory from there: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/archive/0.6.zip
16:38 <@heinrich5991> oh?
16:38 < violet-ta> after some intuition did work it found all files
16:38 <@heinrich5991> (sdl version from there won't work)
16:38 <@heinrich5991> ok
16:38 < violet-ta> now remain errors in cpp
16:38 < violet-ta> no
16:38 < violet-ta> in .h
16:39 < violet-ta> and in cpp
16:39 <@heinrich5991> I don't know why there are still errors
16:39 < violet-ta> E:\develop\github\teeworlds\src\base/tl/threading.h(38): warning C4005: 'WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN': macro redefinition
16:39 <@heinrich5991> that's a warning, no problem
16:39 < violet-ta> E:\develop\github\teeworlds\other\sdl\include\SDL_opengl.h(115): note: see previous definition of 'WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN'
16:39 < violet-ta> src/engine/client/backend_sdl.cpp(17): error C2365: 'glTexImage3D': redefinition; previous definition was 'function'
16:40 < violet-ta> E:\develop\github\teeworlds\other\sdl\include\SDL_opengl.h(1544): note: see declaration of 'glTexImage3D'
16:40 < violet-ta> src/engine/client/backend_sdl.cpp(733): error C2659: '=': function as left operand
16:40 < violet-ta> that's all
16:40 <@heinrich5991> yea, sounds like an sdl error
16:41 <@heinrich5991> I don't know how to fix that right now, and I have to go
16:41 < violet-ta> ok
16:41 <@heinrich5991> I'll be here tomorrow again.
16:41 < violet-ta> thanks for help :)
16:42 <@heinrich5991> you're welcome. we should really work on the ease of the compilation on windows :(
16:42 < violet-ta> at what time are you usually here?
16:44 <@heinrich5991> should be here around 11:00 UTC: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2016-06-24+11:00+UTC
16:44 <@heinrich5991> that's 13:00 if you happen to live in central europe
17:08 < Obani> Hey
17:08 < Obani> Why did the channel turned to +r ?
17:08 < EastByte> because trolls
17:08 < Obani> Or is it quakenet ?
17:08 < Obani> Oh
17:08 < Obani> I wanted to ask something especially to server owners
17:09 < Obani> Is there a non-hacky way to make blank spaces in the "votes" section ?
17:09 < Obani> And if it's a hacky way, how to make it work ? I tried this :
17:10 < Obani> add_vote " " "warmup 0" # This option is never changed, it's a hack
17:10 < Obani> But it didn't work
17:11 < Obani> And it seems like if several votes have the same name/description, only the first will be displayed
17:11 < Obani> If you have an answer, please ping me :)
17:12 < EastByte> you can take a look at https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps/blob/master/types/moderate/votes.cfg
17:13 < EastByte> looks like there the number of spaces increases on each gap
17:13 < Obani> EastByte, thanks for the quick answer
17:13 < Obani> EastByte, I think the "info" label is the one doing this
17:13 < EastByte> I guess there is no less hacky way to do it"
17:14 < EastByte> not sure what info does or whether it even is part of vanilla teeworlds
17:14 < Obani> gonna try atm
17:14 < Obani> If it works with normal openfng, it might be in vabilla
17:15 < Obani> vanilla*
17:15 < EastByte> Obani: it's a ddnet related thing
17:15 < EastByte> a cmd that doesn't do anything
17:16 < Obani> indeed
17:19 < EastByte> well, putting gaps into the votelist is a hack anyways :p
17:19 < Obani> EastByte, yes, but I didn't find any working hack for gaps in vanilla
17:19 < Obani> Space character seems to be ignored
17:21 < EastByte> I see
17:23 < Obani> I need to use "_"
17:23 < Obani> sad I am
17:40 < EastByte> Obani: well you can still use some unicode gap, like this one: " "
17:50 <@minus> or "​" (zero-width space)
17:53 < Obani> EastByte, it works !
17:55 < EastByte> I should have noticed that ddnet uses unicode hacks aswell
