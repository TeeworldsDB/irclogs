19:31 < slinacK> hey there :) just a quick question... I noticed that it's not possible in 0.7 to change teams through f1 > "team 0/1/-1"
19:31 < slinacK> then I guess it won't be possible anymore to change teams through binds, but only via HUD?
19:38 <@heinrich5991> I don't know
20:02 < slinacK> It's pretty much in this commit: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/d8d259a1663a6c47bd703b071dd798d6535e45ae
