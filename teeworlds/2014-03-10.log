18:55 < Maimer> 404
18:55 <@matricks> well, that went quick
18:56 < Maimer> lol
18:56 <@minus> TIL matricks browses 4chan
18:56 < BotoX> :o
18:56 <@matricks> I drop in now and then
18:57 < Maimer> matricks can you recommend any resources for learning game specific programming in C++?
18:57 < Maimer> any books or anything?
18:57 <@matricks> I havn't read that much
18:57 < Maimer> how did oyu learn
18:57 <@matricks> I've read like one book
18:58 <@matricks> Maimer: by doing
18:58 < Maimer> well how did you do without knowing what to do
18:58 < Maimer> you must have had resources
18:58 < Maimer> people to talk to
18:58 <@minus> Effective C++ seems like a nice series of books
18:58 < Maimer> source code to look at
18:58 <@matricks> Maimer: well, not that much
18:59 <@minus> though not about game programming. as the name says, about efficiency
19:00 < Maimer> well where did you even learn the basics of the language?
19:00 < Maimer> like syntax and what not
19:00 < Maimer> and dont say by doing
19:00 <@matricks> well, the compiler tells you :)
19:00 <@matricks> and I had some few articles etc
19:00 <@minus> well, the syntax is the /least/ of your problems
19:00 <@matricks> example code
19:00 < Maimer> what did you program teeworlds in?
19:01 < Maimer> did you use an IDE?
19:02 <@matricks> Maimer: I don't use IDEs
19:02 <@matricks> editor + commandline more or less
19:02 <@minus> 'cause matricks is batshit crazy
19:02 < Maimer> thats what I have been using thus far
19:02 < Learath2> well IDEs are overrated
19:02 < Maimer> but its not fun when your command line pumps out 1000 errors at once
19:02 <@matricks> what I do miss is a good debugger however
19:02 < Maimer> and then you ahve to scroll up forever to realize you missed a semicolon
19:03 <@matricks> Maimer: I compile from the ditor
19:03 < Learath2> matricks: werent you making your own debugger ?
19:03 <@matricks> editor
19:03 < Maimer> what editor do you use?
19:03 <@matricks> Learath2: yah
19:03 <@matricks> Maimer: sublime at the moment
19:03 < Maimer> thats what I use
19:03 < Maimer> I didnt know you could compile from there
19:03 <@minus> 2 or 3
19:03 <@matricks> minus: 2
19:03 <@minus> make a makefile and hit ctrl-b
19:03 < Maimer> I use 2, you?
19:03 <@minus> 2 2
19:04 < BotoX> 3
19:04 < BotoX> Sublime Text Build 3059
19:06 < BotoX> https://github.com/BotoX/ServerStatus/blob/master/default.sublime-project
19:06 < BotoX> sublimegdb is still buggy :(
19:08 < EastBite> JulianAssange: I won't release anything >:D
19:12 < BotoX> http://www.independent.co.uk/news/weird-news/man-stabbed-with-legend-of-zelda-master-sword-in-serious-condition-9167520.html
19:12 < BotoX> >Pots were also smashed during altercation
19:14 <@minus> only in texas
19:38 < heinrich5991> EastBite: release what?
19:47 < EastBite> heinrich5991: a private teeworlds related project going nowhere
19:47 <@minus> nice summary
19:49 < EastBite> basicly a teeworlds bouncer usable for hijacking player sessions
19:51 < EastBite> client and server source mixed together
19:51 < EastBite> better summary? :)
19:53 < Learath2> why you hijack player sessions ?
19:54 < EastBite> I do not, it's just an example of usability
20:49 < ***> Buffer Playback...
20:49 < EastBite> [20:09:07] that moment when you accidently type rm instead of mplayer
20:49 < EastBite> [20:09:22] maybe I should -w my media files
20:49 < ***> Playback Complete.
