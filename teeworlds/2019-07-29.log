03:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> after about 10+ hours of looking for a solution, I might as well ask in here, what's causing this to die at runtime. https://github.com/jxsl13/redis_test.
13:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Seems like menus.h is including graphics.h and all the menu cpp files like menus_browser.cpp menus_settings.cpp include menus.h and graphics.h is this needed? Or is it to improve readability?
13:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> You could trim a lot of headers in most projects
13:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> But since menus_***.cpp need graphics and menus.h does too, meh
13:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I'd say to leave it
13:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so it is required to ensure compiling success?
13:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> nah you could probably remove it in the .cpp files, but I'd leave it
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> TeeSlayer, can you change the map of one of the block server to the "multimap"? Guess that would be the best option
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> reading tw code is fun i didnt know gfx_clear is a thing now

22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe that could activate automatically if there is no bg quad or hd is off and the bg quad is hd
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> because everybody will ragequit on those maps instead of searching this feature xd
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> no map should rely on gfx_clear anyway
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ya true was thinking about it. Probably we shouldn encurage bad mapping styles
22:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But good to know there is this fix if i play on a buggo map again ðŸ˜ƒ
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> - add option to automap maps in grass_style - like in gamer client
