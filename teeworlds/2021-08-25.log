16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 91.10.52.220:8312 faking my server
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thats vali's ip
16:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> He is trying to steal account/rcon data via a proxy
16:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i think its more like he is just trying to grab ips to make people timeout
16:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ban him please, he grabs ips
17:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I can proof that he stole several account information and changed passwords and removed money from accounts.
17:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> This is inacceptable, such behaviour should lead to a direct ban, he should not be permitted to broadcast any servers anytime again
