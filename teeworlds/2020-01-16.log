13:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might make sense to add a discord channel for references, like developer references, help references, FAQ links etc?
13:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> why a discord channel?
13:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> and why do you ask this on IRC?
13:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm on bridge ._.
13:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I ask in both
13:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> to have an easy access to everything related to the game and a fast overview, I guess
13:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> probably best to talk of discord-related things in #general
13:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> like a lot of dc channels are just there for information and have the chatting functions disabled
13:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or announcements
13:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or changelog
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <n000b> Makes sense, f3
14:53  * day votes for "< bridge> [teeworlds]" to be shortened to "< bridge> [tw]" or something like that
14:53 < Dune> any berliner around going to iem katowice btw?
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> iem "intel extreme masters" for anyone except me wondering
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> says sc2 and cs:go on the website
15:23 < Dune> no teeworlds i'm afraid :)
15:23 < day> they dropped teeworlds? :O
15:24 < Dune> we got less wallhacks than cs:go :p
15:33 < day> yeah the hacking in cs:go is beyond fucked up. they even cheat on-stage >_<
15:38 < Dune> I mean, so do the AGDQ people ;)
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> "we got less wallhacks than cs:go :p"
17:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> is this really an archivement?
17:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you should really add an anouncements channel
17:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> there you could easily advertise teeworlds 0.7.5
17:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> rules: only mods and admins can post there, @everyone is allowed
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the teeworlds discord is one of the biggest teeworlds related discords, you can advertise here
17:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> let's talk about this in #general ;)
21:35 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> Oy: send brain on https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2291 pls I have no idea how to make it smarter
21:35 < bridge> [freenode] <ChillerDragon> (still think its fine tho)
21:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> depends on the workflow. one might drop a new map into their maps folder while searching for it.
21:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> would remove the need to restart the client.
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or separate refresh from search logic.
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe restarting the editor already refreshes it?
21:48 < Dune> Oy is not here
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 wat? That sounds like a edge case. Itâ€™s more about updating the filter on keypresses. Currently it refilters from scratch on every key pressed
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But imo performance is fine
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe some kind of avl tree
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yea and thatâ€™s the part where Iâ€™m out
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or maybe just uodating a cached array
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> without reading the filesystem
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> rip c-style :D
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Iâ€™d prefer benchmarking it before making the code a mess
21:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> What about keeping the code like it is when my raspberry can handle 500+ maps without noticeable delay
21:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> reading from file system on dialog popup, keeping it not uodated until the dialog is restarted
21:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> aybe you did notbrun it on a potato yet :D
21:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ay
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> may
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Isnâ€™t rasp a potato
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> making complex abstractions is easy, understanding them less so
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> minimize abstractions
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> string list then
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Use machine learning and put it on blockchain
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the cloud! :)
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> make the masterservers do the rendering computing
22:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Serverless master servers
22:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> No server no ddos ðŸ¤”
22:02 < rand> I'm looking at the "weak" hook issue. Forgetting about that a wrong calculation might be a feature in some mods, could a solution be to clamp speed after calculation AND to compute separatly the impact of hooking ?
22:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> just leave it as it is ðŸ™‚
22:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is it actually a harm anywhere?
22:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> before breaking core physics rather spend time on all the other "actual" issues
22:12 < rand> I like when it is perfectly balanced, as all things should be
22:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it is fair the longer you survive the stronger your hook is
22:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> avoid dieing and you keep ur strong hook imo its good feature
22:14 < rand> that's not the issue iirc
22:14 < rand> the issue is about the player's id
22:14 < rand> this does not change while playing, isn't it ?
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> id only changes on reconnect
23:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> it's about which character was added to the gameworld first... this happens each time you respawn
