16:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Is anything of the old name system planned to be reimplemented? Name changes? No duplicated names?
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Name change is unlikely, there are good reasons to disallow that
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Hmk
20:42 < day> suicides in ctf shouldn't count towards the 'death' score imho
20:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> should add a suicide penalty of 5 to deaths :D
21:22 < Dune> day, why?
21:23 < Dune> if you fall a lot in the ctf5 pits that's probably an indicator your skill is not too high
21:28 < day> anyone who is half decent will use it as a means to reset
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> selfkill by bind adds a way too long respawn delay to be usefull. Selfkill by using grenade or map is also time consuming depending on position and health. So in most cases it is faster to travel normally.
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
21:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Also even in pro games people die in a fight by grenade selfdamage. Should count as kill then imo.
21:37 < Dune> falling in the pit is much faster in quite a few cases
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Btw is there a reason why the log only shows the major version? I could not find any log message being more specific than ``version 0.6``or ``version 0.7`` why isnt it showing minor versions as well?
