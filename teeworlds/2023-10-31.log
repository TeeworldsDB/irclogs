01:46 < bridge> <jxsl13> does libtw2 offer any lossless way to compress demo files into teehistorian files and vice versa?
02:00 < bridge> <heinrich5991> no
02:01 < bridge> <heinrich5991> Zwelf is working on a way to turn teehistorian files into demos
02:02 < bridge> <jxsl13> I got a few hundred gigs of demo files, would like to save some space
02:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> try zstd
02:14 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's working quite well with demos IIRC
