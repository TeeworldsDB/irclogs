10:18 < day> Dune: how does the steam updating work?
10:18 < day> is there a login that lets you upload a new version into steam?
10:20 < day> well obv. there's one, what i mainly mean is, is it registered to a single person?
10:21 < Dune> Day, kinda? You need to have admin powers on your steam account obviously. Then you package it and exec a command to upload
10:21 < Dune> No heinrich is the main guy but others can
10:21 < day> ah so he registered it with steam?
10:21 < day> or rather valve
10:28 < Dune> Yes
10:31 < day> i see
20:13 < TeeSlayer> is it somehow possible to get the client version?
