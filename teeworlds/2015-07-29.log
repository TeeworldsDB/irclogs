18:31 <@matricks> minus: BOO
18:31 <@matricks> minus: got new features for bam comming :)
18:32 <@minus> matricks: what do you have in store for us?
18:33 <@matricks> several things!
18:33 <@matricks> https://github.com/matricks/bam/tree/cachesplit
18:33 <@matricks> fixes issues when you are switching back and forth between different compiles
18:33 <@matricks> reduces the amount of recompiles that happens
18:33 <@matricks> still, untested at large
18:33 <@matricks> https://github.com/matricks/bam/tree/errormessages
18:34 <@matricks> clean up and better error messages from the scripts
18:34 <@matricks> more uniform error messages as well
18:34 <@matricks> https://github.com/matricks/bam/tree/rules
18:34 <@matricks> the ability to specify dependency rules so you can enforce module bounderies in the build script
18:35 <@matricks> that one is the really intressting one
18:35 <@matricks> all these are still too untested for me to merge into the master
