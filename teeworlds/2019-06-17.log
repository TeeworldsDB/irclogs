17:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> @heinrich5991 Awesome, thanks! Now we just need to delete the Teeworlds docs (@Dune) to avoid future confusion and remove the doubled effort to maintain both. ðŸ˜›
17:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Huh? The docs are on teeworlds.com, they are linked from a bit everywhere. They are much more detailed too. The recent cmake addition should be ported there.
17:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> The README used to simply redirect there
17:37 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> ... nvm, just found the link in the readme to the Teeworlds Docs.
17:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Anyway, it feels unnecessary to maintain both, the readme and teeworlds docs... just my thoughts.
17:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> the readme doesn't have to be maintained that much , its just there as a... readme, brief and basic informations
17:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Feels more natural for me to look on the GitHub project page for code-related instructions. Plus, the ReadMe is up-to-date. (: Whatever, I should be studying right now ðŸ˜… 
17:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Sorry for the inconvenience, you are doing great work!
18:26 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/issues/23
18:26 < Dune> We can't fit (and should not fit) an entire documentation in the README. Build instructions should be written in the doc.
20:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think build instructions are fine in the readme, other projects also maintain it that way
