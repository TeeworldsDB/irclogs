15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> deen wrote some tool to port maps to 0.7 and the result crashes the client. Should we try to fix the client crashbug?
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Well anyways here is a backtrace: http://paste.pr0.tips/tF
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> It can be reproduced on @jason54 | BlackPast server at 185.157.246.162:8204
15:32 < deen> (There are many ways to crash the client with broken maps, I'll have to fix my tool.)
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes for sure the tool has to be fixed. But should we try to fix all those crashes?
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no, because they only appear when modifing the map in a wrong way
15:42 < redix> no matter how broken a map is... ideally it should not crash the client
16:24 <@heinrich5991> the map code doesn't even pretend to try to prevent crashes right now
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
