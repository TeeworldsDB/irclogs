15:16 < Sadale> heinrich5991, your website is boring :P
15:17 <@heinrich5991> Sadale: haven't I given you enough to poke around in?
15:17 < Sadale> heinrich5991, BTW, the maps archive is useful. Thanks :3
15:18 <@heinrich5991> great! :)
15:19 < Sadale> heinrich5991, apparently the _index.html was the homepage :p
15:19 < Sadale> "No content yet!"
15:19 <@heinrich5991> :)
15:19 <@heinrich5991> if you have a decent internet connection, could you put your downloadedmaps into an archive, and upload it for me? trying to bug as many people as possible to keep the map collection up-to-date
15:20 < Sadale> heinrich5991, well, my archive isn't complete. :(
15:20 < Sadale> and I haven't play teeworlds for a while, unfortunately :(
15:20 <@heinrich5991> ah, well
15:21 < Henningstone> If you want I can give you mine with currently just about 700 maps :)
15:21  * Sadale checks his archiev
15:21 <@heinrich5991> Henningstone: it'd be awesome if you could give me these
15:22  * Sadale counting the numbers of maps
15:22 < Sadale> I guess I should have much more than 700 maps
15:22 < Sadale> heinrich5991, I have 5149 maps.
15:23 < Sadale> Some of them are probably duplicates or different versions or variants.
15:23 < Sadale> heinrich5991, want it?
15:23 <@heinrich5991> Sadale: sounds great. yes!
15:24 < Sadale> heinrich5991, that's going to take a while for me to upload to my own server :p
15:25 < Sadale> Now I'm retrieving them maps from intranet.
15:25 < Sadale> s/them/the/
15:25 <@heinrich5991> yea
15:25 < Sadale> And it's going to take you a while to download it form my server because it's throttled :P
15:26 <@heinrich5991> Sadale: I can offer you https://heinrich5991.de/temp/names.py
15:27 <@heinrich5991> this script will try to only put maps into the archive that I don't have yet
15:27 <@heinrich5991> execute it from a place that has a downloadedmaps folder containing the desired contents
15:27 < Sadale> heinrich5991, how does it work? :o
15:28 <@heinrich5991> you can read the script
15:28 < Sadale> The INPUT looks sketchy.
15:28 <@heinrich5991> yes
15:28 < Sadale> What that even is?
15:28 <@heinrich5991> that's all known map names, compressed
15:28 < Sadale> ah. got it :)
15:29 <@heinrich5991> the actual script is very short, a bit at the top, a bit at the bottom
15:29 < Sadale> HerzogDeXtEr, if my downloadedmaps is located in /path/to/downloadedmaps/, then the working directory to run this script should be /path/to/ , right?
15:30 <@heinrich5991> yes
15:30 < Sadale> got it!
15:30 <@heinrich5991> it has no status output by the way
15:30 < Sadale> doesn't matter as long as it works :p
15:30 <@heinrich5991> afk food
15:54 < Sadale> heinrich5991, PM'd you the maps.
15:54 < Henningstone> mine are still uploading :( Slow internet...
15:55 < Sadale> Henningstone, I got a personal website accessible via LAN :P
15:55 < Sadale> That's why it get uploaded so quickly :3
16:22 < Sadale> heinrich5991, let me know when you finish downloading it :3
16:23 < Sadale> (purpose: to satisfy my curiosity xD)
17:19 < Sadale> alright. Goodnight guys :3
17:19 < Henningstone> bye
