11:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @heinrich5991 we are releasing today, can your port binaries to Steam at some point when they'll be on teeworlds.com?
11:19 <@heinrich5991> Dune: if you have the binaries, I could upload them to steam already
11:30 < Oy> hey
11:38 <@heinrich5991> hi :)
11:42 < Oy> win and mac is on github
11:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> rip the motd :x
11:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> maybe I'm being pessimistic and people will try escape :p
11:45 < Oy> both work
11:45 < Oy> escape always worked too
11:45 < Oy> motd is a popup, they all close with escape
11:49 < Oy> merry christmas everyone :)
11:53 < Oy> will be out soon till very late evening today. just go ahead with the release then :)
11:53 < Dune_> ok :)
11:53 < Dune_> what do you mean by "both work" though?
11:53 < Dune_> tab doesn't work in my experience, did that change?
11:54 < Dune_> oh I'm stupid - https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/0cc8e8530dedda8510b9a0407beb9203a4f6d673
11:54 < Dune_> thanks
11:55 < Oy> :P
11:55 < Oy> moved all open 0.7.2. issues to 0.7.3 milestone and closes 0.7.2 milestone on github
11:56 < Dune_> *checks*
11:57 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to 0.6: https://git.io/fhUGO
11:57 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/0.6 93f5bf6 oy: updated version for the 0.6 version server
11:57 < Oy> anything else u need me to do?
11:58 < Dune_> the 0.7 version server is updated I assume?
11:58 < Dune_> if so, we're all set, thanks :)
11:59 < Dune_> (I mean, the code for it shows 0.7.2)
12:01 <@heinrich5991> merry christmas :)
12:01 <@Dune_> isn't that early? :)
12:01 <@heinrich5991> not for germany, I think(?)
12:01 <@heinrich5991> in germany, christmas eve is the special day
12:02 <@heinrich5991> is that different for france?
12:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> @heinrich its christmas "eve"
12:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> its because for jews (and muslims btw) the day starts once the sun sets the day before
12:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> (kind of)
12:03 <@Dune_> I don't know if it's a nationwide thing, but we definitely say that the 25th here, or the 24th at midnight
12:04 < Oy> the code for the 0.7 version server is updated too yeah
12:05 <@Dune_> bridge: closed 0.6.0<=x<0.6.5 downloads
12:05 <@Dune_> alright, well have a nice day, Oy :)
12:14 < Oy> thx. have a nice day too :)
12:21 <@Dune_> heinrich5991: all 5 binaries are on https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/releases
12:21 <@Dune_> linux relases are not tested
13:04 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr opened pull request #1925: Fix Christmas time detection (!) (master...fix-xmas) https://git.io/fhUnW
13:06 <@heinrich5991> Dune_: so I should not upload the release for now?
13:06 <@Dune_> no, it is broken
13:08 <@heinrich5991> Dune_: we don't have anyone but oy building macos/windows, right?
13:08 <@Dune_> I assume you can't build mac, heinrich5991?
13:08 <@Dune_> I could build windows, but mac is tricky
13:08 <@heinrich5991> no, I can't build mac
13:08 <@heinrich5991> so merging this wouldn't help, we need to wait for oy anyway?
13:08 <@Dune_> it sounds like it. oy will only be back in "very late evening" though
13:09 <@Dune_> releasing without mac is probably a sucky option
13:09 <@heinrich5991> I don't like it
13:10 <@heinrich5991> (but it might be the pragmatic option, so feel free to ignore me ^^)
13:10 <@Dune_> it's not a given that you are here this late too
13:10 <@Dune_> the alternative would be to ask a mac guy
13:10 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: do you know how to build a working dmg?
13:12 <@Dune_> @ChillerDragon
13:12 <@heinrich5991> uh, that works? ^^
13:12 <@heinrich5991> @heinrich5991
13:12 <@heinrich5991> yup, does
13:13 <@Dune_> not always
13:13 <@Dune_> sent Oy a mail in any c ase
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i can
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> oh
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hi, @ChillerDragon
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i am totally sick lying in bed :c
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> :(
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what happened?
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> thailand xd
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but i would die for tw
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so do you need something?
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> haha, that's some passion
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> So here's what happened, we were ready to release the special christmas update and Oy went out
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> During the checks, it appeared there is a critical bug, so we need to rebuild everything
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> We can handle Windows and Linux, but not Mac
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> No hate and i love you all. But if i leave my bed now to spend all my last powers to build something and then it gets declined agian i get mad xd
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so you really need it? then i can do it ofc.
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <magnet> @ChillerDragon your sacrifice will be remembered
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> rest assured we'll use it this time, Oy is out for good
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> k
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> build current master to dmg?
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> not current master
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/, branch fix-xmas
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> k
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I could merge it in though
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> would be nice
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> alright
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> meh heinrichs pr is still not there. This will be fun.
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah, that's the thing
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Do you remember what is left to do?
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> No
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it will take me some time
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hmm
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @heinrich5991 could you fix the PR for mac somehow?
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh boi its 12 instead of 11 ?
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> thats the change xd
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> heinrich only has to merge my prs
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> then it should work for me
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> or i can git wizardly merge them locally
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> then you can simply work from your branch?
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i succ at advanced git
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Alright, I'll try to make it all on my local repo so you only have to pull and compile
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it would be a nice start if ur pr gets merged
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh that would be super helpfull ‚ù§
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> isnt it easier to simply hexedit that? xd
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> might be :P
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/pull/15/files
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> from unknown repository lol
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye ikr
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> alright, I'll do it
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i succ at git and delete my repos all the time
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon 
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> git fetch  https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds 4chiller
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> git checkout FETCH_HEAD -b 0.7.2
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ty
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> then you should be able to make
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> do we have somebody to thest the build then?
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you üòÅ
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> uff
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well we will see
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its a fetch and not a clone o.O
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so i first clone tw master?
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you have to be on a teeworlds repository for this to work
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if you cannot test, I will find another way. building is already enough :)
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Testing on my macbook is a bad test because it is blown with libs and doesnt represent an average mac device
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> That's not that bad
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it failed 5 fixes on my moms imac when it already run on my device
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> moms break stuff
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Things to test for:
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> - server starts normally
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> - client starts and shows 0.7.2 version
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> - f1 has the xmas_hats option
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> - xmas hats are displayed by default (can be checked in the settings > Tee)
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> either it is me being too wasted rn or idk
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i followed my own instructions from the past and it failed :c
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> make package_dmg
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> make: *** No rule to make target `package_dmg'.  Stop.
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you're still in thailand?
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> huh
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no i am at home c:
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but thai got me some nasty virus
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> CMakeLists.txt:1664:  add_custom_target(package_dmg DEPENDS ${CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME}.dmg)
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> CMakeLists.txt:1665:  list(APPEND PACKAGE_TARGETS package_dmg)
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> CMakeLists should contain that
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye i also found my changes in the git log
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it has to be me beeing stupid
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> or sick :)
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well this is weird
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i will try to do everything alone from scratch
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> even tho ur boilerplate looks good
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/pull/15/files and https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/pull/17/files were merged in, as well as heinrich's PR
15:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye i can see that
15:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but somehow it doesnt find make package_dmg i have no idea what causes that issue
15:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what was the cmd agian to merge heirnichs pr locally?
15:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> surely you have to `cmake . -something`? I'm no CMake guru
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cmake ..
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye i documented everything in my prs because i know that i tend to forget stuff
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i also reread all the chat with heinrich
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `git pull https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/ pr_cmake` merges his cmake into your repository
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nice ty
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> do you have the working 0.7.1 release? you can work from that too
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> maybe it will be easier
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if you can build 0.7.1
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and apply the change manually
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> that is my plan
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> manually? what change? ^^
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah, my fix?
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ur 11 12 fix
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well you don't need to do it manually but sure
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yuk conflicts
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if you can find your working repository, you can update it with  this simple command:
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `git pull https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds master`
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what files conflicts? `git status`
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so far they are fine
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> just version.h
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> makes sense
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> mabye i spell package wrong
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xxxD
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> does it build?
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i have no idea what changed
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no the cmake package_dmg fails
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ohhh wait
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> cd build
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> cmake ..
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> cmake -DCMAKE_OTOOL=otool .
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> make package_dmg
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i latley build hanbrake and i think i t installed me a new cmake
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe my new cmake from handbrake is broken
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah nvm its make not cmake
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i still have an old folder on my desktop where make_packge is working
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> copy paste it
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but it has some dirty stuff in the working tree
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and it is outdated
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's fine
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> copy paste the folder
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> k
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> then run this:
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> git reset --hard
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> git checkout origin/master
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> git pull https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/ master
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ouch but git reset --hard removes my fixes
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it does?
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the dirty working tree are my fixes
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah then you want to keep the dirty stuff
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe commit
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> idk
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> easy then
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> git commit -a -m "Dirty fixes"
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and then?
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> git pull https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/ master
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> doesnt -a adds everything
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it does
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> why is my working tree still dirty lol
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what does `git status` say
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> some folders in other
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i git add them and will commit agian
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> sure
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ok im clean now
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i fear conflicts
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `git pull https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds.git master`
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> should just be `version.h`
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i got conflicts xd
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh and submodue
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> possibly storage
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we see submodules later
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> try to build first
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i dont get it why make_pakcage is working there
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and not in the newer versions
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lucky me that i save thousands of folders all the time everywhere
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it doesn't work?
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> in this old folder it works
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but i dont see the difference to ur fork for example
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> PR is probably incomplete then
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we can check that later
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sadly i have a linker fail
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and the nobo macos update destroyed reable linking output -.-
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so you don't know what fails,
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ?
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon>   "_main", referenced from:
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon>       start in crt1.10.6.o
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon>      (maybe you meant: _SDL_main)
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> thats the only usefull bit i coudl find
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> make clean?
16:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> good idea
16:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> meh same resolut
16:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> do you have the linker fail with the old folder?
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it has to be cuased by the update
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so the update broke linking, uh
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe not the update directly
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe wrong git usage
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what were the conflict files!,
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ?
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> storage
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> version
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and uhm
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> submodules
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh i didnt fix the submodules
16:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what was the update command?
16:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `git submodule update`
16:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> unlikely to help
16:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y no changes
16:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hmmmmm
16:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> check `src/engine/shared/storage.cpp`
16:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> around line 240 you should see
16:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```                aResDir

16:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y
16:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> resdir is my ugly var xd
16:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but it is there

16:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i used vs code for conflict so it should be nobo save
16:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> let's see CMakeList.txt

16:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> let's see
16:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the sdl2 framework exsists in the other folder
16:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't know :|
16:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i am a nobo at debugging anyways but my brain is so dead brain now this doesnt help :c
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hmmm
16:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe it has something to do with the annoying branches
16:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and i mix up master and pr_cmake
16:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you shouldn't have manipulated any sort of branch for this
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> just pull teeworlds from your dirty repo
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> mind pushing?
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `git branch` to know what branch you are on
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y ik
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @ChillerDragon do you use cmake-gui?
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> try it üòÉ
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> much easier
16:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we have a linking problem @LordSk
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i am afraight of guis
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> they confuse me
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune>   "_main", referenced from:
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune>       start in crt1.10.6.o
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune>      (maybe you meant: _SDL_main)
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ```
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> did everything from scratch a little bit different same result
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> so SDL_main isnt linked?
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it seems that my old version builds fine
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> more like _main isn't linked I assume?
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but then then after upgrading to current master it fails
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> do we have a new sdl linkage?
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> there is a SDL_main lib for that purpose
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> in the last 200ish commits
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> no
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> afk dying a little bit real quick
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @LordSk building 0.7.1 works. git pull teeworlds, resolve two conflicts, and it doesn't work
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> can't he hard reset?
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and using cmake-gui is very straight forward
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hard reset what? to the branches?
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> to master
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> to what branches*
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> master won't work
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we need the cmake fixes
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @heinrich5991 's PR wasn't merged
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it is one file tho?
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> or am I mistaken
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> not only one: https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/pull/15/files
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/pull/17/files
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I dunno it shouldn't be that hard tbh
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what do you suggest?
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> merry christmas to all of you
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> merry christmas @Fisico üòÑ
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> why doesnt bam work is the real question here
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> why do we need cmake?
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't think we have the time to try something entirely new
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it should work fine tho?
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it did for years
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well apparently it didn't
16:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> to me the issue is SDL_main isnt linked
16:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @ChillerDragon give us your CMakeCache
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im back!
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y sure sec
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://pastebin.com/raw/hJX0HMwM
16:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @LordSk
16:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah im reading
16:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> pushy Dune :p
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i still think someone can do this way faster with some hexediting the binary file
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Maybe i can fake a dmg
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> try changing the SDL2_DIR path to your sdl2 directory
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> if i build the binary and then squeeze it into a finished 0.7.1 dmg
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how?`
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and run cmake again
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> where
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> edit the cache file
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ```
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> //The directory containing a CMake configuration file for SDL2.
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> SDL2_DIR:PATH=/usr/local/lib/cmake/SDL2
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> 
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> //Path to a file.
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> SDL2_INCLUDEDIR:PATH=/Library/Frameworks/SDL2.framework/Headers
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> 
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> //Path to a library.
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> SDL2_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/Library/Frameworks/SDL2.framework
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ```
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> to the sdl framework i have in the tw dir directly?
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> that makes sense
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> actually there should be a FindSDL2 in your teeworlds folder right?
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe it takes one with wrong version or something
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> where?
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> directly in the root?
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> not sure let me look at the pr
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ./cmake/FIndSDL2.cmake
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i have that
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah that one
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> should i eidt that?
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> point it to the cmake folder
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> the SDL2_DIR
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how ? xd
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sry im nobo
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it's fine
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> edit your CMakeCache file
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> the line I pasted earlier
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> put the path to the FindSDL2.cmake there instead
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> this might do nothing btw
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> uhm so i need a realtive path?
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> starting from where?
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> from the build?
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so ../other/sdl/etc...
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah no
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i mean ../cmake/FindSDL2.cmake
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I'd go absolute just to be sure
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd uff
16:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so the SDL2_Dir:PATH=
16:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> or which one
16:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> or SDL2_LIBRARY:FILEPATH
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> first one
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y did
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> same result
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> did you run cmake again?
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> just make package_dmg
16:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> you have to run cmake for the changes to apply
16:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> doesnt that reset my Cache?
16:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it should not
16:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well still same result
16:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and CMakeCache.txt was resetett
16:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> as i expected
16:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well it is weird because it worked in 0.7.1
16:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> :c
16:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> how do you run cmake?
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/pull/17
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ```
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> mkdir build
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cd build
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cmake ..
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cmake -DCMAKE_OTOOL=otool .
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> make package_dmg
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ```
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I'm not sure why the cache is reset
16:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i have no idea< how ccmake worst but i thought if u run cmake it crates the cache file
16:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and make builds depending on that file
16:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> well usually you run it once, it tells you if it succeeded
16:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> if not you makes changes and run it again
16:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> if not you make changes and run it again
16:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> normally i would keep bruteforcing now but i am way to exhausted i will lay down a bit now ._. if someone has an promising idea feel free to ping me
16:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> thanks for trying üòÉ
17:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> time to hex edit :D
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> +1
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i only tried something like that once to bypass some nethash thingy or something like that to do some illegal stuff with vanilla modding hehe but i failed
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> shoudlnt the binary diff of the two linux versions give a pretty good hint where the 12 is located?
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon it does, on linux
17:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `00121CF0 0C 0B`
17:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but how do you do it on mac :p
17:52 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/fhUES
17:52 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 0cebd1b Jordy Ruiz: Fix Christmas time detection
17:52 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master b4101dc Jordy Ruiz: Merge pull request #1925 from Dune-jr/fix-xmas...
18:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> heinrich5991 / @heinrich5991 inp_grab is being troublesome
19:26 <@Dune_> is minus around?
19:32 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] LordSk opened pull request #1927: Default inp_grab to 1 to be consistent with previous 0.7 releases (master...fix/inp_grab_default) https://git.io/fhUgy
19:34 < minus> i think minus is around, Dune_
19:35 <@Dune_> that's nice
19:35 < minus> it is
19:35 <@Dune_> I'll try not to disturb the celebrations too long
19:35 < minus> celebrations are done
19:35 <@Dune_> that was quick
19:36 <@Dune_> after Oy left for the day (at least) we found two issues in the code
19:36 <@Dune_> the first was a bug that was quickly patched
19:36 <@Dune_> the second was that Oy added an inp_grab option to revert to 0.6 mouse behavior (not raw input, take in account mouse accel)
19:37 <@Dune_> this option is set to 0 by default, meaning that it *reverts* back to 0.6 by default, instead of keeping 0.7.1 behavior
19:37 <@Dune_> we are in the process of releasing 0.7.2. do you think I should change that option's default?
19:39 < minus> to how it was in 0.7.0?
19:39 <@Dune_> and 0.7.1, yes
19:39 <@Dune_> (we have to rebuild binaries anyway)
19:41 < minus> if the new default makes more sense, use the new one, if it can be considered a bugfix to revert it to 0.6, do it
19:41 < minus> in general changing defaults isn't great
19:41 <@Dune_> this option never existed and is introduced in 0.7.2
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> so 0.7.2 makes the new default like 0.6 was
19:42 < minus> can you link me to some info
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> which seems weird
19:42 <@Dune_> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1910
19:45 <@Dune_> This is LordSk's pending PR for 0.7.2: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1927
19:51 < minus> that option's naming is pretty bad
19:51 < minus> i'ma have to try
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> inp_grab 1 is raw input, 0.7 default
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> the mouse position is reset to the center of the screen, teeworlds use offsets every frame
19:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> inp_grab 01 is 0.6 behaviour aka desktop mouse mode
19:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> inp_grab 0 is 0.6 behaviour aka desktop mouse mode
19:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> 1 should be default
19:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Old 06 behaviour should be optional
19:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I agree Sonix
19:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> But we prefer raw input so there is a bias
20:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> in ddnet they've just added inp_mouseold 1,0 to enable/disable old mouse behaviour
20:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i remember
20:01 < minus> so it should be a grab_mode?
20:01 < minus> raw and reset
20:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> The question is only if the default should be changed in Oy's absence, assuming it is a mistake, or not
20:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> there's no reason to make it default again??
20:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ^
20:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> inconsistent with previous releases too
20:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> it should just be an option for players that are used with old mouse behaviour
20:04 < minus> if raw is the better mode, it should be default
20:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> raw is the 0.7 mode
20:04 < minus> if it just doesn't work properly then it shouldn't be default
20:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> better I don't know üòõ
20:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_MODE_WARP
20:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> it works, how it works is subjective
20:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> "By default SDL will use raw input for relative mouse mode"
20:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I say let's go, we can blame minus if it goes awry
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> just put raw default, its okay
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah
20:29 <@Dune_> so I still have to guess whether that's intentional or not
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> doesn't matter i think
20:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> The problem are old players. If we want to have a smooth transition from 0.6 to 0.7, we should kept settings for such relevant thing as it was in 0.6.
20:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> We didn't tho
20:32 <@Dune_> the transition is way past us
20:32 <@Dune_> the question isn't whether this is a better change, but whether this should be considered a bu
20:32 <@Dune_> g
20:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Transition will last for a month at least. I think, we should stay with 0.6-setting, I don't think so, Oy did it by accident ^.^
20:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we *already* changed
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if we set the defaults now, they cannot be changed again
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> There's an option in settings to get back to 0.6 behaviour? (inp_grab 0)?
20:36 <@Dune_> that's what we're talking about, @Savander
20:37 <@Dune_> ah, not in the settings, no
20:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> It could be feature then
20:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Then stick to 0.7 default ( inp_grab 1)
20:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> with option in settings tab, to get back to old behaviour
20:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> btw. inp_grab descriptions is quite bad
20:38 <@Dune_> I'll repeat, in case it's not clear. The question is: "is inp_grab defaulting to 0 a bug?"
20:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> hard to understand
20:38 <@Dune_> I'm inclining towards no
20:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Probably not, but if it changes behaviour of mosue between minor versions, it sound bad no?
20:39 <@Dune_> it sounds bad yeah, but I'm no judge of that
20:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> so we can wait for Oy, or someone have to make decision üòÑ
20:40 <@Dune_> Oy will come too late for that
20:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> or we release tomorrow, chillerdragon is dead anyway
20:41 <@Dune_> Alright, I'll assume this is not a bug.
20:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> we don't have a mac build
20:41 <@Dune_> If it is, we can edit the release later I assume
20:41 <@Dune_> or maybe not
20:41 <@Dune_> we do
20:41 <@Dune_> only with the "no change" choice
20:41 <@Dune_> so I'll just put that then
20:41 <@Dune_> even though I disagree with the change
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> we don't even have a menu option
20:42 <@Dune_> yeah
20:42 <@Dune_> it's bad
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> to reenable the default 0.7 behaviour
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> this is VERY bad
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> actually, very bad yea
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> so let's wait for Oy, extend the event
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> and description for that command is weird."Use forceful input grabbing method"
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> doesn't really matter if the setting is clear
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> also, 0.7.2 before release, we could extend the time of event maybe
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> to whole december
20:44 <@Dune_> I also think we should
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yes that'd be much better
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Since, 6 decemeber
20:44 <@Dune_> huh
20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Santa Claus thing
20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> and 24-27 december Christams
20:45 <@Dune_> there is no Santa Claus thing?
20:46 <@Dune_> @heinrich5991 halp
20:46 < minus> lemme try 0.7.1
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> No? In poland, we have santa's day
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> or something like that, don't know how to translate it to english actually
20:47 <@Dune_> 0.6 = no raw input
20:47 <@Dune_> 0.7.0/1 = raw input
20:47 <@Dune_> 0.7.2 = optional raw input. default=?
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> 0.7.2 default = raw input
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ^
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> ^
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and if we do that, no mac release so let's wait
20:48 <@Dune_> xmas is today for some people
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Yea, xmas is here for poland as well
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I think, 24 december is most important here
20:49 <@Dune_> yeah. in france it's different
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah well the update shoulve come at the beginning of december
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> about 6 december, that's curious. I though you have similar event as well
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> but it's seems that you don't üòÆ
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> not in the middle of christmas
20:52 < minus> should there be a difference between inp_grab 0 and 1 in master?
20:52 <@Dune_> yes
20:52 < minus> i don't notice any
20:53 < minus> but that may be related to my setup
20:53 <@Dune_> inp_grab 1 = raw input
20:53 <@Dune_> inp_grab 0 = OS settings such as mouse accel
20:53 <@Dune_> I don't notice any either because I don't have any accel
20:53 < minus> oh well, i don't have that crap on
20:53 <@Dune_> most players do
20:53 < minus> dumbest invention ever if you ask me
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Does mouse-speed set via OS changes speed of cursor as well? with inp_grab = 0
20:55 <@Dune_> likely does
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it does
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I think, by defualt it's in the middle on windows
20:57 <@Dune_> well, I need heinrich5991 for Steam either way, so I'll wait for now
22:59 <@heinrich5991> hi!
22:59 < Oy> the default value for inp_grab was intended
22:59 <@heinrich5991> I think we need a mac build, Oy
22:59 < Oy> hey
22:59 <@Dune_> hey
22:59 <@Dune_> mac build is there https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/releases
23:00 <@heinrich5991> oh ok
23:00 <@heinrich5991> then I misunderstood the situation
23:00 <@Dune_> chillerdragon helped
23:00 <@heinrich5991> ah
23:00 <@Dune_> but #1927 was a hard one
23:01 < Oy> mouse behaviour should be like in the previous master versions
23:01 <@heinrich5991> wait
23:01 <@heinrich5991> like in 0.7 or 0.6?
23:01 <@heinrich5991> currently, it defaults to 0.6 behavior
23:01 < Oy> 0.6, 0.5, 0.4 etc
23:01 <@heinrich5991> k
23:02 < Oy> yeah, that's correct
23:03 < Oy> that warp mode wasn't working in times when the move to sdl2 was done
23:03 < Oy> but seems to work now
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> sdl2.0.9 doesn't work I think
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> need 2.0.8
23:04 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:04 <@heinrich5991> should use 2.0.8
23:04 <@heinrich5991> at least for windows
23:04 < Oy> yeah
23:04 <@heinrich5991> warp mode sounds kinda like a hack, raw mode sounds cleaner: https://forums.libsdl.org/viewtopic.php?t=11838
23:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> linux x64 checked
23:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> reuploading windows almost done
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> heinrich5991: can you download and port to steam?
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can release immediately
23:08 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1928: Document `inp_grab` a little (master...pr_doc_inpgrab) https://git.io/fhUoI
23:11 < Oy> it don't just disable mouse acceleration, but considers your os mouse settings
23:12 <@heinrich5991> for some reason, I can't unpack the dmg :(
23:13 < minus> that discord bridge is seriously annoying
23:13 < minus> at least matrix bridges better
23:13 <@heinrich5991> matrix doesn't bridge to quakenet
23:14 <@Dune_> heinrich5991: need to remake a .dmg? :/
23:14 <@Dune_> we can ask Oy
23:14 <@heinrich5991> no, this might just be me not being able to open it on linux
23:14 < Oy> sounds odd to me
23:15 <@heinrich5991> usually 7z x teeworlds-*-osx.dmg works
23:15 < Oy> yeah
23:15 <@heinrich5991> now it outputs files that look like partitions
23:15 <@heinrich5991> 0.MBR 1.Primary GPT Header 2.Primary GPT Table 3.free 4.Apple_APFS 5.free 6.Backup GPT Table 7.Backup GPT Header
23:16 < Oy> was it build with the release script?
23:16 <@heinrich5991> Dune_: ^
23:16 <@Dune_> yes Oy
23:16 < Oy> heinrich5991: how is it for the 0.7.1 one?
23:17 < minus> maybe someone should set up CI/CD to build shit
23:17 < minus> note: not me
23:17 < minus> i've done it before
23:17 <@heinrich5991> that works, the 0.7.1 thing
23:17 <@heinrich5991> on the todo list :P after finishing the stupid cmake stuff
23:18 <@heinrich5991> also the ability to test would be nice now that we have wishlist items ^^
23:18 < Oy> i didn't build on the latest mac osx version though
23:19 <@Dune_> ah, damn me, I forgot to write the steam draft announcement
23:19 < Oy> could build a new one
23:19 < Oy> would take some min
23:19 <@heinrich5991> a few mins don't hurt if you got the time
23:20 <@Dune_> chillerdragon won't be happy though, he did it while being sick and all :c
23:20 <@heinrich5991> :|
23:20 <@Dune_> almost released but the inp_grab stuff made me doubt :|
23:20 <@heinrich5991> you could try to test the dmg he built. if it works for mac users, it's fine
23:20 <@heinrich5991> I just need the archive contents
23:22 <@heinrich5991> I think the problem for me is that it contains an APFS file system while the old one probably contained an HFS+ file system
23:22 <@heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System relatively new
23:23 < Oy> hm, doesn't work for older mac versions that should still work
23:26 <@Dune_> well, rebuild then oy
23:40 < Oy> updated the github one
23:43 <@heinrich5991> uploaded to teeworlds.com
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> teeworlds.com has github links anyway
23:47 <@heinrich5991> still :)
23:47 < Oy> what about start page?
23:48 < Oy> download tw for your os- button
23:51 <@heinrich5991> updated
23:51 <@heinrich5991> Dune_: do we have a release announcement?
23:53 <@heinrich5991> Oy: is it intended that the win32 archive doesn't contain a freetype.dll?
23:53 < Oy> nope
23:53 < Oy> should be in there
23:53 < Oy> doesn't run otherwise
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I built it statically in
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> since you weren't here Oy
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hey btw
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> merry christmas üòÉ
23:54 < Oy> hey
23:55 < Oy> why not use the dll?
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> but I'd rather have you do it if you don't mind
23:55 < minus> *cough* static linking
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I'm not sure the release I did works correctly
23:57 < Oy> the win64 one on github started for me
23:57 <@heinrich5991> minus: not really a difference if you ship the dlls next to the program
23:57 < Oy> will test the win32 too
23:57 < minus> heinrich5991: except you can't forget shipping the DLLs
23:57 < minus> :D
23:58 < Sajadi> Merry Christmas from Austria :)
