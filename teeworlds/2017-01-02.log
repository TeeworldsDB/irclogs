10:56 <+necropotame> There is someone that noticed the effect of the "Flow" component ingame? It seems completely invisible for me. Like I've understood it, an explosion should push blood particules away. But I've never saw that in practice.
12:25 <@heinrich5991> I think I specifically tried it out somewhen
12:25 <@heinrich5991> and it was there
12:25 <@heinrich5991> but that was a couple of years back, so dunno

12:55 <@matricks> necropotame: in general explosions, bullet etc effect particles
12:55 <@matricks> necropotame: dunno if it works anymore, I implemented that years ago
12:55 <@matricks> necropotame: more of a proof-of-concept as it needed more work
12:55 <+necropotame> I've read the code and it seems that it works, but I'm not sure if it's visible ^^
12:57 <+necropotame> But nice idea anyway :)
