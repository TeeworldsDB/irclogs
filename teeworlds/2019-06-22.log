10:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> what was the rcon command to list maps, again?
18:06 < bridge_> [freenode] <ytexas> quit
18:11 < minus> terminate
18:11 < bridge_> [freenode] <ytexas> Excuse me... May I looking for server issue here? My server seems can not communicate with master server (such as master1.teeworlds.com). But my PC and other people's ECS still can communicate with master server. I guess maybe banned cause of modifed TDM mode. But I didn't see my server address on master ban list (status.tw). So.. Does master ban list update on time? If I was ban <message clipped>
18:11 < bridge_> [freenode] <ytexas> unban? thx >.<
18:11 < minus> check if it's in there https://www.teeworlds.com/master-bans.cfg
18:11 < minus> but shit's most likely just fucked
18:13 < bridge_> [freenode] <ytexas> thx.. But still not find my server address. TuT
18:13 < minus> if it's not in there it's not banned
18:13 < bridge_> [freenode] <ytexas> thx >.<
18:13 < minus> but master servers are basically in an eternal state of DDoS
18:15 < bridge_> [freenode] <ytexas> O.O
