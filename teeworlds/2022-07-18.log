21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> teeworlds.com is down, database is dead.
21:03 < minus> Hm
21:03 < minus> I'll take a look
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thx
21:14 < user774> hello?
21:14 < user774> is anyone here?
21:16 < user774> I can't see the userlist
21:17 < user774> nevermind I see now
21:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nobody here
21:17 < user774> website down! https://teeworlds.com is 3-10% up!
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://discord.gg/teeworlds
21:33 < minus> Kottizen_ hosts the DB
21:36 < minus> while i could technically restore the DB from a backup to a local mysql instance, i'd rather not and instead wait for Kottizen_ to bring it back up
22:09 < user774> am I still here?
22:10 < user774> ok so the server is responding so
22:13 < minus> are any of us even real?
22:15 < user774> we're all at least 3% real
22:40 < Kottizen> Whoj! I'm sorry! I upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0 to get hot reloading of TLS certificates... Now it's back on track. I'm sorry for the downtime!
22:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> Wait... so it wasn't just a trick to get us hyped for the surprise reveal of "teeworlds 2.0" site?
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nice
