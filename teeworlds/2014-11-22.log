20:26 < nameless_tee10> with 3.3
20:26 <@minus> seems like you ran it with python 2
20:26 < nameless_tee10> mh
20:27 < nameless_tee10> i try again
20:27 <@minus> "python3 script.py"
20:27 <@minus> python probably defaults to python2 (whjich is likely installed too)
20:27 < nameless_tee10> it is
20:27 < nameless_tee10> i remove
20:27 < nameless_tee10> wait

20:35 <@minus> yw
22:12 < swiftkick> greetings
22:13 <@matricks> GREETINGS!
22:14 < swiftkick> I notice https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=client_config lists, for windows operating systems, the *folder* for the config files, but not the actual name of the config file in which I can put client settings such as gfx_fullscreen . 
22:14 < swiftkick> or will any file there ending in .cfg be parsed for such settings?
22:15 <@matricks> autoexec.cfg if I remember correctly
22:15 < swiftkick> thank you :-)
22:15 < swiftkick> I have an LG 21:9 monitor and the default teeworlds config doesnt render properly at all in fullscreen.
22:16 <@matricks> oh.. what happens?
22:16 <@matricks> 21:9 isn't really supported
22:16 <@matricks> you will be at an disadvantage online
22:16 < swiftkick> basically it overscans
22:16 < swiftkick> thats why i wanted to run it in a window, surely that would resolve any rendering issues
22:17 <@matricks> yah
22:17 <@minus> 21:9 is not wide enough, needs 32:10 at least
22:17 < swiftkick> lol
22:17 < swiftkick> i want my next monitor to be a circular hoop, like a lamp shade, that i can put over my head
22:17 <@matricks> I think those are called vr googles
22:17 <@matricks> goggles
22:19 < swiftkick> i know but goggles are so limiting. I want to struggle with craning my neck to try to see more of the screen, and instead having it rotate the entire display. That sounds like a good way to waste time and harm my musculature at the same time.
22:20  * swiftkick also thinks one of us left a </sarcasm> tag off in there somewhere. 
22:21 < swiftkick> hmmm, I tried creating a file "autoexec.cfg" in %APPDATA%\Teeworlds
22:21 < swiftkick> tried both: gfx_fullscreen 0     and   gfx_fullscreen=0
22:21 < swiftkick> and teeworlds still launches in fullscreen
22:22 <@minus> put it in settings.cfg
22:22 < swiftkick> thank you :-)
22:23 < swiftkick> didnt work
22:23 < swiftkick> settings.cfg is there now, and populated with lots of settings (it wasnt there a minute ago, lol)
22:23 < swiftkick> but adding gfx_fullscreen 0 to the top of the list didnt seem to stop it from launching in fullscreen
22:24 <@matricks> add it to the bottom
22:24 <@matricks> it's executed top to bottom
22:24 < swiftkick> actually
22:24 < swiftkick> now that I look at it
22:24 < swiftkick> its already in there
22:24 < swiftkick> in the section of all the other gfx_* directives
22:24 < swiftkick> gfx_fullscreen 0
22:25 < swiftkick> but I'll try adding a 2nd instance of that directive to the bottom of the file
22:25 <@minus> patch gfx_height and gfx_width
22:25 < swiftkick> aha
22:26 < swiftkick> settings.cfg is being overwritten  with each launch
22:27 <@minus> yes
22:27 < swiftkick> so then where do i put settings
22:29 < swiftkick> if its overwritten each run, and each run resets the file contents to "gfx_fullscreen 0", and yet that setting doesnt actually change the game launch... not exactly very encouraging
22:59 < swiftkick> btw it works... got distracted playing :-) THANK YOU
23:00 < swiftkick> gfx_height and gfx_width were the key settings
