02:44 < JulianAssange> this is nice
14:57 < matricks> minus: yo, for a decent debugger, checkout QtCreator
14:57 < matricks> easy to setup a debugging session without creating a complicated project etc
15:09 <@minus> matricks: i've used it before
15:09 <@minus> managed to crash it every now and then
15:12 < matricks> oh
18:04 < heinrich5991> also, msvc has an awesome debugger
18:05 <@matricks> "awesome"
18:05 <@minus> CLions debugger seems not too bad too
18:05 <@minus> but Java + slow
18:06 < heinrich5991> matricks: I found it intuitive and have yet to find a suitable replacement for linux
18:06 < heinrich5991> maybe I should check out QtCreator :)
18:06 <@matricks> QtCreator is close to msvc
18:07 <@matricks> but the msvc debugger is.. well.. meh
18:07 <@matricks> it works and thats about it
18:07 < heinrich5991> matricks: I mean it worked with teeworlds
18:07 < heinrich5991> I found that pretty awesome, given that I haven't compiled using a project of theirs
18:07 < heinrich5991> (and I like stuff that just works out of the box :) )
18:08 <@matricks> gaming, can talk about this latter
18:26 <@minus> maintenance now or not now?
18:27 < jxsl13> now
18:27 < jxsl13> to be or not to be
19:36 <@minus> k done
