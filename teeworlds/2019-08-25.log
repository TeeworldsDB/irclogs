00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> ohh I think the bunny with not fold over ears could actually work 😮
09:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> we could intoduce multiple types of hats
09:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> like in tf2 😄
09:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune @Oy is there an issue you would want me to implement?
11:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @@𝓔𝓼𝓼𝓲𝓰𝓪𝓾𝓽𝓸𝓶𝓪𝓽 Oy isn't here but sure. There's 2142, 2050 and 2024 are in the milestone too
11:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> 2142 should be doable, 2050 I don't know the demo system at all, 2024 maybe later
14:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I have implemented the confusable utf8 system now myself :) no more same names, no names or almost same names, like captial i and small L
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune how do I add a remote to my repo and update to tw master? I couldnt get it with the discussion from last time...
14:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://intercom.help/assembladocs/en/articles/1136998-how-to-add-a-new-remote-to-your-git-repo
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yea. and how do I update then?
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `git pull origin master` or `git merge master`
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but I have another origin already
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> then `git pull upstream master`
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what now

14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thanks, dune
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune should I add an echo_server, too?
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> don't change existing commands
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> wait that exists?
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `say`?
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> say sends in chat for everyone
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> echo should be client_side only for oneself
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> that beggs the question for echo_server
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> bind x rcon "do stuff" echo_server "done"
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> wait it doesn't make sense
17:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Assa Echo is also server-side. Don't change it
17:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I didn't knew this command exists
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i wonder if a heartbleed is possible with echo
20:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is there a table to check the broadcast color codes?
20:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Or like which format is it?
20:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (I am talking about the "^xxx")
20:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (I am talking about the `^xxx`)
20:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ^RGB
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> each goes from 0 to 9, @fokkonaut
20:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ^999 = white
20:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ^000 = black
20:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ^900 = red
20:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> questions?
20:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> for R = 255: r = (int)(R*10/256);
