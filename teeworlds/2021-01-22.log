15:51 < seabass_> Hello ChillerDragon, did you server have a blip very recently?
15:52 < seabass_> Teeworlds crashed whilst I was on your server, you see. Others playing also had Teeworlds crash on them
16:12 < ChillerDragon> whats a blip?
16:12 < ChillerDragon> Did you have an actual client crash? Or just laggs on the server?
16:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> thanos reference i guess
16:12 < seabass> Indeed, an actual client crash
16:12 < seabass> I think everyone else on the server had it too
16:13 < ChillerDragon> wtf
16:13 < ChillerDragon> what makes you think that others crashed too?
16:13 < seabass> They told me in the chat
16:13 < ChillerDragon> and what client are you using?
16:13 < seabass> Err... let me check
16:13 < ChillerDragon> lol vanilla server being vanilla client crasher
16:13 < ChillerDragon> something makes me doubt that
16:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> ðŸ¤–  sus
16:14 < seabass> OK I asked the package manager; it's teeworlds-0.7.5-1.fc31
16:14 < seabass> (fc31 being a Fedora version)
16:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> oof
16:15 < seabass> ooh a bug report by abrt
16:15 < seabass> SIGSEGV
16:15 < ChillerDragon> yikes
16:16 < ChillerDragon> nice time to write some tw exploits
16:16 < seabass> hope not :/
16:16 < ChillerDragon> do you have a backtrace or a coredump?
16:16 < seabass> I'm looking... I hardly know abrt
16:17 < seabass> Do you know how to use abrt?
16:17 < ChillerDragon> hm no
16:17 < ChillerDragon> when did it happen maybe i see somethign in the logs
16:17 < seabass> 14:40:24
16:23 < seabass> OK I can give you the backtrace :)
16:23 < seabass> https://x0.at/khk.txt
16:25 < seabass> Hmm I don't like these two lines:
16:25 < seabass> Likely crash reason: Jump to an invalid address
16:25 < seabass> Exploitable rating (0-9 scale): 6
16:43 < ChillerDragon> yikers
16:43 < ChillerDragon> maybe open a issue on github if you have this nice trace
16:45 < seabass> OK... I don't have a Github account, but maybe...
16:45 < seabass> Did you see anything weird on your end?
16:50 < ChillerDragon> i can confrim that at 14:40 multiple tees left the server
16:50 < seabass> hmm so clearly a client-side bug
16:50 < seabass> but not all tees?
16:51 < ChillerDragon> no not all
16:52 < ChillerDragon> this looks bad
16:52 < seabass> hmm can you, as a server admin, see which versions the tees where in?
16:52 < seabass> like maybe it's been fixed upstream and I'm just out of date
16:52 < ChillerDragon> do you have a demo of it?
16:52 < ChillerDragon> maybe it has some hints
16:53 < ChillerDragon> i think versions are not logged
16:53 < ChillerDragon> well i mean i see that versions are not logged xd
16:53 < ChillerDragon> I guess ill open a issue with ur backtrace then
16:55 < ChillerDragon> can you maybe send your client binary
16:55 < ChillerDragon> maybe in combination with the offset in the backtrace that can  be useful
16:55 < ChillerDragon> im not a debugging guru
16:55 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 @heinrich5991 alert client segfault
16:56 < seabass> send the binary?
16:56 < seabass> Like all of it?
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> what an odd backtrace, can't figure out what the offsets are without the binary as it seems to be a release build
16:57 < seabass> OK - it might be Red Hat messing with it
16:57 < seabass> you know how Fedora is with binaries :)
16:57 < ChillerDragon> lol rly?
16:58 < seabass> Well, they removed emacs tetris because of trademark concerns
16:58 < seabass> in fact they removed it twice, but left the command in
17:01 < ChillerDragon> so where can we get the binary now?
17:01 < seabass> Erm, I can't even find it
17:01 < seabass> sorry :D
17:01 < ChillerDragon> yikes
17:02 < seabass> no no it's just Firejail weirdness
17:02 < seabass> /usr/local/bin/teeworlds -> /usr/bin/firejail
17:02 < ChillerDragon> dfq
17:02 < seabass> got it
17:03 < seabass> ./teeworlds: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable
17:03 < seabass> here's the sum to start with: sha256sum
17:03 < seabass> a45afb1c1b52f19df025b7e55041b01313d28756901b46ee752b39de15be358b
17:05 < ChillerDragon> yay
17:05 < seabass> https://x0.at/cEz.bin
17:06 < seabass> is the actual binary
17:11 < ChillerDragon> do you have autorecord demos on?
17:11 < seabass> nope :(
17:11 < ChillerDragon> sad
17:12 < seabass> well I can't reproduce it
17:17 < ChillerDragon> seabass: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2848
17:17 < seabass> ChillerDragon, thanks :)
17:18 < seabass> I'll watch the issue and try and learn some GDB maybe as well :)
18:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> try llldb
18:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lldb
