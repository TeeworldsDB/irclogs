17:24 <@minus> matricks: have you written stuff in rust yet?
17:25 <@matricks> nope
17:28 <@minus> major pain without properly knowing rust, without IDE, without proper docs
17:29 < heinrich5991> minus: docs are fine IMO
17:29 <@matricks> minus: no need for an ide
17:29 <@matricks> minus: I just use sublime
17:30 <@matricks> the pain before was 1.0 status
17:31 <@minus> woot, it worked
17:35 <@minus> matricks: need an IDE when working with libraries
17:36 <@minus> because integrated documentation is great
17:36 <@matricks> :/
17:36 <@minus> i'll go code something in C++ instead now.
17:37 <@minus> really should do something with the website
17:38 <@minus> so much packet loss

17:44 <@minus> that was a "uh, windows"
18:02 < LittleWhite> Some people says : "You just need vim" :D
18:04 <@minus> i've been using vim so far for it
18:05 <@minus> there's "racer", a completer for rust. but it doesn't work with YouCompleteMe which I also have installed
18:33  * matricks tries to plan his next week
