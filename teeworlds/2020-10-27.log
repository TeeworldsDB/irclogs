00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: you can use the packet_decode from libtw2 tools
00:11 < ChillerDragon> im not better at reading rust than c
00:11 < ChillerDragon> or does it help me reading the packet when run?
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it outputs the packet
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in human readable form
00:12 < ChillerDragon> how do i input it tho
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the input is a bit excentric though
00:12 < ChillerDragon> stdin?
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> need to prefix |
00:12 < ChillerDragon> hex?
00:12 < ChillerDragon> raw?
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> and suffix | after the hex
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hex
00:12 < ChillerDragon> ok
00:12 < ChillerDragon> sounds good
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> oh wait, coming from you it might be a 0.7 packet
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> don't have support for that
00:14 < ChillerDragon> meh
00:14 < ChillerDragon> i mean cool and all but a bit of a weird tool isnt it?
00:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> wdym?
00:14 < ChillerDragon> what about a wireshark dissector instead
00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I tried doing that afterwards, but my motivation got lost midway
00:15 < ChillerDragon> meh
00:15 < ChillerDragon> i really miss a proper dissector for tw
00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think @Learath2 started a packet dissector
00:15 < ChillerDragon> ye ik
00:15 < ChillerDragon> but he also does not seem to continue it
00:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> have you tried it? maybe it's at a stage where it's useful to you
00:16 < ChillerDragon> i messed with fstds c dissector and nheirs lua implementation
00:16 < ChillerDragon> was not too successful
00:16 < ChillerDragon> oh wait
00:17 < ChillerDragon> you are talking about using not implementing?
00:17 < ChillerDragon> i havent seen learaths dissector
00:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but it doesn't look like it's able to dissect at a level where you need it
00:18 < ChillerDragon> it even has a huffman.c that looks promising
00:19 < ChillerDragon> but heinrich do u know maybe how i can read the packets without a dissector?
00:19 < ChillerDragon> like at least find out the type
00:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> give the bytes in a usable format please
00:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> maybe base64
00:20 < ChillerDragon> wot
00:21 < ChillerDragon> why is hex not useful?
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> or hex
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but not an image
00:21 < ChillerDragon> xd
00:21 < ChillerDragon> fair
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> and preferably only the UDP payload
00:21 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/LP
00:21 < ChillerDragon> oop
00:22 < ChillerDragon> thats all
00:22 < ChillerDragon> also including my ip :D
00:22 < ChillerDragon> idk how to only get udp payload with tcpdump
00:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you already did that in the original screenshot
00:22 < ChillerDragon> ikr
00:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> open it in wireshark, I guess
00:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you can get the udp payload there
00:22 < ChillerDragon> well
00:22 < ChillerDragon> ye ik
00:24 < ChillerDragon> working w gui applications is so annoying no clue how to copy stuff
00:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> try rightclick
00:25 < ChillerDragon> that copies it all
00:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ok, rightclick "Data" below "User Datagram Protocol" and select "Copy" â†’ "as a Hex Stream"
00:27 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/Rk that should be a manual slice only with the udp data
00:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> does that work?
00:27 < ChillerDragon> idk
00:27 < ChillerDragon> 003d0200000031402318300140454545454545454545454545454545454545454545454545454545454545450000172996fedfda029bfedfda02280014000000000000000023
00:27 < ChillerDragon> thats the result
00:27 < ChillerDragon> could be it
00:27 < ChillerDragon> yes
00:28 < ChillerDragon> when compared to my manual slice it looks good
00:28 < ChillerDragon> i realized that chat messages are usually prefixed with 300140 but idk where that comes from
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> now we can look into src/engine/shared/network.h
00:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it says 7 bytes header
00:31 < ChillerDragon> ye bcs chat is probably not connless
00:31 < ChillerDragon> what is connless btw is it only in the beginning before there is a token?
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> flags is 0, ack is some uninteresting number, numchunks is 2
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so we're expecting two chunks
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no compression, so that's also good
00:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> connless: server info, masterserver communication
00:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> uhm
00:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> your token very much looks like it's just one byte
00:32 < ChillerDragon> sounds secure
00:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you might want to check the code that generates it, it's likely to be vulnerable to IP spoofing
00:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> anyway
00:33 < ChillerDragon> not that i changed that xd
00:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> which server did you connect to?
00:33 < ChillerDragon> do we have a security issue again?
00:34 < ChillerDragon> uhm
00:34 < ChillerDragon> ddnet7 i think
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> next byte is 40
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that should be the message ID
00:35 < ChillerDragon> yes ddnet7 confirmed
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah no, it's not
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the chunk header
00:35 < ChillerDragon> wait u lost me at the 1 byte token
00:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we now see the chunk header 40 23 18
00:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we check src/engine/shared/network.h again
00:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> flags is VITAL, size is 8, we also have a sequence number
00:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so now the next byte should be the msgid
00:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> 0x30 == 0b0011_0000
00:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that should just be 0x30 = 48, lowest bit is system flag, since it's an even number it's apparently a game message
00:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> number 24
00:39 < ChillerDragon> oh
00:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we check build/src/generated/protocol.h
00:40 < ChillerDragon> ye i was searching that 24
00:40 < ChillerDragon> but i did not expect it to be a 30
00:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it says CL_SAY
00:40 < ChillerDragon> ye
00:40 < ChillerDragon> i was looking for that
00:40 < ChillerDragon> the systemflag got me
00:42 < ChillerDragon> wait but how did u see 0b0011_0000 is 24?
00:42 < ChillerDragon> isnt lowest bit 0 here?
00:42 < ChillerDragon> ah
00:43 < ChillerDragon> ye but its not counted
00:43 < ChillerDragon> so its 0b0011_000
00:43 < ChillerDragon> aah
00:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> 0x30 = 48, and then I halfed that
00:44 < ChillerDragon> but it is not a fixed offset is it? So i can not use tcpdump to check for 0x30 at this index
00:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> halved*
00:44 < ChillerDragon> ye
00:44 < ChillerDragon> got that part now i hope
00:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it'll work in practice
00:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> is that enough?
00:44 < ChillerDragon> yea sounds good
00:44 < ChillerDragon> think i learned a lot thanks mate
00:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you're welcome
01:08 < ChillerDragon> u said my token is only 1 byte long? I read 3 zero bytes followed by 0x31 is that correct? So my token could also start by chance with leading zeros?
01:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, but unlikely
01:08 < ChillerDragon> ye
01:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it's 1/16million
01:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so basically impossible
01:17 < ChillerDragon> meh the fixed index does not work too well I sent 6 messages got 10 packets that contained 2 of my chat messages :D
01:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I dissect enough for seeing tokens and stuff, tho it's only ddnet tokens for now
01:18 < ChillerDragon> where are ur install instructions btw
01:21 < ChillerDragon> ``tcpdump -X 'dst port 8707 and udp[18:1] = 0x30'`` thats the command i tried in case anyone wonders (hi me grepping this in 2 month in the logs)
01:22 < ChillerDragon> is the bridge even allowed to format code snippets on discord?
01:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> yes it is
01:22 < ChillerDragon> nice
01:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> There are no install instructions, you clone wireshark, you place my repo in the plugins folder and compile
01:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> wireshark doesn't have a standalone plugin build thing
01:23 < ChillerDragon> that sounds very much like a install instruction to me
01:23 < ChillerDragon> something i would have guessed
01:23 < ChillerDragon> but still a readme having the two git clones and maybe a cd in order would help a lot
11:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> oy: can we increase the vote reason string size as well please :P
11:37 < Dune> @tsfreddie: you should join irc if you want to speak to oy
11:37 < Dune> he's not always online
11:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> oof. i don't know how to use it everytime i tried
11:38 < Dune> easy, just follow this link: https://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=#teeworlds
11:39 < TsFreddie> oof
13:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> why cant he use discord
13:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> where 95% of the tw community is
13:07 < TsFreddie> ask ChillerDragon
13:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> hes a troll
13:07 < TsFreddie> you are too
13:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> ðŸ¤£
13:10 < TsFreddie> btw, turns out it is not me don't know how to use it. it's just china banned quakenet as well.
13:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> sounds fun
13:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> im not a troll
13:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> no u @TsFreddie
14:11 < louis> irc baad
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> no u
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Did anyone create a teeworlds server with an online translator yet?
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes early 0.7 there was one
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> ðŸ¤£ why tho
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> On my server there are players from all over the world, its really hard to follow all conversations, I would like to implement a translator
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune is the source anywhere?
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> every chat message was received twice
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i remember that server
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but i dont know which mod it was
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> don't think there is any source? maybe it was SNSnoop's ddrace?
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> why not do it client side
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> because few people use custom clients
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> in 0.7
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> few? alot
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> those who do often stayed in 0.6
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> because they care about their custom stuff that they are used to
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> sure.
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nope, wasnt snoops mod
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> but i feel that ppl who want translations would probably look for custom clients instead of finding server that does it.
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thats not the point here
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> oh
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> the point is that especially on my server many people cant speak english well, i got multiple people asking for a translator on my server :D
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> that make sense
16:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so, does anyone have the source code or knows who made the 0.7 mod with translator?
17:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> there was a server on 0.6
17:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> with ingame translation but by command with a !
17:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> !de>en (text)
19:31 < ChillerDragon> i have a crappy translator in zillycrack client @fokkonaut im not sure if it belongs in the server 
19:31 < ChillerDragon> also @TsFreddie if you want a irc account on my webui where you can keep logs and so on tell me
19:34 < ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut its rly messy and uses some sketchy ruski api :D https://github.com/ZillyWoods/ZillyWoods/commits/584662c47308541a3a7f490756b7abbdf0697ae3
19:37 < ChillerDragon> but fokko send kids to school so they learn english and implement other things first like bank,jail,fng,1n1 etc
20:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Mh
21:03 < louis> @ChillerDragon put entities images in teeworlds-db
21:03  * louis slaps ChillerDragon around a bit with a large fishbot
21:03  * louis slaps ChillerDragon around a bit with a large fishbot
21:03 < louis> haha i can slap people in irc 
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> @fokkonaut in mkrace was a translator
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i cant find it in the code
22:49 < ChillerDragon> which entitites @louis
23:02 < ChillerDragonTL> There is https://github.com/TeeworldsDB/mapres/tree/master/entities if you have some more please pull request :)
23:45 < louis> yes these @chiller
23:45 < louis> u should put them in a separate folder tho, not mapres
23:46 < louis_> well at least put the playable ones in a sep. folder
23:46 < louis_> like the ones for ddrace since new client update lets u customize them, lul
23:53 < ChillerDragonTL> You mean a repository only for entities to play with? Hm yea maybe sounds like a duplicate tho since they are just mapres essentially
