01:24 < heinrich5991> matricks: how do you debug mouse-grabbing software like teeworlds?
07:32 <@minus> laxa: is that plugin open sauce?
07:33 <@minus> laxa: do you use Mr-Anderson's API?
08:07 < laxa> Yes it is open source minus
08:07 < laxa> I use EastBite API
08:07 < laxa> https://github.com/Laxa/Nimda3 forked from noother's bot
08:07 < laxa> plugin/user/Plugin_TwPlayerStatus.php
08:19 <@minus> does that api have docs?
08:22 <@minus> EastBite: please provide info
10:13 < EastBite> minus: it's a nodejs/ajax backend which accepts GET params and responds which json
10:13 < EastBite> https://github.com/east/twstat
10:13 < EastBite> example: http://ebeur.eastbit.net:8888/get/nameless%20tee/matchall
10:14 < EastBite> I don't want to write docs because the api in it's current state is rather bad
13:32 < mmsc> fisted: 
18:06 < Siile> hi all
18:07 < Siile> anyone wanna try deathmatch without ninjarope?
18:07 < Siile> it has walljumps, i wanna try it out with ppl
18:07 < Siile> it = mod
18:07 < heinrich5991> Siile: can you give us the client, then?
18:08 < Siile> y
18:08 < Siile> win32: http://ninslash.com/tat/norope.zip
18:09 < Siile> heinrich5991, wanna join?
18:09 < Siile> or just asking?
18:09 < heinrich5991> Siile: I don't have win32
18:09 < heinrich5991> yes, I want to join
18:12 < EastBite> ninjarope?
18:12 < Siile> ever tried it?
18:12 < Siile> right mouse click
18:12 < heinrich5991> without hook I guess, right?
18:12 < Siile> the same thing
18:12 < heinrich5991> ninja rope sounds so wormish
18:12 < heinrich5991> :)
18:13 < heinrich5991> wormsish
18:16 < Siile> I've got server up and running, name: Siile's test server
18:35 < EastBite> what's ninjarope
18:36 < Siile> its a thing I made
18:36 < EastBite> make a video
18:36 < Siile> spinning rope that has a ninja in the end
18:36 < Siile> ok, sec
19:35 < Siile> which file generates protocol.cpp?
19:38 < BeaR> compile.py if I remember correctly (:
19:39 < Siile> oh, where does it get the values from?
19:40 < BeaR> network.py contains the structs
19:41 < Siile> nice, thanks
20:12 <@minus> EastBite: that code is, as a german proverb says, not the yellow of the egg
20:12 <@minus> mine's not any better though. except that it's python and not js
20:14 < EastBite> is it because of js or some design flaws?
20:18 <@minus> code looks rather random
20:18 <@minus> and js, yes
20:19 < EastBite> the callback stuff makes long procedures always ugly
20:19 <@minus> coroutines!
20:21 <@minus> i honestly tried with asyncio
20:21 <@minus> didn't get shit to work
20:21 < EastBite> but in js everything is async
20:22 <@minus> yes, with callbacks. coroutines rock more (in combination with callbacks where needed)
20:22 < EastBite> and how would that look like in reference to tw requests?
20:24 <@minus> instead of having a success callback for a recvfrom you just have a "data = yield socket.recvfrom()", the yield returns control to the event loop and it can process other things while waiting for data
20:26 <@minus> twisted does that in a great way
