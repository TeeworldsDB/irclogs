08:50 < black-roland> lately unknown bot connects to all teeworlds servers: joins with a random nickname (stolen from another user), joins spectators and after a while leaves
08:50 < black-roland> does anyone know what is it?
08:51 < black-roland> ip of bot: 86.241.209.67
12:18 <@minus> yeah, i know who that is
12:29 < black-roland> minus, and who? :) and what this bot do?
12:41 <@minus> it most likely collects scores for teerank.com
12:42 < black-roland> minus, but teerank.com for CTF only. this bot connects to DM/FNG servers too
12:42 <@minus> maybe he's expanding
12:43 < black-roland> minus, hm, thank you for answer :)
12:44 < Nibiru> good afternoon
12:44 < EastByte> minus: I thought teerank is collecting ranks via server info requests
12:45 < Nibiru> but, the info that teerank gathers is enough in server info, it doesn't have to join...
12:45 < Nibiru> sorry, didn't notice eastbyte said the same while was typing >_>
12:46 < Nibiru> we are just kinda bothered of this because this bot steals nicknames and its activity is very strange and seems malicious
12:47 < Nibiru> also it uses pingfake
12:47 < EastByte> does he move?
12:47 <@minus> EastByte: you may remember that teectac did modify the client to run headless and on low resources
12:47 < Nibiru> no, doesn't at all. it joins and immediately goes spec. we tried to force it out of specs, it didn't move at all and looked to the right
12:49 < EastByte> minus: actually, no
12:49 <@minus> well anyway, it's his ip
12:50 < EastByte> kk
12:51 < Nibiru> thank you a lot for your help, guys, now we figured out where this bot comes from: http://fictive-spring.herokuapp.com
12:52 < black-roland> it is Teectac's bot https://github.com/Teectac
12:52 < Nibiru> this site we found in tictac's github and it looks the same like site hosted on port 8080 of IP address that bot used to connect with
12:53 < Nibiru> to connect from*
13:04 <@minus> can you pm me the ip?
13:12 <@minus> sent teectac a PM requesting he stop his activities
13:13 < Nibiru> thank you, once more :)
