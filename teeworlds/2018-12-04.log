14:41 < ChillerDragon> @LordSK
14:43 < ChillerDragon> I hope it is not me because circleci builds
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> no it's me give me a minute ðŸ˜ƒ
14:44 < ChillerDragon> Ah i see it is in a ifdef macos
14:44 < ChillerDragon> how are these things called agian?
14:44 < ChillerDragon> preprocesorcompiler what everys
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @ChillerDragon
14:45 < ChillerDragon> @ChillerDragon
14:45 < ChillerDragon> ah nice the ping works via irc
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> alright it should be fixed @ChillerDragon
14:48 < ChillerDragon> builds c:
14:49 < ChillerDragon> i set gfx_highdpi to 1
14:49 < ChillerDragon> but it still doesn't allow my full desktop resolution :c
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hmmm
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> how do you know it's not using it?
14:51 < ChillerDragon> i can see pixels
14:51 < ChillerDragon> and i can see the resolution in the seetings
14:51 < ChillerDragon> I know it looks way sharper with my fix
14:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> do you have your fix up somewhere I can look?
14:52 < ChillerDragon> ye my pr
14:52 < ChillerDragon> is next to urs
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> woops alright let me have a look then
14:53 < ChillerDragon> I didnt read your full changes yet it is so annoying with all the space fixings
14:54 < ChillerDragon> That is why i prefer on pr for only space fixings and one for actual features
14:54 < ChillerDragon> @Dune :p
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah my text editor does that
14:54 < ChillerDragon> Oh thats nice
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> so if I understand correctly
14:55 < ChillerDragon> Would be awesome (only if you want) to load the file with your editor first then save it and commit as indentation fix
14:55 < ChillerDragon> so if someone wants to read the commits it is easier 
14:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> you are using  _FULLSCREEN
14:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> instead of _FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP
14:55 < ChillerDragon> y
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> can you test that out now?
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> you have new commit?
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I mean can you modify the line?
14:56 < ChillerDragon> oh y sure
14:56 < ChillerDragon> what file was it agian
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> L695
14:56 < ChillerDragon> backend sdl?
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> backend_sdl
14:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> remove the _DESKTOP at the end
14:57 < ChillerDragon> yy
14:58 < ChillerDragon> weird
14:58 < ChillerDragon> It still shows the low resolution in settings
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> that's fine
14:58 < ChillerDragon> but the tabbing out suport is gone
14:58 < ChillerDragon> like in my version
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> does it look crisp?
14:59 < ChillerDragon> sec lemme start a server to test
14:59 < ChillerDragon> woot
14:59 < ChillerDragon> i was able to tab out now xd
14:59 < ChillerDragon> but it looks good
15:00 < ChillerDragon> i dont get it
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok great
15:00 < ChillerDragon> haha!
15:00 < ChillerDragon> i got it
15:00 < ChillerDragon> when a server is started tabbing works
15:01 < ChillerDragon> because when startin the client while running a server a network box pops out and fixes the tabbing xd
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> that's probably a sdl issue though
15:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> nothing we can do really
15:02 < ChillerDragon> yea seems like
15:02 < ChillerDragon> but tabbing in and out helps to fix problems i noticed that on windows aswell
15:02 < ChillerDragon> but the only way to tab out of this version i currently found is a warning from the network device
15:03 < ChillerDragon> Well i guess your pr does exactly what mine does but a bin nicer
15:03 < ChillerDragon> ima close my pr then
15:04 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] ChillerDragon closed pull request #1753: Add high dpi config for macOS (#1659) (master...pr_mac_4k) https://git.io/fpo5M
15:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> what happens when you're not fullscreened @ChillerDragon ?
15:05 < ChillerDragon> hm lez see
15:05 < ChillerDragon> Oh i realized
15:06 < ChillerDragon> that turning fullscreen on and off enable tabbing in and out
15:06 < ChillerDragon> Thats a bit annoying
15:06 < ChillerDragon> maybe we could call fullscreen toggle automatically on launch
15:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> that's why the hack is there in the first place
15:07 < ChillerDragon> I still wonder why it doesnt show the correct resolution in the settings
15:07 < ChillerDragon> I think it worked in my version but i am not 100% sure anymore
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I can fix that but I don't think it's necessary
15:07 < ChillerDragon> It is
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> so what happens then, in windowed mode?
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> still crisp?
15:09 < ChillerDragon> no
15:09 < ChillerDragon> works fine aswell
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon>

15:10 < ChillerDragon> It is a bit annoying that while walking left you get this special char menu from macOS
15:10 < ChillerDragon> in the top left corner
15:11 < ChillerDragon> happens in fullscreen and window mode
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> wait so is it sharp or not?
15:11 < ChillerDragon> yes it is
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok great
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> can you try disabling high dpi mode?
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon trailing spaces are removed by some editors, it's not on purpose and yeah I agree it pollutes a bit the reading :)
15:12 < ChillerDragon> Ye thats what Lord said thats why i suggested to open the file and save it atleast into another commit
15:13 < ChillerDragon> but imo best way would be another pr
15:13 < ChillerDragon> What editor do you use @LordSK ?
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Qt Creator
15:14 < ChillerDragon> never heard of that
15:14 < ChillerDragon> btw without highdpi i get pixels everywhere
15:14 < ChillerDragon> and the selected resolution in settings is even worse
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/519516953258491918/Bildschirmfoto_2018-12-04_um_15.14.40.png
15:15 < ChillerDragon> it doesnt even show which one i use
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> oh wow
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I guess disabling it is working too then
15:16 < ChillerDragon> I think even tho it kills tabbing we should auto turn on highdpi if needed
15:16 < ChillerDragon> I am sure we can detect if we need highdpi
15:16 < ChillerDragon> and maybe for the tabbing toggle the window mode on launch
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> that's what I do already
15:16 < ChillerDragon> nice
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that all sounds messy and not something that should be in 0.7.1 :x
15:16 < ChillerDragon> ay -.- Dune
15:17 < ChillerDragon> that all messy stuff is proper macOS support
15:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune>

15:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> this screen looks buggy
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> why is it cropped?
15:18 < ChillerDragon> thats what i said
15:18 < ChillerDragon> that is lordsks pr without highdpi mode
15:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hence my "that all sounds messy" remark :P
15:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't know how that managed to break the settings screen
15:19 < ChillerDragon> Its a clasic
15:19 < ChillerDragon> we had that in ddnet multiple times even on windows
15:19 < ChillerDragon> before we had a polished support for all resolutions and platforms
15:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well, never seen that, idk what you guys broke
15:20 < ChillerDragon> its a feature
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I have never seen this problem in the vanilla teeworlds though
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so something triggers it
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I think clipping may be broken?
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I mean I broke it
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hidpi may break clipping I guess?
15:21 < ChillerDragon> me neither but i didnt play with vanilla client for ages
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> It was a lowdpi screenshot if I'm not mistaken
15:21 < ChillerDragon> y
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @ChillerDragon can you test the pr again please?
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y sure
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ,meh i killed my irc .-.
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what changed what should i test for
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> same things as before
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> fullscreen/windowed highdpi on/off
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and screenshot if you see anything suspicious ðŸ˜ƒ
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nothing changed
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> same bugs as before
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok so on fullscreen hpi-dpi off right?
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no matter if full or window without highdpi it gets buggy
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and even with highdpi i dont see the real resolution in settings
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> And can somebody tell me the command agian to join the irc? xd
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok thank you @ChillerDragon
15:46 < rand> > trailing spaces are removed by some editors...
15:46 < rand> I wonder it this could be teeworlds standards :3
15:46 < rand> commit -p ftw
15:46 < rand> check what you commit
15:50 < Dune> please no, I don't want to run a script on every commit
15:51 < Learath2> Dune: Why not? Many projects employ a pre-commit hook to maintain code quality :)
15:52 < Dune> I don't think it's worth it to go through that much trouble for some trailing spaces
15:55 < bridge> [freenode] <chiller> lul where am i
15:56 < Learath2> Well in this case yeah it is much trouble as the teeworlds style is really hard to configure on a tool like clang-format. But for js projects e.g. it's as simple as `prettier *`
16:25 < rand> commit -p anyway, don't git add
16:26 < Learath2> I never knew commit had a -p :) I usually do `git add -i` then `git commit` if I want finer control over what I commit
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> or just `git diff` to check the commit? :)
16:27 < Learath2> I do a `git diff master` before creating prs to make sure I didn't add extraneous data
16:30 < Dune> you don't do `git diff master | xxd` to check byte per byte? how can you even notice non-breaking spaces? ;)
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> Dune it's a diff
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> It _shows_ you
16:36 < Dune> not if a space was replaced by a non-breaking space on a modified line!
16:36 < Learath2> :D
16:56 < rand> it does
16:56 < rand> with a line - and a line +
16:56 < rand> you only don't see the difference

18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> hey oy, hey dune hey all ðŸ˜„
18:50 <@Dune> @savander mentions that spectators entry/exit does not print a server message on his 32p server
18:50 <@Dune> is that intended, even though there are only 4 active clients?
18:51 <@Dune> also, it still prints something in the console
18:56 < rand> it is
18:57 < rand> it should be possible to chat afterward though
18:57 <@Dune> isn't that a bit weird to have this setting on with a low # of players?
18:57 < rand> (from the issue, I understand that the player can't speak at all)
18:58 < rand> it is relevant for low #players but it's not for low #clients
18:58 <@Dune> thazt is a different issue
18:59 < rand> enter/leave of spectators are silent by default
19:00 < rand> still a bug
19:11 < rand> ok, the bug is "" as nickname prevent you to chat
19:24 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr opened pull request #1778: Move 'Show user IDs' option up to keep consistency (master...fix-buttonorder) https://git.io/fpPXX
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> is tw ipv6 ready btw? cant test it cause i dont have ipv6 at home.. but my server is ipv6 enabled
19:32 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1294
19:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> uh.. not so cool
19:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> dualstack should work
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> 25% traffic is ipv6, many are dualstack but also many are ipv6 only... and i think most servers support ipv4 so this will exclude the ipv6 functionality... when the issue is true
19:44 < rand> dual stack means the server has to contact the master server through both ips
19:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yes
19:45 < rand> i remember seeing two server entries for one server in lan but I can't reproduce
19:46 < rand> only the ipv4 is listed :c
19:59 < redix_> when implementing the https master, dual stack support should be considered
20:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yes...
20:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> why not work more with dns and reverse dns?
20:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> post external servers have a dns/reverse dns record
20:01 < redix_> at least in germany you sometimes only get an ipv6 address and a tunneled ipv4 address... the tunneled connection often has a rather bad quality
20:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yes
20:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ipv6 support in austria is very bad
20:02 < redix_> i have seen cases where the ipv4 ping was twice the ipv6 ping
20:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> Carrier-grade NAT is the problem there..
20:04 < redix_> btw... since the maps are final now... what about re enabling the mapchecker?
20:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> the comination from CGN and underpowered gateways from the isps.. but yea.. ipv4 adresses are rare these days
20:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what map checker?
20:07 < redix_> it checks the crc of standard maps to make sure they have not been modified
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> clientside i guess
20:08 < MertenNor> Hey
20:08 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> hi.  where the heck is everyone?  XD   the bots go away, but then so do all the players?  XD  empty games only.   :S  has everyone upgraded to the new clunky rewrite version?
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> since when i sthe map checker around?
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lul Meten
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hey
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Meten fokin Nor
20:08 < MertenNor> would it be hard to get a server running on a Pi3?
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rrr
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> gues no
20:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> had some 0.6 servers running there already
20:09 < MertenNor> ah nice
20:09 < redix_> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/834a433ca84e7e00ebdd9a5689d8a5631d7723c6/src/engine/shared/mapchecker.cpp#L49-L105
20:09 <@Dune> heyy MertenNor :)
20:09 <@Dune> it's been forever I haven't read that name
20:09 < MertenNor> Hey! :D
20:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> same
20:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i think i only read it in forum posts before my time xd
20:09 < MertenNor> same to you :D haha
20:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and saw ur yt video xd
20:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the random vanilla one
20:10 <@Dune> Digit: 0.6 servers are still vulnerable to reflection attacks, it may be what's happening.
20:10 < MertenNor> 0.7 is on the horizon :D want to get back to server hosting :D
20:10 <@Dune> cool :D
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 140k clicks on a tw video is solid
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd
20:10 <@Dune> we had so much trouble with the mac release, I was thinking about you actually, MertenNor :D
20:10 < MertenNor> had some servers for 0.6 but non many people played on them but I just like to have them up anyways haha
20:11 < MertenNor> HAHAHAHA
20:11 < MertenNor> Rly? 
20:11 < MertenNor> Good Old times!! haha
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well my mac version works great hehe
20:11 <@Dune> yeah, for real, mac is giving us a lot of trouble :)
20:11 < MertenNor> you should have reached out haha
20:12 <@Dune> how :D
20:13 < MertenNor> just google MertenNor not that hard :P
20:13 <@Dune> I get that: https://itch.io/profile/mertennor
20:13 < MertenNor> use it everywhere just send me a message on reddit or something.. but yeah 
20:13 <@Dune> :P
20:13 <@Dune> yeah I see, should have thought about it
20:14 <@Dune> in a surprising turn of event, everyone grew up :D (and got busy)
20:14 < MertenNor> well you did it wothout me anywas :P good job! 
20:14 < MertenNor> hahaha verry true!
20:15 < ChillerDragon> Thats why I am here Dune
20:15 < ChillerDragon> im not busy at all
20:15 <@Dune> we have a discord linked to irc now for convenience btw, if you don't have an IRC client ;)
20:16 < MertenNor> oh whats the discord?
20:16 < ChillerDragon> cooolkids meesanger
20:16 < ChillerDragon> replaced skype
20:16 <@Dune> exactly
20:17 <@Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12576
20:17 <@Dune> @ChillerDragon I think MertenNor knows what it is :D
20:17 < ChillerDragon> full troll xd
20:18 < MertenNor> cooolkids  ? you mean the Duch show? :P
20:18 < ChillerDragon> should i know that show? xd
20:19 < MertenNor> na.. nevermind 
20:19 < MertenNor> well guess I dont know then 
20:20 < MertenNor> so whats like the big 0.7 thing? 
20:20 < MertenNor> remember back in the day when people said that race was going to be supported 
20:24 < MertenNor> @Dune in the server info.. Difficulty and the different Difficulty variables.. looks like its not translated.
20:24 < ChillerDragon> well we have graphics for race
20:24 < ChillerDragon> in 0.7
20:24 <@Dune> yes MertenNor
20:24 <@Dune> https://www.transifex.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
20:24 <@Dune> if you want to participate to the translation ;)
20:24 <@Dune> ChillerDragon: huh? I don't think we do
20:24 <@Dune> MertenNor: lots of big things, where to start!
20:25 < MertenNor> ooh didnt see thoes.. updated it a few weeks ago.. Thanks! :)
20:26 <@Dune> oh you're the one who did that
20:26 < ChillerDragon> I am not sure Dune i thoight i saw something on github
20:26 <@Dune> yeah sorry we changed a few things so the newer strings weren't translated
20:26 < ChillerDragon> maybe it was just an idea
20:26 <@Dune> probably just an idea, yes
20:26 < MertenNor> "Mute broadcasts" inntrengning whats it for? 
20:26 <@Dune> to hide server broadcastrs
20:26 <@Dune> broadcasts were reintroduced and revamped
20:26 <@Dune> thanks to @lordks
20:27 < ChillerDragon> broadcast <3
20:27 < MertenNor> ooh
20:27 <@Dune> whispers were added (PM)
20:27 <@Dune> chat had biig changes
20:27 <@Dune> 64 player support was added
20:27 <@Dune> new skin system
20:27 <@Dune> etc. :P
20:27  * bridge [freenode] <Digit> facepalms, seeing loads of peeps in games, once he clicks the players column header again.  newbie mistake when decades past being a newbie.
20:27 < ChillerDragon> a freenoder o.O
20:28  * bridge [freenode] <Digit> was sure he did that already
20:28 < MertenNor> Cool :D
20:28 < MertenNor> 64 Player 10 flag CTF :P
20:28 < ChillerDragon> well 64p is theoretically supported but not enabled in vanilla ._.
20:29 < redix_> only 2 flags are supported :(
20:29 < MertenNor> just stack CTF5 like 5 times on the same map and there you go :P
20:29 <@Dune> haha redix_
20:29 <@Dune> vanilla with more than 12 players makes no sense imo lol
20:29 < MertenNor> mods for 0.7?
20:30 <@Dune> some are in the works ;)
20:30  * bridge [freenode] <Digit> pictures the crazy scene of dog fight type maps with clouds of knives
20:30 < ChillerDragon> u make no sense imo lul
20:30 < ChillerDragon> more tees more fun no matter what gametype
20:30 < MertenNor> @Dune cool like what 
20:30 <@Dune> huh, ok..
20:30 <@Dune> well you can always sv_gametype MOD and get more tees
20:31 <@Dune> MertenNor: not much is public yet because 0.7.1 was not released
20:31 < MertenNor> @Dune so we talking like official mods ?
20:31 <@Dune> mods are not official, by definition
20:31 <@Dune> there are new gametypes
20:31 < ChillerDragon> xd
20:32 <@Dune> survival and team survival
20:32  * bridge [freenode] <Digit> ponders what teeworlds 3d could be like, in a minetest sort of way
20:33 < MertenNor> what? teeworlds is getting Battle Royale now?   jk haha
20:33 <@Dune> yeah we're grabbing that fortnite playerbase
20:33 < MertenNor> but you know someone will make that mod xD haha
20:33 <@Dune> hehe
20:33 < MertenNor> HAHAHA
20:34 < ChillerDragon> lms is battle royal isnt it
20:35 < ChillerDragon> i made a lms mod for 0.6 before royal was a thing
20:35 <@Dune> i liked the bomb mod back in the days :) so simple
20:35 < redix_> no utf8 for player names?
20:35 <@Dune> not afaik redix_
20:36 <@Dune> but not sure
20:36 < redix_> NetStringStrict("m_pName"),
20:36 < redix_> nope 
20:38 < redix_> any reason for that? faking others with similar names isn't an argument anymore :D
20:38 <@Dune> utf8 sounds annoying as hell :c
20:39 < redix_> i'm not a big fan of utf8 names but many people would like them
20:41 < ChillerDragon> ye in mods were it is allowed names are full of it
20:51 < redix_> ah... NetStringStrict uses str_sanitize_cc
20:51 < redix_> should not affect most utf8 stuff
20:53 <@Dune> just found the old lost map :D
20:57 < ChillerDragon> hihi bcs the name is "lost"
21:23 < rand> utf8 names look fine with â™¥ (at least)
21:24 <@Dune> that's not utf8 I believe
21:24 < rand> it is
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh btw i think the new menu could get a new music hehe
