20:32 < heinrich5991> what does the dilate tool do?
20:32 <@minus> the opposite of the erode tool
20:33 <@minus> wasn't that tool unnecessary nowadays?
20:33 < heinrich5991> I don't know. what did the dilate tool do?
20:42 < BeaR__> minus: it's now unnecessary due to premultiplied alpha
20:47 < heinrich5991> BeaR__: do you know what the dilate tool does?
20:47 < BeaR__> heinrich5991: yes, basically extruding the color (rgb) values
20:48 < heinrich5991> what is extruding?
20:48 <@minus> look up dilation on the web
20:48 <@minus> basically growing an image region
20:58 < BeaR__> btw how is the steam greenlight process going?
