12:31 < EastByte> masterservers are being attacked
12:37 < WolfAlex_> EastByte: how?
12:37 < EastByte> ip spoofed heartbeat flooding it seems
12:47 < WolfAlex_> hm
13:04  * minus sighs
13:08 <@matricks> kiddies
13:08 <@minus> yeah
13:08 <@matricks> tw have kinda turned me off from making multiplayer vs games :/
13:10 <@minus> if this was an actual business with a budget to defend the infrastructure it could have even been fun
13:12 <@minus> but like this there's only one thing to do
13:12 <@minus> enjoy sunday and watch some tv shows
13:15 < WolfAlex_> D:
13:15 < WolfAlex_> tv <- nothing good 
13:15 <@minus> what would you suggest?
13:18 < EastByte> I would suggest implementing a network protocol that is supported by cheap ddos mitigation solutions :p
13:19 < WolfAlex_> tcp
13:22 <@matricks> minus: watch mr robot :P
13:22 <@minus> i'm up to s2e4 or so
13:22 <@matricks> i;ve just finished s01
13:24 < Learath2> the ending of s01 kinda confused me :P
13:24 <@matricks> really?
13:25 <@matricks> the big twist was a little bit obvious
13:25 <@minus> i'm still unsure whether mr robot ever existed or not
13:25 <@minus> ^ spoilers i guess
13:25 < Learath2> yeah that also bothered me a bit
13:26 <@minus> that's what i don't like about the show, too psycho
13:26 <@matricks> spoilers incomming
13:26 < Learath2> i was binging it so that might have set me off but i really wasnt sure what was real what was not in the end
13:27 <@matricks> mr robot was his father who died and trough out the series, it's either elliot or just a figment of his imagitnation
13:27 <@matricks> the whole story of s01 is basically fight club
13:27 <@matricks> psycho dude has two personallitys and starts a club/gang to bomb the banks
13:28 <@matricks> I picked up on that elliot and mr robot was the same guy in like episode 2 or something
13:28 < Learath2> what gave it away for you ?
13:28 <@matricks> interactions between the characters
13:29 <@matricks> of elliot and mr robot was in a room with other people, mr robot was quiet
13:29 <@matricks> and mr robot showing up at the middle of his office
13:29 <@matricks> etc etc
13:29 < Learath2> i caught up on that around e05
13:30 <@matricks> and everyone was saying how elliot was the key
13:30 <@matricks> when mr robot obviously was the key
13:50  * tokage had to vomit after the first episode
13:50 < tokage> especially the very beginning about for, completely wrong
13:51 < tokage> >I hacked your onion hidden service through the exit node I control
13:51 < tokage> s/for/tor/
13:54 < tokage> See http://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/8636/is-the-rons-coffee-tor-related-hack-technically-possible-in-episode-1x01-of-m
13:54 < EastByte> tokage: maybe he used his own exit-node to re-enter the tor network and then he used a 0day to hack the hidden service
13:55 < tokage> EastByte: exit nodes have nothing to do with hidden services...
13:55 < EastByte> yes, I know
13:55 < tokage> Even if you're not an expert, you should know this
13:57 < tokage> And I guess they made even more mistakes
13:57 < tokage> Haven't watched much of it though because of that
14:06 < EastByte> the attack stopped
14:10 < tokage> teeworlds 0.7 when?
14:10 < WolfAlex_> never
14:11 <@minus> when it's done
14:11 < WolfAlex_> (never)
14:11 < EastByte> ^ don't be so negative wolf
14:11 < tokage> spoofing is not possible with 0.7 right?
14:11 < EastByte> the new protocol should prevent it, yes
14:11 < tokage> nice
14:12 < WolfAlex_> EastByte: tw 0.7 is iirc more modunfriendly than 0.6 already is
14:15 < EastByte> yep
14:33  * matricks sends off a package to malta
15:13 < Fels> oink
15:16 < BotoX> he's back :o
15:35 < Fels> o.o
21:33 < magneticduck> does anybody play teeworlds with a tablet?
21:47 < tokage> no
21:54 < tokage> nobody plays teeworlds with a fucking tablet
22:02 <@minus> no need for swearing
22:06 < tokage> well you can get an otg cable and a hub to attach a mouse and a keyboard, but then you could have also played on your desktop...
22:48 < qwebirc92870> servers down again?
22:50 <@minus> looks like it
22:51 < qwebirc92870> may be we can add official master server for specific country?
22:51 < qwebirc92870> to reduce the load
22:52 <@minus> wouldn't help
22:52 < qwebirc92870> why?
22:53 < EastByte> we can't add another master, all 'slots' are in use
22:54 < qwebirc92870> so add the "slots" =D
22:55 < EastByte> requires client modification
22:55 < qwebirc92870> it's a pity(
23:01 < qwebirc92870> so we can add only "local" master server for our country? 
23:01 < qwebirc92870> with manual edit configs
23:02 < EastByte> unfortunatly that's not so easy
23:03 < magneticduck> tokage: I mean, a wacom tablet
23:03 < qwebirc92870> Yes) I can not even compile(
23:03 < magneticduck> a graphics tablet of some sort
23:04 < EastByte> using a pencil?
23:04 <@minus> better keep that to osu
23:04 <@minus> a gamepad might work better than that
23:07 < qwebirc92870> thx for info, I will think)
23:40 < rand> Someone dreamed about dht server list here
23:46 < tokage> it's useless without a blockchain
