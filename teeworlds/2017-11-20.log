21:30 < pinkieval> great, another ddos
21:30 < pinkieval> any suggestions as to what I can do to mitigate a ddos against teeworlds?
21:55 < minus> find something else to do
21:59 <@heinrich5991> what is being DoSed?
21:59 <@heinrich5991> is it network-bound or cpu-bound?
21:59 <@heinrich5991> if it's the latter, try finding out the vulnerable pieces of code
21:59 <@heinrich5991> if it's the former, try talking to your provider
22:17 < pinkieval> heinrich5991: network-bound
22:17 <@heinrich5991> [21:59:34] <@heinrich5991> if it's the former, try talking to your provider
22:17 < pinkieval> I don't know how the provider could block these packets
22:17 <@heinrich5991> about mitigations :)
22:17 < pinkieval> they are crafted like legitimate teeworlds packets
22:17 <@heinrich5991> how do you know it's network-bound, btw?
22:17 < pinkieval> because I looked at htop
22:17 <@heinrich5991> what did it say?
22:18 < pinkieval> that the cpu is not fully used
22:18 <@heinrich5991> tw is single-threaded
22:18 < pinkieval> I know
22:20 <@heinrich5991> dunno what htop shows, but perhaps it's the total cpu usage
22:20 < pinkieval> it shows usage per core
22:21 < pinkieval> h√πm
22:21 < pinkieval> hmm *
22:22 < pinkieval> now that I think about, there are warnings in the tty about the connection table being too big
23:30 < Stitch626> you cannot really mitigate those attacks
23:30 < Stitch626> not without loosing something
23:31 < Stitch626> the best you can do, is to ignore it. I'm mostly away when it happens so idc
