07:45 <@minus> correct, Stitch626
13:31 < ACTom> Hello, what's wrong with teeworlds internet list?
13:34 < ACTom> A lot of servers shows name is "skypename: david-lore"
13:34 < EastByte> yep, some scriptkiddie is faking the serverlist
13:37 < ACTom> But
13:37 < ACTom> Those server is normal
13:37 < ACTom> I can see then correct in favorites list
13:38 < ACTom> then=>them
13:38 < EastByte> yes, it only works when you request the whole 'internet' serverlist
13:39 < ACTom> So teeworlds master is broken?
13:39 < EastByte> no, some scriptkiddie is spoofing serverinformation once you request the whole list
13:39 < EastByte> his server fakes the information of other servers
13:40 < EastByte> it's 78.31.65.93 btw. if anyone wants to make an abuse report
13:40 < EastByte> minus: well, a masterban would fix the problem aswell
13:41 < ACTom> why he can change other server's information in teeworlds master server?
13:41 < EastByte> it's a weakness in the mastersrv protocol, anyone can do that via ip spoofing
13:44 < ACTom> 0.0
13:45 <@minus> EastByte: opprtunistically sent fwcheck responses?
13:45 <@minus> (from spoofed ips)
13:46 <@minus> doesn't the protocol include some token?
13:46 < EastByte> an 8bit token that only changes once you click refresh (afaik)
13:46 <@minus> i see
13:47 <@minus> oh, i see
13:47 < EastByte> 78.31.65.93 responses to 'gie3' using a lot of fake 'inf3' responses
13:47 <@minus> it's not filling the master server with junk it's spamming the clients
13:47 <@minus> well, banned
13:48 <@heinrich5991> thanks
18:46 < Stitch626> and what yesterday happend? was it rly ddos?
18:55 < BotoX> didn't know myLoc doesn't filter spoofing source address...
21:43 < goo> is there a masterserver down? cant see many of the servers
