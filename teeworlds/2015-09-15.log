01:25 < heinrich5991> haha, look at these images: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1402
01:30 < eeeee> that's just surround experience, looks legit. he should try it in oculus next
01:31 < BotoX> When I did that I used the zoom function in sushis client to zoom out lol
01:49 < BotoX> umm
01:49 < BotoX> why am I getting fatal error: SDL.h: No such file or directory when I try to compile teeworlds
01:49 < BotoX> yeah, sdl and sdl2 are installed
01:49 < heinrich5991> BotoX: bam -c config, try again
01:49 < BotoX> indeed
01:49 < BotoX> hah
01:50 < heinrich5991> (teeworlds bam.lua is incompatible between the versions)
04:05 < BotoX> this is seriously amazing https://p.botox.bz/cezi
05:11 < BotoX> hmm
05:12 < BotoX> How do I create an object in another object to have the same scope as that object
05:12 < BotoX> I can't put it in the class declaration else I will end up in an include loop
05:16 < BotoX> "circular dependencies / incomplete types"
05:27 < BotoX> moving the function definitions out of the .h file is a good idea, thanks stackoverflow :p
05:28 < BotoX> (stuff like Bla() const { return a->bla; })
06:12 < allu2> Hmm the reading of process memory sounds interesting, perhaps I could dive bit deeper with TeeBot and have it snoop the memory of server instead of econ logs 8)
06:13 < allu2> (as long as I don't edit anything simply reading server memory should be ok, right? I'd still only use econ to actually interact with players/server )
06:23 < allu2> Then again probably would be easier to use tcpdump or similar and analyze the traffic
