02:04 < scootergrisen> How do i change a translation and test it in the game?
02:04 < scootergrisen> It seem the game is using json files for translations
02:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> in order to contribute translations, head to transifex
02:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> in order to edit translations and see them ingame, it's the json files
02:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://www.transifex.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/
02:05 < scootergrisen> Can i up the PO or MO file? Or how do i convert it to the json file?
02:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's explained here https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-translation/wiki
02:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can get the .po files from transifex and turn them into .json. Teeworlds distributions include the .json only
02:06 < scootergrisen> ok thank you
02:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we only accept contributions through Transifex so we don't have to sync both ways, just transifex->github
