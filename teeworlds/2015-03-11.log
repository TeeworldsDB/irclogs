23:42 < eto> minus: yo
23:43 < eto> Makinit: where can i reach yo?
23:43 < eto> oy
23:43 < eto> minus: ^
23:43 < heinrich5991> eto: write him a forum PM
23:43 < eto> Makinit: sorry
23:43 < heinrich5991> that's the only way to realistically reach him right now
23:43 < eto> heinrich5991: no irc?
23:43 < heinrich5991> no
23:43 < heinrich5991> what's your question though?
23:44 < eto> heinrich5991: i can wait till he connects - or rather he never goes here?
23:44 < matricks> .lastseen oy
23:44 < heinrich5991> he wasn't here for several months
23:44 < matricks> ~lastseen oy
23:44 < heinrich5991> !seen Oy
23:44 < Nimda3> I've last seen Oy 263 days, 4 hours, 5 minutes and 11 seconds ago in #teeworlds saying "take the stuff from here https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/tree/2c4775cf5a328448ff3e81ebf781bc9fedc4f45c/other ;)".
23:44 < matricks> !lastseen oy
23:44 < matricks> heh
23:44 < eto> guys: export SDL_VIDEO_FULLSCREEN_HEAD=1 
23:44 < heinrich5991> what does that do?
23:44 < eto> i use that to shift teeworlds fullscreen to secondary monitor
23:45 < eto> on multimon system
23:45 < heinrich5991> okay
23:45 < eto> it messes mouse calculations though
23:45 < eto> so mouse wants to return place between the two monitors
23:46 < eto> i think issue is xinerama, nvidia's multimon implmentation on unix
23:46 < eto> do you think this would be fixable?
23:46 < matricks> twinview is nividias multimon stuff
23:46 < eto> i have other SDL game (octaforge and that works fine) without var even but i think it uses sdl2
23:47 < heinrich5991> the plan for 0.7 is to use SDL
23:47 < heinrich5991> 2
23:47 < eto> point is sdl blows up on multimon
23:47 < eto> heinrich5991: but that is far far away righty?
23:47 < heinrich5991> yes
23:47 < eto> should i bug oy if i want this fixed soonish?
23:48 < heinrich5991> you can try
23:48 < eto> seems like he is active commiter according to github
23:48 < eto> heinrich5991: roger 
23:48 < eto> ty guys
23:48 < heinrich5991> (but please also create an issue if you can, so it won't get lost)
23:49 < eto> heinrich5991: will do
23:49 < heinrich5991> thanks
