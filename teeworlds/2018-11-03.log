00:04 < Dune> heinrich5991: still got those transifex logins somewhere? I'm afraid translations take a bit of time and oy's prototyping the server browser tomorrow :|
00:05 <@heinrich5991> Dune: oh yea, can set that up
00:05 < Dune> oh, thanks :)
00:05 < Dune> please do
00:05 <@heinrich5991> (been busy last week, if you tried contacting me, haven't looked at my email backlog or logged into discord yet)
00:06 < Dune> I guessed so, everything is fine, no emergency
00:06 < Dune> so no worries ^^
00:06 < Dune> just the translations :p
00:58 < breton> so... after one of these attacks my server stopped appearing in the server list. And the hoster says that the traffic from the master servers is not blocked. Is it possible that master servers blocked my server? If yes, who i should talk to?
01:23 < Dune> breton: I doubt your server was banned
01:24 < Dune> but maybe it's some new mechanic I'm not awared of
01:24 < Dune> you should probably talk to heinrich and m!nus
01:25 < Dune> 0.7 is more resilient against this type of attack :/
01:28 < breton> Dune: i am concerned that it could be blocked not by teeworlds, but by hoster
01:29 < Dune> yeah that would be my thought too
01:29 < Dune> maybe you cannot receive traffic from the masterservers
01:29 < breton> Dune: because the attack on my side was ~1 gbps
01:29 < Dune> :/
01:30 < breton> Dune: that was my thought too, but my hoster says that nothing is blocked right now
01:30 < Dune> I read yeah
01:30 < Dune> tried pinging the masterservers?
01:31 < breton> all except master3 are pingable, master3 not pingable from any machine
01:31 < Dune> okay then :/
01:31 < Dune> It's not impossible they implemented some sort of autoban on the master servers
01:32 < Dune> I'm not up to date with that
01:32 < Dune> sorry
01:33 < breton> i tried debugging and it seems that server count is not returned for the servers. All servers get marked as invalid and no announcement is made.
01:33 < breton> i wonder if i can try force-feeding my server to all 4 servers...
01:34 < Dune> huh
01:36 < breton> ok, no, i can't. Maybe because incoming traffic from my ip is blocked on master servers
01:36 < Dune> sounds like that, yeah
01:36 < Dune> it's late in europe though
01:36 < Dune> you might have to try tomorrow :|
01:37 <@heinrich5991> if it is, it's probably done by some attack prevention by the hosting providers of the masterservers
01:37 <@heinrich5991> I'm not aware of any sort of intelligent blacklisting done by the actual masterservers
01:37 <@heinrich5991> yes, it's broken. 0.7 is less broken
01:42 < breton> could you please give me some pointers to how it was fixed in 0.7?
01:44 < Dune> change in protocol
01:44 <@heinrich5991> connectionless packets need a challenge-response before anything else than the response of the challenge-response is sent back
01:44 < Dune> makes reflection attack less effective
01:45 < Dune> "In addition to that fix, the 0.7 connection protocol partially fixes the server browser reflection attack, albeit 1:1 reflection is still possible in 0.7.0 with token request packets." from the blog
01:45 <@heinrich5991> that means you cannot make the master server send a server list (pretty large) to a spoofed IP address anymore
01:50 < breton> commit id please
01:50 < Dune> this cannot be fixed without upgrading to 0.7 though
01:50 < Dune> since it's a change in protocol
01:53 < Dune> 0.6.5 fixes what can be without a protocol change
01:55 <@heinrich5991> pff.. hold my beer
01:55 <@heinrich5991> 0.6.6 can have a http master server, too
01:56 <@heinrich5991> breton: most of the stuff was done in https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/986
01:56 <@heinrich5991> but there were a lot of subsequent fixes
01:57 < Dune> looks like a crapton of work; thanks, heinrich5991
01:58 <@heinrich5991> oh god, that was 6 years ago
01:58 <@heinrich5991> I better not look at my younger self's code
01:58 < Dune> haha I know the feeling
01:58 < Dune> let's not even talk about old forum posts
01:59 <@heinrich5991> hmmm
01:59 < breton> +2,711 −995
01:59 <@heinrich5991> 20 bit token
01:59 < breton> nice change though :)
02:00 <@heinrich5991> maybe I should have picked a higher bit count back then
02:00 <@heinrich5991> 0.6.5 has 32 bit tokens
02:02 <@heinrich5991> hmm. if you know someone's IP address, you can force them out of the game :(
02:02 <@heinrich5991> you need to send 1MB/byte of the packet you want to spoof
02:02 <@heinrich5991> so around 50MB or so for a connection close packet
02:03 <@heinrich5991> 200GB in teeworlds 0.6.5
02:03 <@heinrich5991> halve that for the expected value
02:15 <@heinrich5991> Dune: transifex's strings are up-to-date now
02:19 <@heinrich5991> Dune: if you want to have access to anything there, give me a ping on the forums
02:19 < Dune> okay
02:20 < Dune> done
02:21 <@heinrich5991> hmmm. definitely social-engineerable.. good enough I guess
02:21 <@heinrich5991> what's your account on transifex?
02:23 <@heinrich5991> Dune: ^
02:23 < Dune> haha, you're right
02:23 < Dune> hold on
02:23 < Dune> Dunedune heinrich5991
02:24 <@heinrich5991> We were unable to find this user. You can enter their email and invite them to create a Transifex account. 
02:24 <@heinrich5991> nevermind, seems to have worked
02:25 <@heinrich5991> you should have access to everything now
02:25 <@heinrich5991> btw, for mi*nus to add you to this channel, you need to have a Q account and be logged in
02:25 <@heinrich5991> I thought I saw you logged in before, but maybe I misremember
02:40 < Dune> thanks heinrich5991, it works
02:40 < Dune> huh, I'm not logged in? I think I am
02:40 < Dune> yeah, I am now
02:44 < Dune> ./msg Q AUTH Dune ****
10:19 < breton> eh nothing got fixed through the night
10:24 <@heinrich5991> hm?
10:33 < breton> my issue with master servers not responding to SERVERBROWSE_GETCOUNT
10:39 <@heinrich5991> oh
10:47 < breton> or to any other packet
11:43 < breton> no really though, this sucks. I could ask for a new ip from my hoster, but this is not sustainable, because i cannot ask for new ips after every attack
13:14 < Dune> sorry breton :/ do you think the masterservers host banned your host IP?
16:39 < koomi> you can check if you're listed in https://www.teeworlds.com/master-bans.cfg
17:28 < breton> nope, not listed in master-bans.cfg
17:29 < Dune> but it could be that the *host* of the masterservers banned yours, ofc :|
17:29 < breton> Dune: yes, but master2 and master3 have different hosts, right?
17:31 < breton> or should i expect an answer only from one of them?
17:40 < Dune> huh?
17:40 < Dune> well like you said master3 is not pingable
17:44 < breton> but it seems to be up according to https://status.tw/?p=status . It is not pingable from any machine. I think they just disable ICMP responses :)
17:47 < Dune> I think masters3 is down or something, I suggest to ignor
17:47 < Dune> e
17:51 < Learath2> breton: here?
17:58 < Learath2> Dune: master3 is alive btw
17:58 < Learath2> I'm guessing they just block icmp
18:01 < breton> Learath2: yes
18:02 < Learath2> breton: is your server on linux?
18:02 < breton> Learath2: yes, debian 9
18:02 < Learath2> Can you try `echo -en "\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xffreq2" | nc -u master4.teeworlds.com 8300 | hexdump`?
18:02 < Learath2> I'll watch from this side
18:03 < breton> ran it
18:03 < Learath2> got anything back?
18:03 < breton> no
18:03 < Learath2> I didn't get your packet either :/
18:04 < Dune> Learath2: oh, didn't know
18:05 < breton> Learath2: lol
18:05 < breton> Learath2: 31.186.251.128 is in frankfurt?
18:05 < Learath2> breton: yep
18:05 < Learath2> breton: What is your server ip?
18:06 < breton> Learath2: i think we are in the same datacenter, 95.172.92.194
18:06 < breton> Learath2: (i actually chose them because ddnet is there)
18:07 < Learath2> master4.teeworlds.com is ddnet.tw :)
18:08 < Learath2> breton: can you send another one?
18:08 < breton> Learath2: done, got a huge reply
18:08 < Learath2> okay I see the packet arriving and the master replying
18:09 < Learath2> try registering with master4
18:11 < breton> yey!
18:11 < breton> [5bddd6a8][register]: chose 'master4.teeworlds.com' as master, sending heartbeats
18:11 < breton> server registered
18:12 < Learath2> seems to be replying properly, beware though master4 does sometimes decide to block master server packets if the flood does get too intense
18:12 < breton> Learath2: thank you!
18:38 < SilverMage-HUN> hey :D
18:38 < Learath2> Hi
18:39 < SilverMage-HUN> I'm actually new to this channel
18:39 < breton> SilverMage-HUN: hi
18:39 < SilverMage-HUN> what's usually going on here?
18:39 < SilverMage-HUN> breton: pfff
18:39 < Learath2> some development talk, some troubleshooting, some brainstorming
18:40 < SilverMage-HUN> I see
18:40 < Learath2> most of the time silence (albeit it's been more active last couple weeks)
18:41 < rand> we are playing idle game
18:41 < SilverMage-HUN> actually I know about this channel from discord :D
18:41 < SilverMage-HUN> the messages here are automatically displayed on the general tw discord server
18:44 < rand> so our privacy is again threaten, it's fine 
18:44 < SilverMage-HUN> :D
18:44 < SilverMage-HUN> kinda
18:44 < SilverMage-HUN> but I think no one else reads them rly
18:45 < SilverMage-HUN> maybe noby
18:45 < rand> oh, privacy is about discord©
18:46 < Learath2> discord is logging our super secret conversations for nsa agents to analyze later
18:46 < rand> where is matrix.org when we need it ? :3
18:47 < SilverMage-HUN> I haven't heard of this matrix.org before lol
18:47 < SilverMage-HUN> but I searched it and it sounds great
18:48 < rand> IRC will survive them all
18:48 < SilverMage-HUN> ok
18:49 < rand> but it's nice to try, as long as it's open source
18:51 < Learath2> irc definitely needs some upgrades :P
18:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> SilverMage-HUN: i am watching you guys o.O not just noby. And probably some others do it aswell
19:00 < SilverMage-HUN> ChillerDragon: why can't I write in that dc channel lol
19:00 < SilverMage-HUN> ah you have this two-way rank
19:00 < SilverMage-HUN> how can I get that :D
19:02 < SilverMage-HUN> I can probably ask heinrich
19:04 < SilverMage-HUN> and vali is reading too btw
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yep ask heinrich. Wow this matrix.org look hughe. But i don't get it xd
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But i am somehow interested in it. Probably worth doing some research on it
19:10 < SilverMage-HUN> kk
19:11 < breton> wow, new interesting attack on 0.6.4
19:11 < breton> let me verify first though
19:12 < SilverMage-HUN> is there a new attack?
19:12 < SilverMage-HUN> or is it the one w the code-named bots
19:14 < breton> ok, no, nevermind
19:14 < SilverMage-HUN> :D
