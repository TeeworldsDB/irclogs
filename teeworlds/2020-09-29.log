16:41 < MalwareTele14> hi 
16:42 < MalwareTele14> hi Dune
16:45 < MalwareTele14> is anyone here
16:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> get discord ..
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there are 200 people online on discord
17:51 < minus> punbb updated btw
17:54 < minus> Dune, heinrich5991: installed a post & registration approval extension
18:01 < minus> it's available in the admin area (2 tabs at the top)
18:02 < Dune> minus: yo awesome
18:04 < minus> updating is a lot easier if you don't do it in a dumb way; locally downloaded punb 1.4.4 and 1.4.5 run a diff between them and apply said diff on the server
18:05 < minus> weird thing tho, 1.4.5 is not on punbb's github
18:05 < Dune> sounds smart
18:07 <@heinrich5991> nice, thanks
18:08 < Dune> heinrich5991: any preference on how to go about this? validate users? validate posts?
18:50 <@heinrich5991> Dune: I can't find what they do
18:50 <@heinrich5991> is it only posts by new users that we have to approve?
18:51 < ChillerDragon> go hire @jxsl13 to help :)
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> send 60 bucks, chillerdragon
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> why me, I wonder
19:15 < Dune> whitelisting should be less work than before, not more :)
19:27 < ChillerDragon> u seemed to be informed and caring about the forum @jxsl13 if everytime ud reported spam u had the option to validate users forum would be clean :D
19:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the stuff I wrote in here compared to th enumber of reports I wrote is like super small.
19:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> forum is kinda dead
19:59 < minus> fwiw there are settings for the extension, search for approval https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/admin/settings.php?section=setup
21:15 < Dune> I've been looking for those settings today but didn't find much except the tool to approve stuff
21:26 <@heinrich5991> same
23:51 < ChillerDragon> what about using CONF_DEBUG here instead? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/shared/datafile.cpp#L11
23:53 < ChillerDragon> rip irccloud license :/
