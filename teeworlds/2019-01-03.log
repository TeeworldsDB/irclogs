21:27 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] nheir opened pull request #1947: make sv_player_slots need a reload (master...fix/player_slots) https://git.io/fhYE5
21:31 < rand> it seems cmake files use ./data directory (like 0.6) instead of build/{arch}/{target}/data
21:55 < rand> i fucked up on sv_inactivekick
21:57 < rand> i wanted to be able to kick spectatorsâ€¦ dunno why, maybe because I didn't want a server to be full of inactive spec
21:57 < rand> it's weird
22:18 < rand> > (0=move player to spectator, 1=move player to free spectator slot/kick, 2=move player to free spectator slot/kick and kick spectator, 3=kick both)
22:18 < rand> this should be better
22:20 < rand> + spec_view reseting inactivetime
22:20 < rand> *spec_player
22:39 < rand> wonder if chatting should reset activity or not, and if it depends on player or spectator
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> if you are inactive, then you don't chat  i guess?
22:43 < rand> but, a player chatting while not playing, should he join spectator ?
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I don't think, it's our responsibility. We should kick/move only real inactive players
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> imho
22:47 < rand> well, anyone not afk can stay on a server if he want to annoy people, i'm wrong to try to prevent it, and you are right
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> you see ðŸ˜ƒ
23:11 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] nheir closed pull request #1947: make sv_player_slots need a reload (master...fix/player_slots) https://git.io/fhYE5
23:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> rand: can we still join spectators if the player slot count is lower than the actual player count?
23:16 < rand> hm, my issue totally missed the real issue ><
23:16 < rand> LordSk: no
23:18 < rand> i though this was fixed by oy elsewhere
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> what do you mean, missed the real issue?
23:20 < rand> what you are pointing
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> oh ok
23:32 < rand> what is the purpose of locking the teams ? you can't spectate unless leaving the server and nobody can join a team ?
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> The issue is simpler than that I think, if there is a (warning) message, the buttons are locked.
