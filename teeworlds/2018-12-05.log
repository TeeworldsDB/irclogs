17:28 < MertenNor> any idea what os to install on my Pi3 to get a server running ?
17:31 < Learath2> raspbian should be fine
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> +1
17:32 < MertenNor> @Learath2 Thanks! 
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I also hosted some tw servers on my kali rapsi but i cant really recommend it xd even tho it was working pretty good
19:53  * nameless_tee54 waves hello
19:58  * rand waves back
21:15 < MertenNor> so.. anyone want to help out someone that dosent know what he is really doing in linux? 
21:16 < MertenNor> trying to run server on a pi3 using rasbian: ./teeworlds_srv: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
21:16 < MertenNor> guess I need to compile it?
21:17 <@Dune> sure
21:17 <@Dune> sounds like you're using a teeworlds_srv compiled for another arch
21:17 <@Dune> so you need to compile it
21:18 < MertenNor> yeah I am stupid hah
21:19 <@Dune> no stupid questions :)
21:29 < rand> only stupid anwswer, like 42
21:31 < MertenNor> guess someone need to update this and say that 0.7.x needs the new bam version
21:31 < MertenNor> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything
21:32 < rand> > v0.5.0 for Teeworlds 0.7.0 and later
21:32 < MertenNor> yes
21:32 < rand> isn't it the case ?
21:33 <@Dune> I updated that yesterday
21:33 <@Dune> unfortunately I don't think the documentation -> teeworlds.com link work
21:33 <@Dune> correct, minus?
21:34 <@Dune> rand: it is in the windows section, which is confusing. linux says 0.4.0
21:34 < rand> oh
21:34 < rand> right, sorry
21:35 < rand> adding building information could be add to the Readme.md (/or additional file) in the repo
21:35 < rand> -adding
21:35 < minus> Dune: yes, documentation builds are bork
21:35 <@Dune> yeah there is an issue like that iirc rand
21:36 < minus> that's not something i like to fix
21:36 <@Dune> :/
21:36 < minus> mostly because it should be set up anew
21:36 <@Dune> how so?
21:37 <@Dune> rand: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1654
21:37 < minus> because it was done with buildbot on my shit
21:37 < minus> probably easier to just install a webhook on teeworlds.com
21:37 <@Dune> needs to be done. ideally add a list of debian packages too
21:37 < rand> ah ! I know there was docs somewhere 
21:37 < rand> *knew
21:38 <@Dune> isn't that more trouble for you minus?
21:38 < minus> setting up buildbot again is a lot of trouble
21:38 <@Dune> aight, I see
21:38 < minus> make a little web server that git pulls and compiles some markdown on a request is simpler
21:39 < minus> maybe i'll find some time next week
21:40 <@Dune> aight, I see. thanks
21:40 < rand> does somewone with a x86 has try the x86 linux build ?
21:45 < MertenNor> so my server is registered but I cant see it ingame
21:46 < MertenNor> port is open
21:46 < MertenNor> or it shows on local but not online
21:47 < rand> what server name ?
21:49 < MertenNor> name: Norwegian HUB
21:49 < rand> i saw it
21:50 < rand> and i see your IP
21:51 < rand> it may be a network issue, where you can't speak with yourself through the external ip
21:51 < rand> you only can use local IP
21:51 < MertenNor> yeah 
21:51 < MertenNor> so you can see the server on the list?
21:51 < rand> (i don't know, its only assumptions)
21:51 < rand> yes
21:51 < rand> i also joined
21:52 < MertenNor> try again..
21:52 < MertenNor> local server menu says that the server is 300ping
21:52 < MertenNor> join and its 3
21:56 < MertenNor> so guess the backround music wont toggle ingame? xD
21:59 < MertenNor> its in the browser but https://i.gyazo.com/c348645574f2c479492ecfdd6c44dabc.png ??
22:17 <@Dune> you mean, not 64bit, rand?
22:18 <@Dune> even in 0.6 you couldn't see your own server anywhere but in favorites or LAN MertenNor
22:18 < rand> Dune: yes
22:18 <@Dune> you should be able to toggle the background music MertenNor
22:40 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr opened pull request #1796: Fix broken key helper in callvote popup (master...fix-votekey) https://git.io/fp1SX

23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @MertenNor ^
23:25 <@Dune> why is red team so bad at survival
23:38 < minus> botox still does tw stuff?
23:38 < minus> lol i see he's banned here too
23:38 < minus> that guy gets banned everywhere
23:39 <@Dune> his forum ban expired :D
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I didnt see him in a while i think he is inactive
23:54 < rand> we played once on a iCTF server 0.7 few weeks ago
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> botox and u?
