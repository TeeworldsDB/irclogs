13:30 < BeaR_> Hi, someone knows how the channel panning in the audio interface is intended to work ? (void SetChannel(int ChannelID, float Volume, float Panning)) 
13:45 < heinrich5991> as usual, it was introduced by the large-ass commit 'copied refactor to trunk' ...
13:49 < BeaR_> thanks for reviewing my PRs btw (:
13:49 < BeaR_> Pan currently more or less used like some boolean for on/off but I doubt thats supposed to be like this /:
13:53 < heinrich5991> digging through the source tells me that it's supposed to be like that
13:53 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/e56feb597bc743677633432f77513b02907fd169/src/engine/client/ec_snd.cpp#L70
13:58 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: thx, already found that. I'm still struggling to understand the actual use of it, as the panning is already calculated by the distance of the source to the listener
14:03 < heinrich5991> matricks: can you shed some light on this part of the sound system?
14:04 <@matricks> buy a candle
14:04 <@matricks> heinrich5991: dunno actually what the panning parameter should do, don't know if I had a specific plan for it
14:07 <@matricks> heinrich5991: the sound system is so basic that it isn't that funny
17:19 < heinrich5991> I've seen some other double jump physics recently :)
17:20 < heinrich5991> you have two jumps, no matter where from â€“ when you're grounded the jump count resets
17:20 < heinrich5991> this means you either have two airjumps or one jump and an airjump
17:20 < heinrich5991> liked that quite a lot :)
17:43 <@minus> interesting
17:43 <@minus> what game?
