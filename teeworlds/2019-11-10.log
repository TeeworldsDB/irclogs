12:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> do you know that `restart 10` is broken btw?
12:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> there are issues about that stuff
12:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> countdowns are difficult
12:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> I think it's an issue that derives from the (Game-)State-Machine
12:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> what do you think about an ingame viewer number somewhere in the top right?
12:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> like an eye-symbol and a number
12:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> There are killmessages there
13:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> > what do you think about an ingame viewer number somewhere in the top right?
13:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
13:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> love that ðŸ™‚
13:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I think its awesome that you can already see who is spectating you when looking at the scoreboard. I play with scoreboard on all the time to celebrate my fame xd
13:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> There are killmessages and cl_showfps and they even overlap lol
13:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> In ddnet client the killmessages get shifted down a bit when cl_showfps is activated. Same could work with viewers.
13:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune positioning is irrelavant, i mean the feature in general?
13:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> then use the bottom right, maybe above the flagholder and the score thing
13:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't know, sounds good, gotta ask others
13:24 < rand> When spectating the flag, and asking again the same flag via spec menu, the server send "invalid spec id"
13:25 < Dune> huh
13:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea could reproduce ti
