21:40 <@matricks> okey, I got a git question
21:41 <@matricks> I have a source release of bam that I don't know which version of the source tree it's from
21:41 <@matricks> how do I search through the history to find which one it is? :D
21:43 <@matricks> found it..
21:44 <@minus> that was faster than expected :D
21:44 <@matricks> yeah.....
21:44 <@minus> i don't think there's a builtin way to do that
21:44 <@matricks> I saw that the files in the zip achive was from 2010 aug 9
21:44 <@minus> :D
21:45 <@matricks> and there is a commit on that date called "set the version to 0.4.0"
21:45 <@minus> mtime, good way
21:45 <@minus> the other way: a shell script checking out revision by revision and diff -qr'ing
21:46 <@matricks> yeah, I was thinking about that as well
21:46 <@matricks> I wondered if I could have used a bisect some how :D
21:47 <@matricks> hmm, but they are not completly the same it looks like
22:03 <@matricks> now, if I just could convert the whole codebase to C99
22:05 <@matricks> minus: btw, how have the weather in Germany been?
22:05 <@minus> today? good
22:05 <@matricks> like in general this spring and summer
22:06 <@matricks> swedens weather have been.. well. abnormal
22:06 <@minus> fairly hot in spring, pretty normal recently
22:07 <@matricks> okey, sweden is burning up, literally
22:08 <@matricks> 83 fires in sweden, which 4 are too big to put out
22:08 <@minus> nice nice
22:08 <@matricks> hot as well
22:08 <@matricks> over 30 degrees in the shade every day
22:08 <@minus> the only fire here right now is my eyes burning because redshift isn't working
22:08 <@minus> oh
22:09 <@minus> i only have ~28Â°C in the office every day
22:09 <@matricks> heh, well, luckely our offices are well cooled
