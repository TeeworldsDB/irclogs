13:13 < day> so anyone using i3 here?
13:48 < minus> not anymore
13:48 < minus> sway these days
13:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I think @Ryozuki is
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> i am using i3gaps
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> with polybar
14:48 < day> minus: ma boi! :D
14:48 < day> it was mostly about trolling chillerdragon, who asked if anyone is using gnome. :>
14:49 < day> i believe wayland doesnt work with nvidia right?
15:03 < minus> nvidia doesn't work with wayland
15:09 < day> after some googling, apparently you can enable wayland support with nvidia-drm.modeset=1 (but it seems to be riddled with bugs)
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh thanks Iâ€™ll look into it. Seems like i should switch to amd. Because I like gnome ðŸ™‚
19:46 < day> i prefer a working system over wayland ioi
20:07 < day> the only good thing about amd drivers appears to be that they are semi opensource, problem is they don't appear to be good
21:12 < kilitr> good evening everyone
21:34 < Dune> good evening kilitr 
21:43 < kilitr> Dune - this channel is not quite acitve, is it ? :D 
21:52 < Dune> moderately
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @heinrich5991 what kind of tool do you need for your http master server attempt?
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (referring to teeworlds network discord)
23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 a tool which can periodically dump all server infos would be good
23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I got one
23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but not in c++
23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's fine
23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you can do that with my golang api
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> currently started my discord bot that retrieves the master server data every 16 seconds.
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's a starting block, but not quite what I wanted from them. they already seem to have the tooling to show all teeworlds' servers statuses on their website
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yea, that sounds good
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> can you link me the repo again so I can bookmark it?
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might take a look, it's in my github repo
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/TeeworldsDiscordBotGo
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (btw, also for you discord bot, you could consider polling less often for empty servers)
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> to produce less traffic for all the servers
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I feel like that is a miniscule amount of traffic compared to one player playing on a server.
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and introducing different update intervals makes the data kind of inconsistent.
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> isn't that the same as a person refreshing their server list?
23:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what do you mean with inconsistent?
23:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I want people to have the latest data when searching for a friend check if a gamemode is currently being played
23:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> like if zCatch is empty and people wait for someone to play there
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> they check their discord
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might  be less traffic compared to them actually refreshing their browser multiple times ingame?
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yea, but they don't do it every 15 seconds, all day long
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I dunno, I don't like hitting other people's servers
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's jus browsing the server list like an ingame server browser
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> often
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> except it's doing it every 15s
