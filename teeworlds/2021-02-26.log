20:23 < ChillerDragon> is there a way to build bam verbose so i can see all compiler flags and include dirs?
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> bam -v?
20:24 < ChillerDragon> sounds good
20:24 < ChillerDragon> could also have guessed that :D
20:26 < ChillerDragon> does settings.link.libs:Add("SDL2") add -lSDL2 ?
20:27 < ChillerDragon> or probably that boi settings.link.flags:Add("`sdl2-config --libs`")
20:27 < ChillerDragon> cuz that expands to -lSDL2 on my system
20:28 < ChillerDragon> i wonder how i set a -I include dir
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> src is set as an include dir ðŸ˜‰
20:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (also just use cmake :P)
20:29 < ChillerDragon> i thought starking with bam is easier
20:29 < ChillerDragon> no idea where to start with cmake
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (cmake has online documentation)
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> `target_include_directories(${target} PRIVATE src)`
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> `settings.cc.includes:Add("src")`
20:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I found that by grepping for `"src` in the bam.lua, and `src` in CMakeLists.txt
20:32 < ChillerDragon> :brain:
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> though our massive cmakefile is very hard to navigate at times
21:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> bam also has online documentation, though incomplete
