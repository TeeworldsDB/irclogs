10:34 < Madara> hi!
10:34 < Madara> whats the variable of the players name in tw-code?
10:36 < EastBite> look at CServer::CClient
10:39 < BotoX> JulianAssange: How does that even, wut
10:40 < BotoX> I mean it constantly is sending a signal to identify itself and it's position
10:41 < Madara> thx
10:58 < JulianAssange> what BotoX ?
10:58 < JulianAssange> it crahsed anyways
10:58 < JulianAssange> everyone knows that

10:59 < JulianAssange> >DAT BACKGROUND
11:00 < JulianAssange> only time a plane ever goes missing is in donnie darko
11:00 < JulianAssange> and there's a good reason for that
11:02 < JulianAssange> So uh.. guys.. I stole an airplane.. Where should I hide it?
11:03 < BotoX> the fucking background, jesus
11:04 < Madara> You can't hide an airplane that good.
11:08 < BotoX> tfw you were in the cockpit of a boeing 777-300 for takeoff and landing twice
11:10 <@minus> average rate:     374 kB/s
11:10 <@minus> ffffffff
11:10 <@minus> 139GB to go
11:10 < BotoX> lolwut
11:10 <@minus> dumping damaged HDD
11:10 < BotoX> oh hahaha
11:10 < BotoX> I did that with 1.5TB
11:10 < BotoX> Took like 3 days
11:10 <@minus> 320GB
11:10 < BotoX> wasn't a problem since I did it on a server
11:10 <@minus> but at this rate it's gonna 2-3 weeks
11:11 < BotoX> was doing it for a friend
11:11 < BotoX> now I'm using that HDD for storing shit on it myself lel
11:11 <@minus> it's not mine. i'd have backups and would just dump it
11:11 < BotoX> yeah, same
11:12 < BotoX> time to watch some railgun
11:12 < BotoX> systemd bug is fixed in the latest package from arch
11:13 < Madara> And where is the color of the laser rifle defined? sry, but I didnt understand the game structure so much :c
11:13 < BotoX> somewhere in the client
11:15 < BotoX> game/client/components/items.cpp
11:15 < BotoX> RenderLaser()
11:15 < BotoX> OuterColor and InnerColor
11:16 < Madara> thx

12:06 < BotoX> A blus :DDD:DD:DDDD:DDDDDDDD
12:09 < BotoX> but for some reason OCSP stapling in nginx is buggy as hell
12:09 < BotoX> as it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't
12:21 <@minus> BotoX: i has F :D
12:21 < BotoX> self signed lol
12:21 <@minus> apparently it throws out my selfsigned on without SNI
12:21 < BotoX> Currently I can offer wildcard alphassl for 40$
12:22 <@minus> 1y?
12:22 < BotoX> ya
12:22 < BotoX> I am worried about my own cert though
12:22 < BotoX> wether I'll be able to renew it for 5$
12:22 <@minus> then i rather go with startssl
12:22 < BotoX> startssl is kinda meh
12:23 <@minus> https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=teeworlds.com woops
12:24 < EastBite> BotoX: as long as there is not a certificate warning I don't understand why anyone would care
12:24 < BotoX> E-peen
12:24 < EastBite> ...
12:24 < BotoX> and NSA hurr too
12:24 < BotoX> RC4 being broken etc.
12:25 < BotoX> stupid idiots still using Windows XP and IE
12:25 < EastBite> I thought the encryption has nothing to do with the CA
12:25 < BotoX> oh that
12:25 < BotoX> I mean the company itself is kinda shady
12:25 < EastBite> or wether it's wildcard or not xd
12:25 < BotoX> there have been people who got scammed
12:25 < EastBite> ah
12:25 < BotoX> wildcard is pretty important for me
12:26 < BotoX> since I use a lot of subdomains
12:26 < BotoX> https://p.botox.bz/boho.nginx
12:26 < BotoX> my nginx config
12:29  * minus steals SSL ciphers
12:29 <@minus> those better be good, BotoX
12:29 < BotoX> well, see my results
12:29 <@minus> do you have them out of that one paper?
12:29 < BotoX> I don't even know where I got the from
12:30 < BotoX> But the ones that are commented should support more browsers
12:30 < BotoX> while being a little bit more insecure
12:30 < BotoX> though they're not using RC4
12:30 < BotoX> so still good enough
12:30 < BotoX> they also have perfect forward secrecy
12:31 < BotoX> and you should really add the intermediate cert to your .pem lol
12:31 < BotoX> https://p.botox.bz/noqi
12:31 < BotoX> the root.pem for ssl stappling ^
12:32 < BotoX> openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 2048
12:32 < BotoX> for 2048 bit diffie hellman key crap
12:33 < BotoX> https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=gs.tuxhelp.org
12:33 < BotoX> and then there's this guy lol
12:35 < BotoX> Also, you can try using HHVM for the teeworlds forum instead of PHP
12:43 < BotoX> Recent Worst: mnus.de
12:43 < BotoX> lel
12:44 < BotoX> seems like the latest nginx-devel fixes the OCSP stapling
12:44 <@matricks> o/
12:44 < BotoX> time to compile nginx on ARM ;_;
12:45 < BotoX> or, eh, screw that. It'll probably take too long
12:47 <@minus> why do you have to compile it, BotoX?
12:47 < BotoX> devel version
12:47 < BotoX> I'll just use the one in the repos
12:47 < BotoX> I also use some extra modules
12:48 < BotoX> like headersextra, rtmp and fancyidnex
12:48 < BotoX> the nginx-custom-dev package in the AUR is nice, I switched to it instead of doing it myself
12:48 <@minus> what does headersextra do for you?
12:49 < BotoX> remove headers in some server blocks
12:49 < BotoX> the HSTS namely
12:52 <@minus> what's HSTS
12:52 < BotoX> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security
12:52 < BotoX> Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
12:52 < BotoX> removing this header for some server blocks
12:52 < BotoX> like http://sakura.tea.jp/
12:53 <@minus> i see
12:54 < JulianAssange> just watched Arachnophobia
12:54 < JulianAssange> >tfw itchy now
12:54 <@minus> BotoX: what's ssl stapling for
12:54 < BotoX> I am, for some reason, running PHP-FPM on my 1.2GHz ARMv5
12:54 < BotoX> You know what OCSP is, right minus?
12:54 <@minus> yes
12:55 < BotoX> the server does it for the client and caches the response
12:55 < JulianAssange> hey wtf BotoX https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=bugabuse.net
12:55 < JulianAssange> urs beats mine
12:55 <@minus> cool
12:55 < BotoX> then "staples" the OCSP response to the server certs
12:55 < BotoX> so the site loads faster
12:55 < BotoX> also less attack vectors
12:55 < BotoX> wow JulianAssange 1024bit RSA key
12:55 < JulianAssange> lol godaddy uses rsa 1024 instead of 2084
12:55 < JulianAssange> 2048*
12:55 < BotoX> top lel
12:56 < JulianAssange> min euses 2048
12:56 < BotoX> https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=cirno.eu
12:56 < JulianAssange> upstream uses 1024 wtf
12:56 < BotoX> 4096
12:56 < JulianAssange> i couldn't choose 4096
12:56 < BotoX> globalsign ftw
12:57 <@matricks> PEW PEW PEW!

12:57 < BotoX> for linux?
12:57 <@minus> yeah
12:57 < BotoX> nice, waiting for CS: Go now :)
12:57 < JulianAssange> https://i.4cdn.org/b/src/1394270443821.gif nsfw
12:58 < EastBite> :D
12:58 < JulianAssange> sux
12:58 <@minus> what'd you expect
12:58 < BotoX> matricks pls, it's cats&boobs
12:58 < JulianAssange> i did nsfw
12:58 <@minus> noone said you could nsfw stuff here
12:58 <@minus> also, 4chan alone is reason enough
12:58 < JulianAssange> noone said i couldn't!
13:00 <@matricks> and was that a autorejoin?
13:00 < JulianAssange> nope
13:00 < BotoX> 5 seconds, seems like a big delay for autorejoin
13:00 <@matricks> ð_ð
13:00 < BotoX> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
13:06 < BotoX> wow, newest nginx-devel supports spdy/3.1 !
13:09 < BotoX> http://spdycheck.org/#botox.bz
13:15 < MertenNor> " minus: Portal 2 (Beta) [Beta] "  ??
13:16 < MertenNor> anyone of you know how I can fix this: http://pastebin.com/HM3v4UaK ? 
13:16 < MertenNor> its a Team Speak 3 error.. (server )
13:16 <@minus> looks like your harddisk is broken
13:16 < BotoX> or you don't have permission to write to the file
13:17 < BotoX> read only partition
13:17 < MertenNor> I started it with sudo so it should work right ? it was the same user that created the dir and started it.. so..
13:18 < MertenNor> how can it be the hdd minus  ? other programs work fine.. 
13:18 < BotoX> bad idea to run it as root but yeah
13:18 < BotoX> try copying the directory somewhere else lel
13:18 < MertenNor> XD ok
13:19 < yemDX> the hdd is broke you gotta throw it out
13:32 < MertenNor> yemDX: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc :P

13:33 <@matricks> heh, always fun when you find youself in a youtube video :)
13:36 < Learath2> matricks: what is the right way to use mem_alloc from system.h ?
13:36 <@matricks> mem_alloc(penis_size, alignment);
13:37 < Learath2> mp_aTeams[0] = mem_alloc(sizeof Team, 1); 
13:37 <@matricks> yeah
13:37 < BotoX> system.h has a pretty good documentation, ya know
13:37 < Learath2> src/base/system.h:94:62: error: expected primary-expression before ')' token
13:37 <@matricks> 1 should probably be sizeof(void*)
13:37 < Learath2> i know but doesnt explain this
13:37 <@matricks> sizeof(Team)
13:37 < Learath2> oh
13:37 < Learath2> the paranthesis
13:38 <@matricks> the more I code threaded stuff, the more I realize that rust is doing stuff right :)
13:38 <@matricks> rust really have some nice concepts about pointers etc
13:38 <@matricks> I really hate how c++ handles that
13:44 <@minus> :o
13:44 <@matricks> :O
13:45 <@matricks> simple thing like option type would be nice
14:18 < Madara> Hmm... I'm too dumb to change the color.
14:19 < Madara> Of the laser.
14:34 < Madara> <-- not too dumb to change color, too dumb to compile
14:55 < JulianAssange> +ok
14:55 < JulianAssange> i broke my laptop
14:55 < yemDX> happy #WomensDay2014 !!!!!!!
14:55 < JulianAssange> now im on my other laptop
14:55 < BotoX> y-you too, yemDX 
14:56 < BotoX> So, are you spending the day with your waifu?
14:56 < yemDX> i do that every day
14:57 <@minus> https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=teeworlds.com
14:58 < BotoX> nice!
14:58 < BotoX> OCSP stapling 	No
14:58 < JulianAssange> ok srsly
14:58 < BotoX> Seems like you forgot something :p
14:58 < BotoX> Next Protocol Negotiation 	Yes   http/1.1 
14:58 < JulianAssange> teeworlds doesn't owrk on this second laptop
14:58 < BotoX> no spdy either :(
14:58 < BotoX> RC4 	Yes
14:58 < BotoX> now you fucked upp
14:58 < JulianAssange> inp
14:59 < BotoX> that's pretty terrible
14:59 < JulianAssange> inp_grab doesn't recognize mouse speed
14:59 < JulianAssange> thanks obama
14:59 <@minus> mh
14:59 <@minus> BotoX: should've used your cipher list after all
14:59 <@minus> and stapling should be on
15:00 < BotoX> Are you using the trusted thingy
15:00 <@minus> mhm
15:00 <@minus> i copied from your config
15:00 < BotoX> ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/root.pem;
15:00 <@minus> pack startssl root cert in there?
15:00 < JulianAssange> >implying https on teeworlds matters
15:00 < BotoX> needs to contain your root ca and the intermediate one
15:00 < BotoX> startssl is in there already
15:00 < BotoX> then it might be nginx derping
15:00 < BotoX> it seems to be buggy with the stable version
15:01 <@minus> no, i explicitly cat'd startssl's root cert into that file
15:01 < BotoX> and the intermediate!
15:01 < BotoX> OCSP response: no response sent
15:01 <@minus> mh
15:03 < BotoX> https://p.botox.bz/noqi
15:03 < JulianAssange> gonna hack u now
15:03 < BotoX> lel
15:04 <@minus> BotoX: works now
15:04 < BotoX> yup
15:04 <@minus> not sure if i should employ HSTS though
15:04 < BotoX> Do you allow non-SSL?
15:04 <@minus> as it would break linking unsecure images
15:04 < BotoX> right
15:04 < JulianAssange> minus: i have somethinf for that
15:04 < JulianAssange> https://github.com/MegaManSec/IMG
15:05 <@minus> meh
15:05 < BotoX> Rustle with it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

15:24 <@minus> CuBe_: maybe
15:24 < CuBe_> oh I should just write everything here? :p
15:24 <@matricks> CuBe_: most probably yes
15:24 <@minus> depends

15:26 <@minus> so shit
15:26 <@minus> shit shit shit
15:26 <@minus> IPS rocks
15:26 <@matricks> hehe
15:26 <@matricks> I think TN-panels are the leading cause of cancer
15:26 < CuBe_> to start helping out.
15:26 <@minus> they stole my IPS dells at work and gave me some shitty TNs
15:27 < CuBe_> Well, since my gaming days are mostly over and I study computer science. I was thinking about maybe helping the development of teeworlds. I do know a bit of coding but I am still new to working along and helping coding at large games like teeworlds for example. So In this case I'm quite new. Now I was wondering where I could start. I really have no clue how to get going in the development here or how I could be a help. So my question is ,do
15:27 <@matricks> then I'm not the one to talk to
15:27 <@minus> very viewing angle
15:27 < JulianAssange> learn c++
15:27 < BotoX> install gentoo
15:27 < BotoX> :p
15:28 <@matricks> CuBe_: your message was to long
15:28 < CuBe_> lol
15:28 <@matricks> got cut of at So MY question is...
15:28 < JulianAssange> kk http://www.scorptec.com.au/product/Notebooks/Notebooks/53401-NX.MEPSA.002-C77 it is
15:29 <@minus> CuBe_: most important thing is: get sunglasses. you need them when coding at night
15:29 < BotoX> wut
15:29  * minus np: Niklas Sjösvärd (Zabutom) - I Code with My Sunglasses at N.
15:29 < CuBe_>  ...helping coding at large games like teeworlds for example. So In this case I'm quite new. Now I was wondering where I could start.
15:29 < JulianAssange> learn c++
15:29 < BotoX> check the issues on github
15:29 < CuBe_> .. I really have no clue how to get going in the development here or how I could be a help. So my question is ,do you have advise on how to start helping out.
15:29 < BotoX> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues?state=open
15:30 < CuBe_> thanks for the advice minus, but flux does the job too ! :p
15:30 <@minus> CuBe_: pick something you'd like to do (bug, feature, mod something to your own liking) and start reading the sauce code
15:30 <@matricks> fixing bugs is usually a pretty good place to start because you learn the systems inorder todo it
15:30 <@minus> and remember: reading/getting into sauce code takes time
15:30 < CuBe_> And how should I start fixing bugs? Like is there some buglist.
15:30  * matricks likes his laptop
15:31 < JulianAssange> fuck you matricks
15:31 <@matricks> CuBe_: botox linked it
15:31 <@minus> matricks: what laptop have you got?
15:31 <@matricks> JulianAssange: ?
15:31 < JulianAssange> oh
15:31 < JulianAssange> i thought you were making a joke
15:31 <@matricks> minus: Zenbook.. U31.. something :)
15:31 < JulianAssange> nvm
15:31 <@minus> matricks: my boss has one of those
15:31 <@minus> would not buy
15:31 <@matricks> minus: slim as fuck, good battery time
15:31 < CuBe_> Yes but what do I do then. Do I download the source and then keep working on my own version till that stuff works or how does the process work
15:31 <@matricks> runs linux like a dream
15:31 <@minus> and you're fucked when it bricks
15:32 <@matricks> minus: well, mine havn't bricked so  :)
15:32 <@minus> ^^
15:32  * minus np: Volker Meitz (PRI) - Enjoy the Silence
15:32 <@matricks> CuBe_: you fork the project on github and start hacking away
15:32 <@matricks> then you do a pull request basiclly
15:32 < CuBe_> unfamiliar with those terms though
15:32 <@matricks> CuBe_: learn c++ and how git works
15:32 < CuBe_> I should probably read a github tutorial first
15:33 <@matricks> yeah
15:33 < CuBe_> well I did learn C++ yet, haven't used it much since but ye
15:33 <@matricks> and teeworlds... big.. tihi :)
15:33 <@minus> CuBe_: studying CS at uni?
15:33 <@matricks> teeworlds is a.. well.. small game
15:33 < CuBe_> well I studied at uni and then things got boring, way too little practical for me, was too much theory and I didn't enjoy it. So now I study it in .. uhm .. I think it's called "College" or "Highschool" in english
15:34 <@minus> FH?
15:34 < CuBe_> "FH"? :p
15:34  * matricks goes back to his bugfixin'
15:35 <@matricks> CuBe_: btw, some references
15:36 <@matricks> CuBe_: a xbox/ps2 game were about 200-300k lines of code, 360/ps3 games in the order of 1.5-3 million lines, xbone/ps4... well, you don't wanna know
15:36 < CuBe_> Yes I know that. But still if you are new to this kind of stuff. Teeworlds can be a challenge on it's own too !
15:37 <@matricks> CuBe_: yup
15:37 <@matricks> CuBe_: just some references
15:37 < CuBe_> maybe you could give me some information about the source code?
15:37 < CuBe_> like the global sections, or is it easily derived from the folders
15:37 < CuBe_> like, what does what
15:38 <@matricks> base == platform abstraction
15:38 <@matricks> engine == core implementation of networking, graphics sound etc
15:38 <@matricks> game == the actual game code
15:38 <@matricks> pretty normal division
15:38  * minus np: Geir Tjelta - That's the Wave It Is
15:39  * minus queued his favorite SIDs
15:45 < CuBe_> @matricks , do you mind me asking what you do besides teeworlds?
15:46 <@matricks> CuBe_: code games :)
15:46 <@matricks> and paragliding
15:46 <@matricks> games == work, paragliding == fun
15:46 < CuBe_> @matricks: really? How lucky :o How did you roll into that
15:47 < CuBe_> @matricks btw, I was asking about your job. don't know if you answered things in your free time or your actual job
15:47 <@matricks> game programming? erh.. been doing it for a long time, started with trough a week of testing it out due to school
15:48 < CuBe_> @matricks: but you do that for a living now right? So at what company ?
15:48 <@matricks> I do it for a living
15:48 <@matricks> I work at MachineGames
15:49 < CuBe_> @matricks: awesome ;)
15:50 < JulianAssange> starbreeze lol
15:50 <@matricks> JulianAssange: before yeah
15:50 < CuBe_> @matricks: One last question and I leave you in peace. Do I really need to use git or can I download github too. My friend tells me it's easier.
15:50 < JulianAssange> so you're responible for that terrible riddick game
15:50 <@matricks> CuBe_: strange question... you have to use git.. but I think github has a git client called github
15:51 <@matricks> JulianAssange: you mean the critically acclaimed Escape for butcherbay?
15:51 <@matricks> *from
15:51 < JulianAssange> no
15:51 < JulianAssange> the first 1
15:51 < CuBe_>    @matricks: confusing answer xD
15:51 <@matricks> JulianAssange: that was the first one
15:51 < JulianAssange> oh ya
15:51 < JulianAssange> not thgat 1
15:51 < JulianAssange> the ps3 one
15:52 <@matricks> moby games has a list
15:52 < JulianAssange> 2009 – The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena (Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360)

15:52 <@matricks> etc
15:55 < JulianAssange> ye u were  part
15:55 < JulianAssange> that game sucked
15:55 <@matricks> first one was better
15:55 < JulianAssange> havn't played
15:56 < JulianAssange> so did you meat vince :>
15:56 < CuBe_> @matricks: so you worked at bethesda too ?
15:56 < CuBe_> I see brink, skyrium
15:57 <@matricks> CuBe_: I work for them more or less
15:57 < CuBe_> skyrim *
15:57 < CuBe_> @matricks: define more or less :D
15:57 <@matricks> zenimax owns both bethesda and machinegames
15:57 < CuBe_> I see..
15:57 < JulianAssange> frozen moose entertainment
15:57 < JulianAssange> >dat name
16:00 < CuBe_> @matricks: I can't resist, are you guys working on the new  elder scrolls? ^^
16:00 <@matricks> CuBe_: no, wolfenstein
16:01 <@matricks> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RZ__mnyx9Y

16:01 <@matricks> or something
16:01 < CuBe_> yeah I know wolfenstein ^^
16:01 <@minus> matricks: can you get me a copy for free?
16:01 <@matricks> minus: nope
16:02 <@minus> awww
16:02 <@minus>  :D
16:04  * matricks likes that trailer :D
16:04 < Learath2> CuBe_: git itself is way more flexible
16:05 < CuBe_> Learath2: so I should just learn git 
16:05 <@matricks> minus: a bit tricky for me getting you a version as well.. you live in germany...
16:05 < Learath2> thats what i did 
16:05 < Learath2> its pretty powerful
16:05 < CuBe_> Learath2: is it difficult ?
16:06 <@matricks> CuBe_: git is a bit of a minefield
16:06 < CuBe_> Learath2: ah well, I do have all the time to learn it I guess xD
16:06 < Learath2> well learning the basics isnt even hard
16:06 < CuBe_> @matricks: Well lucky I don't have big feet
16:07 <@minus> matricks: you could just send it to my work place, that's not in germany :D
16:07 < JulianAssange> k guys suggestions
16:07 <@matricks> :)
16:07 < JulianAssange> my laptop fan
16:07 <@minus> anyway, j/k
16:07 < JulianAssange> i've like scatched the silver off the pcb
16:07 < JulianAssange> where the wire connects to it
16:07 < JulianAssange> suggestions?
16:07 <@matricks> solder on a wire between them again
16:10 < CuBe_> When I use git, I can't accidently delete your work can I, lol
16:10 <@matricks> CuBe_: not a chance
16:10 < CuBe_> Great
16:10 < CuBe_> Bit weird how it all works but I'll read a bit about it
16:11 <@matricks> it's not the easiest system to learn
16:11 < CuBe_> is it a system that you use too at machinegames? 
16:11 <@matricks> yeah
16:11 < CuBe_> well then I should learn it anyway if I want to work in the game industry
16:11 < JulianAssange> wait lol
16:12 < JulianAssange> CuBe_: are u cube from hardcor emaps
16:12 < CuBe_> yes
16:12 < JulianAssange> i used to host for u
16:12 <@matricks> CuBe_: btw, perforce is pretty used in the industry as well
16:12 < CuBe_> I know
16:12 < CuBe_> I know
16:12 < JulianAssange> he knows
16:12 < CuBe_> @matricks well I guess I'll start with git xD
16:12 < CuBe_> no Julian the "I know" was for you xD
16:13 < JulianAssange> mm
16:13 < CuBe_> didn't you got banned julian ? I don't remember why though ^^
16:13 < JulianAssange> on ddracemax
16:13 < JulianAssange> cuz i trolled tsin
16:13 < JulianAssange> not hard :D
16:13 < CuBe_> haha
16:13 <@matricks> CuBe_: git is good for source code, but isn't that useful for content
16:14 < CuBe_> matricks: care to explain any further?
16:14 < JulianAssange> binary/images i asume
16:14 <@matricks> CuBe_: git isn't good at handling huge binary files
16:14 < CuBe_> btw matricks if I'm taking away your time you should just say it ^^
16:14 <@matricks> COMPILING
16:14 <@matricks> I can work at the same time :)
16:15 < CuBe_> compiling haha
16:15 < CuBe_> :D
16:15 < JulianAssange> has anybody made a good image comparison program yet?
16:15 <@matricks> image diff?
16:15 < JulianAssange> ye
16:15 < JulianAssange> should be put into github
16:15 <@matricks> alienbrain has stuff like that I think
16:16 < CuBe_> @matricks, were you the only coder in the beginning ?
16:16 <@matricks> there is another cvs that has some features lik ehtat.. can't remember whats it called
16:16 <@matricks> CuBe_: at MachineGames? noo
16:16 < CuBe_> no, at teeworlds
16:17 < JulianAssange> there's some story of thebeginning of teeworlds somewhere
16:17 < JulianAssange> including where matricks says the sounds were recorded at some party lo
16:17 <@matricks> CuBe_: oh, yeah
16:17 <@matricks> JulianAssange: at birdie yeah
16:17 < CuBe_> @matricks: slick :p that's pretty insane that you coded all that beginning stuff
16:18 < JulianAssange> lk im trying to soldeer this
16:18 < JulianAssange> but like
16:18 < JulianAssange> it wont stick to the pcb
16:18 < CuBe_> Like, I made this bomberman game in javascript. It works but now to make everything serversided etc is a pain
16:19 <@matricks> CuBe_: I'm a fast coder if need be :)
16:20 < JulianAssange> fisted: u there?
16:20 < CuBe_> matricks: very cool of you but I think I should understand it myself too ^^ 
16:21 < fisted> JulianAssange: what up
16:21 < JulianAssange> im trying to solder
16:21 < JulianAssange> some solder onto a pcb
16:21 <@matricks> I on occatsion do some stuff demo coding... but I don't have much time for that
16:21 < fisted> you're trying to solder solder to a pcb?
16:21 < fisted> like, a blob? ;)
16:21 < JulianAssange> yes
16:21 <@matricks> paragliding takes up me spare time now adays
16:22 < JulianAssange> it wont fucking go on
16:22 < CuBe_> haha matricks
16:22 < fisted> JulianAssange: what do you need a solder blob on a pcb for?
16:22 < JulianAssange> i broke the soldrr off my laptop fan
16:22 < CuBe_> matricks: well I'm now working with "Express", I don't know if you know it. I hope I'm in the right direction with this. I hope I can make it serversided using express.
16:22 < JulianAssange> on 2 of the wires next to eachother
16:22 < JulianAssange> now i need to put solder back on and solder the wires back on
16:23 < fisted> get new solder
16:23 < fisted> flux filled
16:23 < JulianAssange> ya i have that
16:23 < JulianAssange> wat
16:23 < JulianAssange> this solder hasnt been used
16:24 < fisted> well then put the things together, heat it up and apply some solder -- or be more specific about what exactly is going wrong..
16:25 < fisted> you'll probably want around 350 degrees C (bit more if it's a larger contact or thick wire)
16:25 < JulianAssange> dont have anbything to measure it
16:26 < fisted> what kind of soldering iron is it?
16:26 < fisted> one to solder pipe fittings?
16:26 < fisted> take a pic or so
16:26 < CuBe_> JulianAssange: you still have that server?
16:26 < JulianAssange> n
16:27 < JulianAssange> fisted: http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/cold-heat-20.jpg
16:27 < fisted> JulianAssange: does it have a label saying the power rating (in W)?
16:28 < JulianAssange> 25-30
16:28 < fisted> okay that should do
16:28 < fisted> unless you're trying to solder something big
16:28 < JulianAssange> n
16:28 < JulianAssange> very small
16:28 < fisted> then just let it heat up properly, it will get to a useful temperature.  if you have a moist sponge, use it to clean the tip before soldering
16:30 < fisted> oh and protip: hold the iron on the plastic end
16:30 < fisted> :>
16:30 < JulianAssange> ye ur not funny
16:30 < JulianAssange> i've burnt myself like 5 times
16:30 < JulianAssange> and it fuckoing hurts
16:30 < fisted> yep, been there, done that, too ;)
16:31 < JulianAssange> oh shit
16:32 < JulianAssange> i think
16:32 < JulianAssange> the npower on wire has to go inside.. -.-
16:32 < fisted> eh..?
16:32 < JulianAssange> there's 5 bits
16:32 < JulianAssange> 3 of them have silver
16:32 < JulianAssange> 2 of them have nothing
16:33 < JulianAssange> 1 of the 2 are the power one
16:33 < JulianAssange> (that have nothing)
16:33 < JulianAssange> i think it had like a 'tab' kind of thing connecting it
16:33 < fisted> can you take a pic of the spot on the pcb in question?
16:33 < fisted> i have no idea what you're trying to describe
16:34 < fisted> BRB
16:34 < JulianAssange> http://imgur.com/EvnGTnV
16:35 <@matricks> wtf are you doing
16:35 < JulianAssange> that's my laptop fan
16:35 < JulianAssange> well
16:35 < JulianAssange> part of it lel
16:35 < JulianAssange> the right 2 do somnething
16:36 < JulianAssange> left 1 does control
16:36 < JulianAssange> the 2from the left are power
16:36 < JulianAssange> aka. the ones without silver
16:36 < BotoX> oh wow
16:36 < BotoX> the pad is falling off
16:36 <@minus> don't give that guy laptops
16:36 <@minus> poor laptops
16:37 < JulianAssange> pad?
16:37 < BotoX> solder pad
16:37 < fisted> JulianAssange: you ripped off the contact pad it seems
16:37 < JulianAssange> ya
16:37 < JulianAssange> i did
16:37 < JulianAssange> wat do
16:37 < fisted> that's going to be a bitch to fix, if at all possible
16:37 < fisted> you could find another pad which was connected to the same signal
16:37 < BotoX> just solder a thin wire to it
16:37 < BotoX> and slap some solder on it
16:37 < BotoX> so it doesn't brake
16:37 < BotoX> *break lol
16:38 < JulianAssange> thats what im trying to do
16:38 < fisted> BotoX: there's nothing left to solder it to
16:38 < JulianAssange> but will it work
16:38 < BotoX> the wire that goes to the pad fisted
16:38 < fisted> BotoX: that's 5mil or 10mil typically
16:38 < JulianAssange> oh so this exolains why it wouldnt stick fisted ? :D
16:38 < BotoX> and it looks like he burned that
16:38 < fisted> JulianAssange: yes
16:38 < JulianAssange> mk
16:38 < JulianAssange> so it's ded?
16:38 < BotoX> jesus christ are you soldering with a flamethrower?
16:39 < JulianAssange> BotoX: that's pure pcb
16:39 < fisted> JulianAssange: what's on the bottom side of that pcb?
16:40 < BotoX> http://www.aliexpress.com/item/LQ154M1LW1C-LQ154M1LG19-15-4-inch-LCD-screen-The-laptop-screen-Brand-New-A/1317139249.html
16:40 < BotoX> man, this sure looks like a nice price
16:40 < BotoX> and judging by the pictures it's legit
16:40 < BotoX> but I don't want to get scammed by the chinese D:
16:40 < JulianAssange> http://imgur.com/rgT8gZV
16:40 < BotoX> there's even a engingeering sample sticker on that one picture
16:41 < JulianAssange> u can see where's it's burnt through :$
16:41 < JulianAssange> :#
16:41 < BotoX> > Please note that if the item is out of stock, we will send you the universal one .
16:41 < BotoX> obviously scam
16:41 < BotoX> damn it
16:41 < fisted> JulianAssange: since there are quite thick traces of copper, you might get away with soldering the wire to those instead
16:42 < JulianAssange> the copper wire?
16:42 < JulianAssange> those aren't conected to it
16:42 < fisted> (maybe there's an insulating silk layer on top of the copper)
16:42 < JulianAssange> those are connected to magnets
16:42 < fisted> oh, damn
16:42 < JulianAssange> if u mean the 4 things
16:42 < fisted> fucking magnets, a miracle
16:42 < fisted> yeah i get it
16:42 < JulianAssange> ye
16:42 < CuBe_> what are you making julian ?
16:42 < JulianAssange> trying to fix my laptop fan
16:43 < fisted> well then you might solder the wire to the actual wire making up the magnets, if you are careful and find the right ends
16:43 < JulianAssange> i dont have any replacements from my old ones either
16:43 < JulianAssange> all are to big
16:43 < JulianAssange> so following the trace fisted ?
16:44 < fisted> no.. finding out which copper wire ended at which ripped-off plate - then instead of soldering your stuff to the plate, solder it to the respective copper wire
16:44 < fisted> (by twisting them together or so, then heating up and soldering)
16:44 < JulianAssange> ya
16:44 < JulianAssange> follow the trace and find out where the plate was connecting to
16:45 < fisted> the copper wire will have an invisible insulation btw
16:45 < fisted> poor man's way to get it off is using a lighter
16:45 < JulianAssange> kfuck it
16:45 < JulianAssange> too much effort + wou;ldnt work
16:45 < JulianAssange> cuz a fan has to go into the hole
16:46 < JulianAssange> rip in peace laptop
16:46 < fisted> ^^
16:46 < JulianAssange> i dont think any laptop has lasted over 2 years
16:46 < JulianAssange> lol
16:47 < JulianAssange> mine i mean
16:48 <@minus> remind me to never let JulianAssange use my stuff
16:48 <@minus> do you touch monitors with your fingers=+
16:48 <@minus> s/=+/?/
16:48 < JulianAssange> no
16:48 < JulianAssange> but this is the rundown for my last few laptops
16:49 < JulianAssange> last one: charger input port thingy broke off (aswell as the PCB broke.. wtf). one beforte that; same thing (same model too)
16:49 < JulianAssange> one before that: broken screen
16:49 < JulianAssange> can't remember the others
16:49 <@minus> remember: do not juggle with your laptops
16:49 < JulianAssange> thats only within the past 2 years too lol
16:50 <@minus> maybe you should get a macbook
16:50 < JulianAssange> ur funny m8
16:50 < JulianAssange> u having a giggle
16:50 <@minus> they have magnet thingies, so you can't break it
16:50 < JulianAssange> er the charger things have never usually been a problemn
16:51 < JulianAssange> just that model was weird i guess
16:51 < JulianAssange> the whole PCB snapped around it too
16:53 < JulianAssange> oh well..
16:53 < JulianAssange> i'll buy a new laptop in 3 days
16:54 < JulianAssange> http://www.scorptec.com.au/product/Notebooks/Notebooks/53401-NX.MEPSA.002-C77 thyis one
16:55 < JulianAssange> it even comes with windows 8!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!1'
16:55 <@minus> http://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/workstations/zbook-14.html
16:55 <@minus> mine comes with freedos
16:55 < JulianAssange> rofl
16:56 < JulianAssange> anyways
16:56 < JulianAssange> so u guys are safe from me for the next 3 days
16:56 < fisted> btw im a girl
16:58 < JulianAssange> fisted: i remember when i rly did think u were a girl
16:58 < fisted> did you?
16:59 < JulianAssange> back in xyz_ddrace2 demonulpierdut days lol
16:59 < fisted> collection)
16:59 < JulianAssange> )))))))))))))))))))))))))))
16:59 < JulianAssange> http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/missing-mas-plane/story/malaysia-check-oil-slicks-mysterious-passenger-who-used-stolen
17:00 < JulianAssange> k wont be back for like 3 days bye
17:00 < fisted> bye
17:20 < CuBe_> how come "CuBe" is already in use
17:21 <@minus> 'cause you're famous
17:21 < CuBe_> yeah but there is nobody in the chat that has this name
17:22 < Maimer> its all of quakenet
17:22 < CuBe_> oh
17:22 < Maimer> you can register your name with quakenet
17:24 < fisted> no you can't
17:24 < CuBe_> but what I can do is... go eat
17:24 < Maimer> are you sure fisted?
17:25 < fisted> Maimer: you can register an account with Q, but that doesn't register the nickname for you; anyone can still take it
17:26 < Maimer> right, but if you log in and then send your credentials to Q won't that force a name change to the other person?
17:26 < Maimer> I can't remember how it works, its been so long since i registered with Q
17:27 <@minus> not on quakenet
17:27 <@minus> only on irc networks with NickServ
18:02 < CuBe_> Actually git looks quite good for like every project that involves multiple people, no ? Or is it only used for large scale
18:05 < Learath2> CuBe_: i use git for every project
18:06 < CuBe_> Also if you are the only coder?
18:06 < Learath2> yep
18:06 < Learath2> as i push it to github generally
18:06 < CuBe_> ye actually you have a good point, let's you keep track of things
18:06 <@matricks> CuBe_: even if you are alone, it's good to have some revision control etc
18:06 <@matricks> so you can back track
18:06 < Learath2> yeah that too
18:07 < CuBe_> k, time to read that git book :p
18:07 < Learath2> its quite sad to see that its all your fault when you git blame tho :D
18:07 < CuBe_> But, don't you need your own  server then Learath ?
18:08 < Learath2> nope
18:08 < Learath2> you dont have to push your work
18:08 < Learath2> just commit 
18:08 < CuBe_> ah yeah, so it's just a folder on your pc
18:08 < Learath2> commiting occasionally gives you a point to go back to
18:08 < Learath2> i do have a server because i work from different places on the same project 
18:08 < CuBe_> but you just said you push it
18:09 < Learath2> i push it when im done to github
18:09 < CuBe_> is github free?
18:09 < Learath2> or when its at a point i want to share
18:09 < Learath2> yep
18:09 < CuBe_> ah cool 
18:09 < CuBe_> so you can then access it always from github
18:09 < Learath2> for public projects anyways
18:09 < Learath2> smallet private package is 5$/month 
18:10 < Madara> How to make a custom disconnect message?
18:10 < CuBe_> smallet private package is 5$/month  ?
18:10 < CuBe_> smallet?
18:11 < Learath2> smallest
18:11 < Learath2> :(
18:12 <@matricks> git is good if you develop on several machines as well
18:13 < Learath2> not so good if multiple people are pushing to the same repository
18:13 < Learath2> well it being a DCVS explains it
18:14 < CuBe_> So you can't make private projects in github Learath ?
18:14 < CuBe_> without paying that is
18:18 <@minus> yep
18:18 < Learath2> yep
18:18 <@minus> try bitbucket if you want to upload private repos
18:19 < Learath2> not as cute of a n interface but it sure works
18:19 < CuBe_> minus: +- same thing as github ?
18:19 <@minus> yeah
18:19  * minus is considering using XML instead of JSON
18:19 <@minus> s/JSON/a python script consisting of nested dicts/
18:27 < JulianAssange> just realized i can use my laptop if im sitting next to a fan
18:27 < JulianAssange> do you know what this means fisted ?
18:28 < JulianAssange> it means this: https://i.imgur.com/3JJtU6r.png
18:35 < CuBe_> Learath2 , minus, how should git treat my line endings. 1:Checkout windows-style, commit unix style. 2: checkout as-is , commit unix style, 3:  both as-is
18:35 < CuBe_> option 1 is selected by default
18:39 < CuBe_> I took the recommended, I hope it's the right one :P
18:58 < fisted> CuBe_: if you see windows-style line endings around, assume the committer was a moron and convert them to unix style
18:59 < CuBe_> well I'm working on windows :P
18:59 < CuBe_> fister
18:59 < CuBe_> fisted*
18:59 <@minus> that's not the point
18:59 < CuBe_> aaaargh don't understand this jibjabber :p
19:00 <@minus> he's saying that source code in the repo should not use windows line endings
19:00 < fisted> coding on windows.. CuBe_ are you a masochist?
19:01 < CuBe_> personally I don't get the linux hype.
19:01 < fisted> there is no linux hype (and i aint' talking about it)
19:01 < CuBe_> well amongst the hardcore coders there is
19:01 <@minus> enjoy doing C(++) onwindows then
19:01 < fisted> and i prefer the BSDs anyway, but the point is free software
19:02 <@matricks> CuBe_: it's because windows are retarded in so many ways :)
19:02 < CuBe_> what's the problem minus , lol. C++ ain't hard on windows? ö
19:02 <@matricks> CuBe_: and microsofts own toolchain is broken by default
19:02 <@minus> CuBe_: you know nothing!
19:02 < CuBe_> lol :p
19:02 <@matricks> CuBe_: don't get me started with windows, microsoft and c/c++
19:02 <@minus> CuBe_: some day you will come to the realization that doing C++ on windows is a pain
19:02 < CuBe_> Well I did some projects in windows for school and everything worked great
19:03 <@matricks> CuBe_: you do too small stuff to get into trouble
19:03 <@minus> matricks: broken by design, you mean?
19:03 < fisted> CuBe_: how much did you learn about your computer in the process?
19:03 < fisted> nothing or nothing? :)
19:03 < CuBe_> yeah but matricks, shouldn't the code you write work everywhere? including on windows
19:03 <@matricks> CuBe_: just the little application I made called bam has so many workarounds for windows problems
19:03 <@matricks> CuBe_: HAHAHAHA
19:03 <@matricks> CuBe_: no
19:03 < CuBe_> hmmm? :p
19:03 <@minus> "should". yes.
19:04 < CuBe_> You're probably all like , this cube noob
19:04 <@matricks> CuBe_: microsofts c/c++ compiler doesn't follow standards
19:04 <@matricks> CuBe_: microsofts c compiler doesn't even support c99 yet, a standard that is 15 years old by now
19:04 < fisted> they don't /want/ to follow open standards because then they might become compatible which means the vendor lock-in is broken
19:04 <@matricks> they don't care
19:05 < CuBe_> But whenever I tried linux, it's so buggy and slow on applications etc
19:05 < CuBe_> and just weird in general
19:05 <@matricks> I used windows for a very long time, now it's more or less the reverese for me
19:05 <@minus> CuBe_: most annoying problem with windows and C(++), imho, is libraries. on linux (And most other things with a package manager) you can just install the development libraries and hack away. on windows you can either download DLLs (have fun finding a version with compatible ABI) or compile shit yourself (cascading into dependencies, have fun)
19:06 <@minus> no doubt, linux is buggy
19:06 < fisted> CuBe_: the key is to learn how to use the shell.  that's not broken
19:06 < fisted> the linux GUIs are.. crap, yeah
19:06 < fisted> they are good enoughj to display xterms though
19:07 <@matricks> fisted: xubuntu works pretty well now adays
19:07 < CuBe_> lol, but don't you guys love a good GUI ?
19:07 <@matricks> CuBe_: I do
19:07 < CuBe_> Well then, mac windows are both much better for that
19:07 < fisted> GUI only looks desirable until you have learned to handle the CLI
19:08 < fisted> firefox and xterm is all i ever run
19:08 < CuBe_> and that is..?
19:08 <@matricks> CuBe_: windows is going so fast downhill in that area that it isn't funny anymore
19:08 < fisted> and i do a lot with my computer
19:08 < heinrich5991> meh
19:08 < fisted> CuBe_: CLI = command line interface.
19:08 < heinrich5991> UI is fine
19:08 <@matricks> CuBe_: my problem with windows is that there are fundamentals that are wrong with it
19:08 < CuBe_> like, for real. I went into linux and just tried to download a simple program. I did that. I opened it and it starts glitching all over the place
19:08 < heinrich5991> but the problem is that, on windows you aren't really able to script things
19:08 <@matricks> CuBe_: you are doing it wrong :)
19:08 < fisted> CuBe_: probably your mistake started with 'downloading it'
19:08 <@matricks> CuBe_: you are doing it the windows way on linux
19:08 <@minus> ^
19:09 <@matricks> CuBe_: which is wrong
19:09 < heinrich5991> CuBe_: you might have been doing it wrong. you should have installed it via the package manager probably
19:09 < CuBe_> lol :p
19:09 < heinrich5991> something like an appstore, jsut different
19:09 <@matricks> CuBe_: get the applications from the package manager
19:09 <@minus> depending on your distro of choice the package manager has 99% of application you can even think of
19:09 <@minus> (excluding some proprietary software, ofc)
19:10 <@matricks> CuBe_: downloading executables from a website is bad to begin with
19:10 < heinrich5991> CuBe_: linux is different in some aspects. just as you somewhen understood how to install stuff on windows, you'd need to relearn some basic stuff for linux
19:11 < CuBe_> Well, to be honest. I think I did download it via the package manager thingy
19:11 < heinrich5991> =)
19:11 < heinrich5991> what program did you try?
19:11 <@minus> pacman!
19:11 < CuBe_> the app was skype. It stood there as an icon so I clicked on it. when I opened it everything went wrong
19:12 <@minus> well, skype…
19:12 <@matricks> skype...
19:12 <@minus> i don't even
19:12 < CuBe_> what the hell is wrong with skype
19:12 < CuBe_> it's very good lol
19:12 <@minus> when i run it everything, including sound, freezes for half a sex
19:12 <@minus> sec*
19:12 < fisted> it's proprietary shitware and will eventually die
19:12 < fisted> and noone can pick it up then
19:12 < Learath2> and its part of PRISM
19:12 < heinrich5991> CuBe_: skype is indeed proprietary, and some software vendors don't polish their software sadly
19:13 < heinrich5991> this also means that noone can improve it
19:13 < heinrich5991> so you're kinda stuck with what the software producer gives you
19:13 <@minus> http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/571645/Really-simple-Cplusplus-code-generation-in-Python
19:13 < CuBe_> if the stuff doesn't work on linux, they shouldn't put it on there
19:13 < fisted> they don't care
19:13 < heinrich5991> skype fortunately works (at least for me)
19:13 < fisted> they care as little as the guys who wrote your OS
19:14 < Learath2> and cmon microsoft owns skype
19:14 < Learath2> they have their own OS why would they want skype working on linux
19:15 < CuBe_> Sometimes it's better to have things already done for you.
19:15 <@matricks> CuBe_: anyway, switching from one os to another takes some time to get used to, like switching between windows and mac
19:15 < CuBe_> in linux you have to pay too much attention to everything.
19:15 < fisted> CuBe_: not if you want to become competent yourself
19:15 <@matricks> CuBe_: for me it's the reverse
19:15 < CuBe_> in linux you have to pay too much attention to everything.
19:15 < CuBe_> Well matricks, I already switched from windows to mac some time ago. And that switch was easy to make and very comfortable.
19:15 <@matricks> CuBe_: installing linux on a machine with all the tools I need takes about 15-16 minutes
19:15 < fisted> CuBe_: perhaps you shouldn't get into programming
19:16 <@matricks> CuBe_: and I've timed that.. windows... erh.. a couple of hours perhaps
19:16 <@minus> CuBe_: i used ubuntu twice for 1-2 months before switching back to windows. third time i switched to archlinux and have been there ever since (2012)
19:16 <@minus> CuBe_: os x is a good alternative too
19:16 < fisted> except it's even worse vendor lock-in
19:16 < CuBe_> is ubuntu worse than archlinux ?
19:16 < CuBe_> is ubuntu worse than archlinux ?
19:17 <@minus> haven't used it myself, but it apparently is good
19:17 <@minus> well, ubuntu is different. archlinux lets me do everything myself
19:17 <@matricks> CuBe_: we can't convince you to switch to anything, it has to come naturally, and it boils down to some ideology at some point as well
19:17 <@minus> Xcode apparently is not so good though :D
19:17 <@matricks> CuBe_: comes down to how much you know about computers etc as well and what you do with them
19:17 < CuBe_> Well, it's not like I'm against it. But in my oppinion linux could use some great polishing too
19:18 <@minus> JetBrains's Obj-C IDE might be worth a try though
19:18 <@matricks> CuBe_: I would say the same with windows
19:18 <@matricks> CuBe_: windows UI has been a steady down hill for years now
19:19 < CuBe_> Yeah I agree that mac is better than windows, but I need to use windows for school that's why.
19:19 <@matricks> more and more inconsistency and bad design and some really fundamental flaws on how the UI is working
19:19 <@minus> matricks: want back windows 95?
19:19 <@minus> 3.1?
19:19 < CuBe_> But linux might need some more time to understand
19:19 <@matricks> minus: no, w2k is kinda nice
19:19 < Edible> what about wine?
19:19 <@minus> CuBe_: for UIs on linux you have a lot of choice btw
19:19 <@minus> matricks: my favorite is win7, what's wrong with that?
19:19 <@matricks> CuBe_: dunno about that one, you have preexisting knowlage on windows that you are using, if you come in with no knowlage, I don't know which one would be easier
19:20 < fisted> CuBe_:  i have a good read for you
19:20 <@matricks> minus: a lot :)
19:20 <@matricks> minus: I can take my favorite (which is just a small peice), the shutdown button
19:20 < fisted> CuBe_: http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm
19:20 < fisted> CuBe_: it deals with a number of misconceptions which you seem to have, too
19:20 <@matricks> minus: the most destructive button on the computer that doesn't ask you a second time and is waaaay to easy to hit if you are going for the small button beside it
19:21 <@matricks> minus: to just sleep the computer for example
19:21 <@minus> heh
19:21 < CuBe_> Thanks fisted
19:21 <@matricks> minus: I hit that shutdown button several times going for the little small arrow
19:21 <@matricks> minus: one time I hit that button... and well.. I were going for a restart but instead I got a shutdown with 1 hours waiting on updates to install
19:21 <@matricks> YAY!
19:22 <@matricks> F U microsoft
19:22 < CuBe_> this hate :P
19:22 < fisted> <Microsoft>: shut up and bend over
19:22 <@matricks> another issue for me is that applications are responsible for moving, hiding, showing windows etc, so if an application is stuck, I can't move the window etc
19:22 <@minus> oh yeah, updates are horrible
19:22 <@matricks> that's a deeper issue
19:22 < fisted> CuBe_: the hate is there for a reason.  i haven't used windows in 10 years but still struggle with the brain damage it caused me
19:23 < fisted> anyway read that article :)
19:23 <@matricks> another cool thing, go to the control panel and double click on an icon, there is liek 5-7 different styles of dialogs that you can get
19:23 <@matricks> and a normal explorer window doesn't follow anything else in the os as well
19:23 <@minus> 'cause legacy
19:23 <@matricks> minus: ya
19:24 <@matricks> it has a hidden menubar that you have to press alt to access...
19:24 <@minus> anyone looked at the codeproject link i posted?
19:24 < CuBe_> Well I might try linux in a few years again, but for now I'll stick to my windows to keep it simple :p
19:24 <@matricks> no, I'M RANTING DAMN IT
19:24 <@minus> need to generate some C in python
19:24 <@matricks> oh, my build is ready.. gonna do some testing
19:24 < fisted> CuBe_: s/simple/painful
19:24 <@minus> hf matricks :D
19:24 < Learath2> matricks: watcha buildin ?
19:24 < CuBe_> haha fisted :p
19:25 <@matricks> Learath2: games
19:25 <@matricks> minus: dunno.. stupid microsoft console
19:25 <@minus> huh?
19:25 <@matricks> testing on the xbone.. ms have done soo many wrongs with that console it's insane
19:26 <@matricks> 360 was nice...
19:26 <@minus> uploading 150GB to xbone?
19:26 <@minus> well, it was a pretty big switch, to x86 and shit
19:28 < Edible> does skype work on linux?
19:28 < fisted> according to heinrich5991 it does
19:28 < heinrich5991> I use it daily
19:28 < BotoX> botnet
19:28 < BotoX> daily
19:28 < BotoX> all day
19:28 < BotoX> every day
19:29 < Edible> heinrich5991, what distro?
19:29 < BotoX> arch
19:29 < BotoX> it works pretty good on there actually
19:30 < fisted> $ ls -ld /usr/pkgsrc/net/skype*
19:30 < fisted> drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  512 Sep 30 15:51 /usr/pkgsrc/net/skype1/
19:30 < fisted> drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  512 Sep 30 15:51 /usr/pkgsrc/net/skype21/
19:30 < fisted> it's even in the netbsd package system :)
19:30 < fisted> wouldn't touch with a 10 feet pole tho
19:35 <@minus> should really run skype under a separate account with no permissions
19:36 < Edible> fisted, i hear the linux emulation layer for the bsds is often better than most distro's (actually runs things) so why not? not much to lose
19:36 < Learath2> should run skype in a sandbox inside a sandbox
19:37 <@minus> separate namespaces, chroot
19:37 < Learath2> Edible: i think he wasnt talking about how well it works
19:41 < fisted> Edible: i don't like using proprietary binary blobs, for the reasons mentioned before (it will eventually die)
19:41 < fisted> open standards are much preferable
19:42 <@minus> fisted: you /do/ know that "binary blobs" is redundant, right?
19:42 < Edible> "eventually" could be 10 years from now, 20? who knows. i wont wait that long
19:44 < heinrich5991> I don't think "binary blobs" will die
19:49 < fisted> minus: no, it's to distinguish them from other kinds of blobs, as for instance solder blobs
19:49 < fisted> heinrich5991: that wasn't what i'm saying anyway
19:49 < fisted> proprietary/closed standards/protocols are bound to eventually die
19:50 < fisted> together with their IP holders
19:50 < Learath2> why is osx considered a good development platform ?
19:51 <@minus> Learath2: it's *nix
19:51 < fisted> probably becuase there's a unix underneath the shiny surface
19:51 <@minus> can't be bad
19:51 <@minus> and there's package managers
19:51 < heinrich5991> fisted: that statement is so broad that it's doomed to be wrong. just say 'most' and you're fine
19:52 < fisted> heinrich5991: no, wtf.  they die /by design/ when the respective comany goes out of business
19:52 < Learath2> heinrich5991: i dont see how that statement is wrong
19:52 < heinrich5991> that'd assume that you could implement something like a closed protocol
19:53 < fisted> s/design/definition, maybe
19:53 < heinrich5991> but you can't, since you can reverse-engineer stuff
19:53 < fisted> that is way missing the point
19:53 < heinrich5991> and the next thing you'll do is to alter the definition of some stuff in your sentence
19:53 < heinrich5991> see...
19:53 < fisted> lol what?
19:53 < heinrich5991> it's a common pattern
19:53 <@minus> how do i generate code for nested C structs in python
19:53 < heinrich5991> someone makes a broad claim
19:53 <@minus> +best
19:54 < heinrich5991> someone says that broad claims are usually wrong
19:54 <@minus> *violently changing topic*
19:54 < heinrich5991> first guy declines
19:54 < heinrich5991> second guy points out a weakness
19:54 <@minus> *hoping not to be ignored*
19:54  * fisted is slightly unsure what int he fuck is going on
19:54 <@minus> *failing hard*
19:54 < heinrich5991> first guy changes definition, wording or says 'that's not what the sentence wanted to convey'
19:54 < fisted> heinrich5991: calm the fuck down
19:55 < heinrich5991> it even has a name, I think
19:55  * minus sneaks away
19:55 < heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman
19:55 < heinrich5991> minus: using the classes provided for building netcode in TW?
19:56  * minus looks
19:56 < Learath2> s/design/definition, maybe doesnt ch
19:56 < Learath2> change anything in his claim tho
19:57 < fisted> i don't think he cares at this point
19:57 <@minus> heinrich5991: doesn't look helpful unfortunately
19:57 < fisted> anyway the 'weakness' was a faux weakness, too, so i don't care either
19:58 < heinrich5991> other examples of that being wrong
19:58 < heinrich5991> proprietrary software being opened when the company ceases to exist
19:58 < heinrich5991> oh wait
19:58 < heinrich5991> that's no 'true proprietrary software' anymore, I guess?
19:59 < fisted> i think you answered your own question.
19:59 < heinrich5991> well
19:59 < fisted> besides you're talking about software, i'm talking about protocols
19:59 < heinrich5991> A cited example of a political application of the fallacy was asserting that "no democracy starts a war", then distinguishing between mature or "true" democracies, which never start wars, and "emerging democracies", which may start them.[4]
19:59 < fisted> ofc proprietary software is even more doomed to die
19:59 < Learath2> the word true was not needed there
20:00 < heinrich5991> so
20:00 < fisted> heinrich5991: try harder
20:00 < Learath2> a opened software is no longer prorpietary by defination
20:00 < heinrich5991> yes
20:00 < heinrich5991> but it was proprietrary before, right?
20:00 < heinrich5991> did it die?
20:00 < heinrich5991> (did it die by opening it up?)
20:00 < fisted> nowhere anyone claimed that there is no way to open up software or protocols
20:00 < Learath2> well ill let you two deal with this one :P
20:00 < heinrich5991> let me quote you
20:01  * Learath2 hides in his corner
20:01 < heinrich5991> [19:49:54] <fisted> proprietary/closed standards/protocols are bound to eventually die
20:01 < heinrich5991> so
20:01 < heinrich5991> quake3 was proprietrary software
20:01 < heinrich5991> did it die? will it die?
20:02 < fisted> it still is
20:02 < fisted> but besides that, you're missing the point again
20:03 < fisted> i thought its obvious to everyone involved that there is a chance of proprietary software or protocols be opened up
20:03 < heinrich5991> they might even be opened up by reverse-engineering
20:03 < fisted> that way no open standard emerges, dammit
20:03 <@minus> the quake 3 engine is open source, is it not?
20:04 < fisted> it even is illgal in places
20:04 < fisted> minus: the content isn't
20:04 <@minus> yeah
20:04 < fisted> for all practical purposes quake3 is stil proprietary, since you need to purchase a copy before you're allowed to use it
20:05 < fisted> and someone RE'ing skype and writing an open client for it will be sued into oblivion by microsoft
20:05 < heinrich5991> I guess not, but that's not the point
20:05 < heinrich5991> 'that way no open standard emerges, [...]'
20:05 < heinrich5991> I didn't claim this
20:05 < heinrich5991> I claimed that the assertion that all proprietrary software will die is false
20:05 < fisted> then what is your point of arguing that you can RE stuff, in a discussion about proprietary vs open things?
20:06 < heinrich5991> and I said it can be kept alive by reverse-engineering
20:06 < fisted> how does it /not/ die even if RE's?
20:06 < fisted> RE'd
20:06 < fisted> say microsoft goes out of business, someone "RE's" the skype client
20:06 < fisted> does that magically revive skype?
20:06 < fisted> have fun RE'ing the servers, too
20:07 < heinrich5991> check your last few sentences
20:07 < heinrich5991> for straw men etc.
20:07 < fisted> can't see any
20:07 < heinrich5991> who brought in skype?
20:07 < heinrich5991> for practical purposes, I gave quake3 as an example
20:08 < fisted> the discussion started with skype, FWIW
20:08 < fisted> what's bad at my scenario that we can't suppose it instead?
20:09 < heinrich5991> because you made a claim of that pattern:
20:09 < heinrich5991> for all x in X
20:09 < heinrich5991> and to counter that claim you can't just take any x
20:09 < fisted> actually what i'm trying to do is making sense of your messages
20:09 < fisted> therefore i proposed a practical scenario
20:10 < heinrich5991> okay, but you have to see that it's certainly possible to find some examples where your statement hold
20:10 < heinrich5991> like
20:10 < heinrich5991> all real numbers are invertible
20:10 < heinrich5991> well, 0 isn't
20:10 < fisted> i'm looking for even a single example where it does /not/ hold
20:10 < heinrich5991> but don't you see, 1 is!
20:10 < fisted> so deliver already, ffs
20:10 < heinrich5991> quake3
20:10 < fisted> okay
20:10 < fisted> quake3, content not opened up, ID software goes out of business
20:11 < heinrich5991> people use their own maps, run servers
20:11 < fisted> basically the only way to obtain q3 is now illegal
20:11 < heinrich5991> ?
20:11 < fisted> i.e. there isn't anything new coming
20:11 < fisted> you could only pirate it
20:11 < heinrich5991> there is some new stuff coming from people contributing
20:12 < fisted> they contribute to the parts of the engine which were opened, you mean?
20:12 < heinrich5991> no
20:12 < heinrich5991> they use the engine
20:12 < heinrich5991> to play the maps (or whatever) they created
20:12 < fisted> the engine is the open part here
20:13 < fisted> i think you probably see how q3 is the oddball example, not skype
20:13 < heinrich5991> the engine was proprietrary once
20:13 < fisted> maybe the q3 engine does survive, yeah
20:13 < heinrich5991> then we found an example
20:13 < fisted> a pretty flawed one
20:13 < fisted> becasue it is based on something which /was/ opened up
20:13 < fisted> it almost supports my point better than yours
20:14 < heinrich5991> let me quote your original quote
20:14 < heinrich5991> [20:01:12] <heinrich5991> [19:49:54] <fisted> proprietary/closed standards/protocols are bound to eventually die
20:14 < heinrich5991> q3 was proprietrary
20:14 < fisted> since you're paying attention so well, let me further quote myself:
20:14 < heinrich5991> q3 is maybe not going to die
20:14 < fisted> 20:03:09 <    fisted > i thought its obvious to everyone involved that there is a chance of proprietary software or protocols be opened up
20:15 < fisted> heinrich5991: your whole argument is based on something i left out because it's obvious.
20:15 < fisted> straw-men, indeed
20:15 <@matricks>  o
20:15 <@matricks>  /|\
20:15 <@matricks> \
20:15 <@matricks> damn it
20:15 <@matricks> D:
20:15 < heinrich5991> well in that case your statement is a pretty weak one
20:15 < Learath2> :D
20:15 < heinrich5991> everything is closed until someone opens it?
20:16 < fisted> heinrich5991: that's what a retard would make of it, yeah. or someone trying to missunderstand on purpose
20:16 < fisted> actually my statement becomes 'all proprietary software/protcols will eventually die, unless opened up'
20:16 < heinrich5991> well I guess at the point where people insult each other, it's time to stop the discussion
20:17 < fisted> heinrich5991: no, that time was already where the first straw man was established
20:17 < fisted> i.e. half an hour ago
20:18 < heinrich5991> you gotta give me someone who is saying this
20:18 < yemDX> me
20:18 < heinrich5991> I guess you could also say that it would be useful to point out a straw man
20:19 < heinrich5991> although, what definitely has to be said is that telling people that they have logical fallacies in their arguments isn't exactly healthy to the discussion if not properly mentioned
20:20 < fisted> heinrich5991: next time you make some claim, i will pick out an arbitrary obvious fact your claim is based on, and pretend it wasn't implied.  then i will use that to point out how flawed your argument is
20:21 < fisted> because i for one have heard that it can be useful to show people a mirror
20:21 < heinrich5991> I usually don't make universal claims, because they tend to be wrong :)
20:22 < fisted> that is a universal claim
20:22 <@matricks> lol
20:22 < heinrich5991> usually
20:22 < heinrich5991> tend
20:22 < heinrich5991> ....
20:23 < fisted> yeah you tried to conceal it with those weasel words :)
20:23 <@matricks> lol
20:24 <@matricks> someone is butt hurt over the south park game: http://i.imgur.com/l7pp3uQ.png
20:24 < Learath2> well definately not a great game but doesnt deserve that comment either
20:25 < heinrich5991> fisted: I didn't make it a universal claim on purpose. because I guess sooner or later I made some universal statement
20:25 <@matricks> havn't played it yet
20:25 <@matricks> seems great to me
20:25 <@matricks> I don't have any spare time at the moment
20:25 < heinrich5991> fisted: it's very tempting to just insult you, but see how I don't do it
20:25 < heinrich5991> fisted: then check what you've written and see that it's sometimes a bit harsh when read out
20:26 < Learath2> well i didnt watch southpark maybe thats why i didnt really get it 
20:27 < Learath2> games that have stories is good 
20:27 < Learath2> i like playing ESO or diablo 
20:28 <@matricks> Learath2: lol, if you don't watch south park, that game isn't for you more or less it seems
20:28 < fisted> heinrich5991: sorry for the insult, i know i can get offensive when pissed off.  but i think i was pissed off with good reason.  and i'm not sure if insulting really is worse than (what appears to be) missunderstanding on purpose in the way you seemed to do.
20:28 <@minus> python dicts are funny
20:28 <@minus> the order you get items from them is random
20:28 < heinrich5991> minus: undefined is the word you're looking for :)
20:29 <@minus> last time i checked python dicts were sorted
20:29 < Learath2> matricks: thats what i told my friends but they were like w/e game is good even if you dont watch south park
20:29 < Learath2> btw one less s in misunderstanding
20:30 <@matricks> Learath2: I guess it plays on the characters pretty much and you have to know them from what I've seen, otherwise many jokes etc might go over your head
20:30 < fisted> heinrich5991: i got mad when you started that rant, about me changing the meaning of something i said (which i didn't even do!)
20:30 < fisted> and you were all smug about it
20:30 < fisted> that's the sort of behaviour which easily makes me mad
20:30 < EastBite> matricks: that's right
20:31 <@matricks> fisted, heinrich5991: stahp, both of you know, you are not going to get anywere
20:31 < fisted> matricks: it's fine
20:31 < EastBite> there are so many references to the movie
20:31 <@minus> how could a shouthpark game not be offensive
20:31 < fisted> this isn't the first such discussion between heinrich5991 and me by a long shot ;)
20:31 <@minus> it's southpark after all
20:31 <@minus> the definition of politically incorrect
20:31 < Learath2> uhm that was more a war then a discussion actually
20:32 <@matricks> minus: yeah, the thing with south park is that you have to read the subtext in the episodes etc
20:32 <@minus> "social commentary" you say
20:32 <@matricks> yeah
20:32 <@matricks> south park isn't racist, cartman is :)
20:33 <@minus> never watched it much
20:33 < Learath2> out of 10 how good is the show ?
20:33 <@matricks> Learath2: 10 for me
20:33 <@matricks> I love it
20:33 < Learath2> should watch
20:33 <@matricks> it changes a bit of character through time
20:34 <@matricks> one of the problems of watching it late is that most episodes are pretty current
20:34 < heinrich5991> fisted: the point of a discussion is kind of to never get mad. both people should be trying
20:34 <@matricks> some of them is about something that happend last week etc
20:34 < Learath2> you should try the debate format less time to get mad 
20:34 <@matricks> or.. last night
20:34 < Learath2> well cant just start from the end can i 
20:35 <@minus> anything i need to escape in C strings, besides "?
20:35 < Learath2> there probably is a backstory  in it
20:35 <@matricks> minus: \
20:35 <@matricks> Learath2: a bit yeah
20:35 <@minus> oh right
20:35 <@minus> actually
20:35 <@minus> mhh
20:35 <@matricks> Learath2: all episoes are watchable online, depending on where you live
20:35 <@minus> turkey? probably not
20:36 <@minus> germany? sure
20:36 <@matricks> sweden have access to the later episodes
20:36 < Learath2> if there is a regional block we prolly dont have it :D
20:36 <@minus> proxify!
20:36 < Learath2> noone likes us 
20:36 <@matricks> Learath2: later episodes doesn't have, it depends on distribution deal I guess
20:36 < Learath2> especially after that weird law 2 weks ago
20:36 <@minus> string_default = "strcpy({name}, \"{value}\");" wee
20:36 <@matricks> Learath2: I guess older stuff has some other old distribution deals
20:37 < heinrich5991> minus: make sure that name is long enough to hold value
20:37 <@minus> good point
20:37 < fisted> heinrich5991: i can't help but get mad when someone pulls off a stunt like you did in said monologue.  if doing that is okay in a discussion, getting mad certainly must be okay too..
20:37 < heinrich5991> or use a safe function ^^
20:38 <@minus> nay, that should be checked at generation time
20:39 < heinrich5991> getting mad is okay and will probably happen
20:39 <@matricks> Learath2: first seasons are offensive and poop jokes but as the show progresses it gets into the social satire and then it gets really good
20:39 < heinrich5991> the problem starts when you do things out of your madness
20:39 < Learath2> wow i can actually watch s01e01 :D
20:39 <@matricks> :)
20:40 <@matricks> cartman gets an anal proble
20:40 <@matricks> *probe
20:40 < Learath2> should watch when the update is done 
20:40 < fisted> heinrich5991: but if the madness is provoked by the discussion partner, he kind of deserves what he gets in return.
20:41 < fisted> right.
20:42 <@minus> matricks: slightly trigger happy?
20:43 <@matricks> hyhyhyhyhyhy
20:45 <@matricks> :P
20:46 <@minus> i don't need your invitations!
20:46 <@matricks> :o)

20:59 < BotoX> http://www.panelook.com/popularmodels.php?id=10169
20:59 < BotoX> someone pls help
20:59 < BotoX> I have a LTN154U2-L05 in my laptop
20:59 < BotoX> want to swap it out for a LQ154M1LW1C from SHARP
21:00 < BotoX> the LQ154M1LW02 is known to be compatible and some of the LG ones
21:00 < BotoX> I guess the LQ154M1LW1C should be compatible too then?
21:03 <@minus>     if (v.signed and not -2**(v.bits-1) <= v.default <= 2**(v.bits-1)-1) or\
21:03 <@minus>      (not v.signed and not 0 <= v.default <= 2**v.bits-1):
21:03 <@minus> very compact bounds checking :D
21:04 <@minus> BotoX: why swap it?
21:04 < BotoX> the samsung one is crap
21:04 < Learath2> matricks: heh this indeed is quite funny
21:04 < BotoX> the sharp one has far better brightness, color reproduction and viewing angles
21:04 <@minus> well, not much brightness difference
21:04 < BotoX> http://thinkwiki.de/Besseres_Display_f%C3%BCr_15,4%22_ThinkPads
21:05 < BotoX> ignore the values on the site
21:05 < BotoX> you can see it on the pictures
21:05 <@minus> except for the top one they got bad brightness
21:05 < BotoX> and users talking about it
21:05 <@matricks> Learath2: :)
21:05 < BotoX> the top ones are dual CCFL
21:05 < BotoX> not compatible because of the inverter
21:05 < BotoX> http://www.aliexpress.com/item/LQ154M1LW1C-LQ154M1LG19-15-4-inch-LCD-screen-The-laptop-screen-Brand-New-A/1317139249.html
21:05 < BotoX> I messaged this guy and he confirmed me that he is selling genuine sharp displays in his best chinenglish
21:06 < BotoX> >Hello, this is the original sharp
21:06 <@minus> wouldn't trust a chinese
21:06 < BotoX> well, it's aliexpress
21:06 < BotoX> there aren't a lot of sellers on ebay
21:06 < BotoX> most just sell samsung panels
21:07 < BotoX> I'm more concerned about the connector and shipping/taxes
21:07 < BotoX> the pictures he put up are clearly showing that it's a original SHARP
21:07 < BotoX> it even has a engineering sample sticker on it \o/
21:10 <@minus> pulseaudio is a CPU hog, ~10% constantly
21:11 < BotoX> yup
21:15 <@minus> config.server.listen_port: default value 92301 is not within the support value range of uint16_t
21:15 <@minus> so much type checking :D
21:16 < BotoX> fug
21:16 < BotoX> should I just buy it 
21:17 <@minus> rescued:   220154 MB,  errsize:    103 MB,  current rate:    1572 kB/s
21:17 <@minus> 100GB to go!
21:23 <@minus> BotoX, matricks: have you experienced this? https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=680385
21:23 < BotoX> nope
21:23 <@matricks> nope
21:23 <@matricks> minus: running single monitor
21:25 < BotoX> Should I pick EMS over China Post Air Mail?
21:25 < BotoX> EMS is 18.71€, China Post is 10.91€
21:44 < Learath2> depends on the advantage 
21:56 < BotoX> Well, clearly EMS will be faster
21:56 < BotoX> and probably more safe too
21:56 < BotoX> Would you mark a display as 25$ gift to avoid customs?
21:57 < BotoX> Or should I just do 50$
21:58 < Learath2> no idea what the customs rule is there 
21:58 < BotoX> 25$ gift is no customs
21:58 < Learath2> but if you can avoid customs do so
21:58 < BotoX> but they might not fall for it D:
21:58 < BotoX> and then I gotta pay the full price
21:58 < BotoX> maybe even more
21:58 < Learath2> well if there is no penalty 
21:58 < Learath2> go for it
