00:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> We can use another format, let's just not use the most annoying one though
00:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> you mean xml
00:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I see no benefit to use a human-readable format
00:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you can see small changes in maps more easily
00:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> you can parse them with commonly available libs/tools
00:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> fair
00:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> if you make the order stable, you can probably version control maps as well
