15:57 < ChillerDragon> can get ``teeworlds_srv -f autoexec.cfg`` to load ./autoexec.cfg if exists over ~/.teeworlds/autoexec.cfg
15:57 < ChillerDragon> because manipulating the storage.cfg has other unwanted side effects like logging to ./dumps instead of ~/.teeworlds/dumps
17:01 < Oy> doesn't seem possible right now
17:02 < ChillerDragon> yea can we change that?
17:02 < Oy> could change the behaviour of the -f param, probably doesn't need the security of the exec command
17:02 < ChillerDragon> i mean i see ~/.teeworlds/autoexec.cfg as a global fallback
17:02 < ChillerDragon> so provide a global path to -f ?
17:03 < ChillerDragon> also a bit nasty
17:03 < Oy> make it possible to use absolute paths for -f?
17:04 < ChillerDragon> nah
17:05 < ChillerDragon> just always search the config in currentdir first nomatter what is specified in storage.cfg
17:05 < Oy> that's odd
17:06 < Oy> open an issue on github, maybe someone has a good idea ;)
17:07 < ChillerDragon> my last message is what i want not how it is 
17:07 < ChillerDragon> but yea ill issue
17:09 < Oy> yeah that would be odd, would change the actual behaviour totally, the old behaviour should still be possible
17:09 < Oy> some kinda trigger would be good
17:09 < ChillerDragon> hm
17:21 < ChillerDragon> oh Oy since ur here did u have a look at bash completion?
17:22 < ChillerDragon> (pr)
17:37 < Oy> not yet ChillerDragon
