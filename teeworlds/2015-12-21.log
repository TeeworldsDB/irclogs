03:24 < pielover88888> Yo, was saying that teeworlds 0.7 will be released on the 24th just a cruel joke?
03:34 < pielover88888> or will it be released on like, the 31st, just to keep to the 2015 promise?
03:57 < Kirbs> it was pie
03:58 < Kirbs> I'm glad it wont be released on the 24th, because I really dont think it is readdy
03:58 < Kirbs> ready
03:58 < Kirbs> judging from teeworlds-master I mean
04:42 < pielover88888> jokes about release dates shouldn't be a thing IMO
05:14 < Kirbs> dont blame me :D
07:46 <@minus> hurrr
07:47 <@minus> Dec 31 doesn't really sound realistic either tho
08:50 < eeeee> if there is no 0.7 release maybe you could at least re-release the 1.0 version from a while ago. make it a platinum ultimate collector's pack edition.
08:52 <@minus> :D
08:57 < Sadale> yay. I got someone host [N]Race revived server in europe/us. No more high ping for europe/us players :3
