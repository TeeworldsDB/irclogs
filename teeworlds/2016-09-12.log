11:10 < ACTom> hello, where can I download teeworlds's large pictures? I'd like to make a mouse pad
11:10 < ACTom> Mouse pad's size is 80cm * 30cm.
20:26 < Neox> hello! I didn't want to write in the forum, I'd like to ask a question here. So there's a guy that is... trying to screw up my servers - if you go to the server list, you can see NX|City with 16/16 where half of the players are "connecting"
20:26 < Neox> Is spoof protection useful against this? If yes, where can i find what code to add?
20:28 <@heinrich5991> ddnet has a huge hack for that
20:28 < Neox> yep I saw that but there are a lot, really a lot of files to edit. iF City coder gave me what he thinks I should add, but he wasn't sure and the old codes weren't matching with mine. Can you give me something simple to follow (on github of course) so that I can implement it? Please?
20:43 <@heinrich5991> I can't point you to a single commit or patch you have to implement
20:44 <@heinrich5991> there's some setting sv_vanilla_antispoof or so
20:51 < Neox> Well alright, I'll take a look at it. Thanks
20:58 < EastByte> Neox: you can look into the latest commits of https://github.com/east/teeworlds/commits/antispoof
20:58 < Neox> Thank you East!
