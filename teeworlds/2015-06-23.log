00:59 < Savander> for this topic on forum https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11427&p=2
00:59 < Savander> i hope you like it !:_
19:11 < heinrich5991> Savander: now I'm here
19:11 < heinrich5991> and I read your PM
19:11 < Savander> ;)
19:14 <@matricks> heinrich5991: hows the greenlight coming along?
19:15 < heinrich5991> matricks: the only missing pieces for the release are a working mac version and a trailer
19:15 <@matricks> coo
19:16 <@matricks> heinrich5991: when are you going to rewrite teeworlds in rust?
19:16 <@matricks> :P
19:16 < heinrich5991> matricks: I'm writing teeworlds map reading in rust
19:16 <@matricks> oh :D
19:16 < heinrich5991> but I'm probably too unfocussed to finish something larger (such as a rewrite of the TW engine in rust)
19:17 < heinrich5991> also, I wonder how much `unsafe` code is ethical
19:17 <@matricks> :)
19:17 < heinrich5991> because in order to deliver similar performance as the teeworlds C code, I sometimes do weird type stuff
19:17 <@matricks> dunno really
19:18 < heinrich5991> such as casting a slice of i32 to a slice of a struct that contains only i32s
19:18 <@matricks> perhaps some network stuff
19:18 < heinrich5991> or casting slices of i32 to slices of u8 to read from a file
19:18 < heinrich5991> (with an endian conversion ofc)
19:18 <@matricks> it can be isolated atleast
19:18 <@matricks> make more use of threading
19:19 < heinrich5991> yep
19:19 < heinrich5991> also, rust encourages error checking
19:19 < heinrich5991> which TW doesn't really do right now
19:22 <@matricks> which is bad :)
19:22 <@matricks> bad(tm)
19:22 < heinrich5991> well, e.g. the error message for "disk full" is: map crc doesn't match the server's
19:23 < heinrich5991> or I guess one could detect if the target udp host is down
19:38 <@minus> disk full is a horrible thing
19:39 <@minus> most programs don't handle it well
19:40 < heinrich5991> minus: you could just display an error message in TW's case
19:43 <@minus> it's more delicate when saving settings. old file deleted/truncated, woops can't write new file
19:53 <@matricks> I wish I had more time to spend on rust stuff
19:53 <@matricks> or any time at all for that matter
19:55 <@minus> ^
19:56 <@matricks> too much time spent on being awesome instead
