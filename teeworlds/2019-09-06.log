00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no, it was your client, lol xD
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> otherwise there wouldn't be a cmake in the source
00:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> when is the new map editor ready :O?
00:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> how does the gamer client recognition work?
00:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yes it works
00:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> When the assigned people work on it :P
00:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's somehow over skin parts?
00:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or their names
00:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah :)
00:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> feet?
00:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :O?
00:34 <@Dune> depends, it adapts. if you customize everything, it won't work
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ah, so if one of the parts is standard
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> your use it?
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> interesting >:O
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> anyway, goo night
01:27 < TeeSlayer> Hey. Lolinet is shutting down on Sunday. You can download all record and map files on lolinet.info.
07:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Oh damn
08:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Why TeeSlayer?
08:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> What is gamerclient recognition?
11:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think imma do a zCatch map repository, ciz there are some nice maps there :'c
11:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> cuz
13:34 < teeworlds> fokkonaut: I launched Lolinet originally because there were almost no servers for 0.7. From January to March I think I was the only one hosting DDRace, hehe. But now there is no need for Lolinet anymore and other server admins have spun up better services.
13:35 < teeworlds> jxsl13: I uploaded the .config files, too.
13:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (Y)
13:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> TeeSlayer, but there is still no good ddrace mod (except mine, lol :p). mkRace by Snoop is pretty good already, but is still missing features.
13:47 < teeworlds> fokkonaut: somebody needs to integrate a DBMS like postgresql or mysql... there are quite a few bugs with the current system
13:48 < teeworlds> even sqlite would be better :D
13:48 <@Dune> teeworlds, who are you?
13:48 < TeeSlayer> oops
13:48 < TeeSlayer> I haven't configured this irc client
13:53 < TeeSlayer> btw Teeworlds works great on ppc64le. I bought https://raptorcs.com/content/BK1B02/intro.html recently :D
13:53 <@Dune> oooh :)
13:54 <@Dune> did you get any ddos btw?
13:54 < TeeSlayer> I'm not sure, maybe it was just the provider fucking up
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Teeslayer, I could pretty easily implement MySql
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but since I dont have mysql i wont do it xd
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/PlayerRanking
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm looking for someone to add MySQl support, atm it only saves integer values associated to keys, that are nicknames.
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as I find the official myslq c/c++ library too big to be worth adding it, I didn't do it, but maybe somoene might find a better and smaller version of it?
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it supports redis and sqlite
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *cough, doesn't support bam, cough end*
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm looking for someone to add MySQLsupport, atm it only saves integer values associated to keys, that are nicknames.
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune how did you fix the freeze prediction?
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (when someone hooks you, when the fake tunings are on)
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> with fake tunings?
23:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> you know, that you dont bounce around in freeze
23:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> groundcontrolspeed and that shit
23:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if you are frozen you send fake tunings to that tee
23:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes, what about that?
23:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune how did you fix the freeze prediction?
23:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (when someone hooks you, when the fake tunings are on)
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> by having fake tunings?
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `Edit: Fixed prediction when being hooked while frozen in 1.0.1`
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> you posted that
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> look up the commit history, then I don't remember
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i cant find it
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> lol
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @TeeSlayer, where is the lolinet ddrace mod?
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune can you search it? I cant find it
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ah
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> found it
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Slayer, is it on github?
