13:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Perhaps? I'm not sure what the right implementation should be.
13:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Do people even want to play on a controller?
13:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I'd consider it
13:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I mean it's a quite good fit, don't you think? (apart from the menus)
13:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I mean yeah, but is it a requested feature?
14:07 < day> heinrich5991: i dont think it works. like imagine playing on an xbox360 controller. where do you put the actions?
14:08 < day> left stick movement, right stick aim. now where do you put the weapons? you cant put them on the 4 buttons, because you need your right thumb for them and thats occupied
14:09 < day> shooting on the analog right pointerfinger trigger isnt good either, because its not a binary switch
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> switch weapons with start like in those old games :D
14:10 < day> aiming on an analog stick is probably awesome though :|
14:10 < day> :D
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> teeworlds should implement vocal recognition so you can just say the weapons
14:10 < day> judge dredd style
14:11 < day> HIGH EX
14:12 < day> on that note. teeworlds needs a napalm thrower <3
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> for all those maps made with 1x1 unhookables?
14:15 < day> flag carriers will love them <3
14:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> more seriously, left stick movement, right stick aim, TL shoot, TR hook and use the aim finger or the shoot finger to switch weapons?
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> left stick hook, right stick fire, keypad move, buttons weapons?
14:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> > left stick hook, right stick fire
14:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but there is only one aim
14:28 < day> teeworlds 0.8 changelog: Introducing Dualwield
14:29 < day> Dune: what is TL TR?
14:29 < day> the xbox360 buttons on the rear of the controller?
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> top left, top right, with the third finger?
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I only ever used @LordSk's controller and it had a bunch of buttons on the rear
14:30 < day> thing is you cant use the pointer finger to access the 4 buttons on the right side. its painful at best ^^
14:31 < day> using the right index finger for weapon switching isnt viable imo. because the stick would snap to the center messing up your aim
14:31 < day> right thumb*
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah :/
14:32 < day> the same is true for the left thumb, if you stop pressing the direction you lose all your momentum :/
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I guess you need more than two buttons at the rear
14:32 < day> yeah, or something that your pinkies can press
14:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> or pedals
14:34 < day> yeah for left and right :D thought the same
14:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> could use a gear box for weapons :D
14:35 < day> but tees only have 5gears q.q
14:35 < day> i want 9speed dsg
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> rear is for aimbot
14:36 < day> not kidding i bet a steering wheel would actually work for aim :X
14:37 < day> put a knob on it and it would feel like a farming sim kek
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> teeworlds is already a farming sim for mario bros
14:38 < day> sec france is calling ^.^
14:59 < day> back
18:57 <@Dune> hm, I'd like to force bot countryflags to a certain value, that's probably better than changing the display of the countryflag
18:58 <@Dune> there doesn't seem to be any mention of countryflags in src/engine/client/serverbrowser.cpp tho :|
18:58 <@Dune> I guess it only builds the list of addresses?
19:00 <@Dune> I wonder if I should modify the CServerInfo :|
19:21 <@Dune> oh nvm, seems like we don't even know which are bots :D
19:26 < rand> ?
19:27 < rand> you should know in serverbrowser
19:27 < rand> I support the idea of a bot country
19:28 < rand> (and I though it was the initial topic in the issue #1390
19:30 <@Dune> rand: I think you only know the number of bots in the server browser, but I could be wrong
19:34 < rand> the server do not send this information, it send the status of each player, and that is used to count the number of player/bot
19:34 < rand> btw the filter remove bots from serverlist :)
19:40 <@Dune> ah okay, thanks :)
