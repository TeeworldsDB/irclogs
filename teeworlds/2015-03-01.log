04:24 < Edible> i just asked if you wrote that thing as a switch statement

06:52  * nameless_tee50 slaps Q around a bit with a large fishbot
23:12 < Pathos> Anybody know what program I can use to edit the wv audio files for TW? I just want to make the jump sound louder
23:15 < Pathos> Converting is fine too
23:17 <@matricks> get the original wav, change it, then use wavpack to compress it
23:17 <@matricks> converting is not fine..
23:28 < Pathos> Where do I get the original wav?
