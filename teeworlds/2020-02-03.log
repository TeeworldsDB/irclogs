00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> What about choosing a random or first best map from maps directory when sv_map is not found? Would be easier to help others when the error description would be ‚Äûhow change map not work!!‚Äú instead of ‚Äûserver not work‚Äú
00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Also it could make most configs one line shorter since any map from the own map pool is mostly something people would put in sv_map anyways
00:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh and also there is sv_map and change_map we could make it that sv_map actually can‚Äôt change the map so admins can savely exec autoexec.cfg without interrupting the game with a map change

00:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> working on something...
13:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> 64 player is definitely good for some gametypes but why even more? The UI elements already look cluttered with 64 players. It also doesn't work very well without a modified client. The dynamic id mapping used by ddnet in 0.6 is harder to implement in 0.7 since you cannot change the names anymore... And new stuff like whispering won't work for all players üòï
13:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> true, the id map is the biggest issue right now
13:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> to get correct information
13:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> otherwise its working already
13:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I am really hating 0.7 for that they made the snap less mod friendly and made everything with those net objects
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Not sure if there is already a problem with 128 players but with 256 players the snapshots would overflow (or rather stop working) if the skins and names were in the snap
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> true, 0.7 skins are larger
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in 0.6 256 worked
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Demos might stop working with a higher player count since they still use snap object for the name and skin
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oh, right
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> :/
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @redix why more than 64? Because the servers are full
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> And the map is still empty
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Yeah the 0.7 skins are pretty big. After compression it's not an issue anymore but when the snap is created they need the whole space
14:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The easier solution is spawning a second server üòÖ 
14:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I see the point but without breaking compatibility there will always be issues =\
14:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> true
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yea but imo it is nice to have a big map that can be explored all day long. And having as many tees in there as possible. With a max of 64 you have to choose between small boring map or being lonely most of the time.
15:02 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> you know, I have been thinking about this suggestion for fairness some more, and I want to ammend it
15:02 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> I think instead of raw kill streak adjustment, it should be average kill streak adjustment
15:03 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> ie, if you average 3 kills per life, you get 3 less hearts, but as that average decreases your hearts go back to normal, and if you get more kills per life enough to set your average below 1, you start getting more hearts
15:04 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> that means, everybody starts out at normal vanilla levels, and I think approximately every 2 kills lose a heart, down to a minimum 5/5 (or up to a max 15/15 or maybe 20/20, since the noobs that GET that far just won't live much longer because of it)
16:20 < day> i think the opposite should happen. you should spawn with less hp when you die
16:20 < day> respawn frags are a pest
16:21 < day> tees spawn way to strong
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Did anything about the map format change? Seems like the editor can only open maps in one way from 0.6 to 0.7 but not the other way around.
18:40 < Learath2> that was a quick merge
18:41 < Learath2> Oy: did you like the ui? I wasn't quite certain about the scrollbar
18:42 < Oy> Learath2: didn't check that out :P
18:42 < Oy> could be done later, when people complain
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @ChillerDragon there are definitely new elements. Some 0.7 maps might work in 0.6, others won't. At least bezier curves for envelopes are new... Not sure about other things
18:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> No... I guess no 0.7 map works in 0.6. The tile layers have a new compression mechanism
19:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 0.6 maps work in 0.7
19:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and that should not get broken
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yes it was very helpful that 0.6 maps work in 0.7
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Good to know thanks @redix üôÇ
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Do you have the commits by chance? Maybe we could add some forwards compatibility in the old clients
19:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Loading code is here: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/ffe839d8b61b42286f478058dffb8da4bf119024/src/engine/shared/map.cpp#L56-L85
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Thanks
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Saving: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/787035a27ac86affc26563f481cb772043b5db1f
19:52 < Learath2> Oy: What was the concern with the Values() thing btw?
20:00 < Oy> what values thing?
20:08 < Learath2> Moving the config variables into a struct
20:19 < Oy> making it non-global, so server and client can use it when build together
22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> how do i remove a password from my server <.<
22:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> here is no indicator:
22:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/blob/master/server_settings.md
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> password ""
22:29 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> day, the spawning thing is a good thought, I like the idea of it, but I think in practice that this will negate any benefit of it, because the problem is the advanced players outliving those without the years of built-up reflexes
22:30 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> also can anyone recommend a mapping tutorial
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune thx, now i just need sv_maprotation explained >.<
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Assa list of maps separated by spaces
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> well, that is too easy xD
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
