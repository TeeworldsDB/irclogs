16:18 < Sav> hi
16:22 <@matricks> hi
16:41 < CookieMichal> Did anyone use library called FMOD?
17:25 <@minus> i think soldat uses that
18:52 <@minus> interesting, i just started teeworlds and got this:
18:52 <@minus> [53fe0c97][textrender]: default pFont set 0x20a2380
18:52 <@minus> teeworlds: malloc.c:3697: _int_malloc: Assertion `victim->fd_nextsize->bk_nextsize == victim' failed.
19:35 < Dunedune> minus: were you not ingame?
19:51 < deen> minus: i get that about once every 100 times i start teeworlds
20:01 <@minus> deen: right on startup
20:02 < deen> yes
20:02 < deen> also, does anyone know how the TW masterservers are ddos protected now?
20:02 <@minus> i meant to highlight Dunedune
20:03 <@minus> they are. that's all there is to know
20:04 <@minus> in fact, one of them has an invoice due, so i will ask matricks to pay for it
20:04 <@matricks> :D
20:05 < deen> Hm, I'm getting DDoS attacks all the time on DDraceNetwork
20:05 < deen> (like right now)
20:05 <@minus> we didn't get any (or at least i didn't notice) for about a year
20:05 <@matricks> minus: for now much?
20:05 <@minus> $63
20:06 <@minus> that's the server + protection
20:06 <@matricks> just forward it to me
20:15 < PsychoGod> What is is time??? TEEWROROOOOLRRLDS TIMMMEEE!!!! YEAAAH!
20:15 < PsychoGod> :D
20:26 <@matricks> minus: erh, dunno how to pay this one without login :)
20:26 <@minus> hold on
20:26 <@matricks> minus: if you pay, I can send you money or something
20:27 <@minus> or i'll just give you my login
20:27 <@matricks> works as well
20:27 <@minus> do you not have your jabber server anymore?
20:28 <@matricks> nope :/ had no friends on jabber :/
20:28 <@minus> you had me :<
20:28 < PsychoGod> i'm with you <3
20:28 < PsychoGod> :D
20:28 <@matricks> :P
20:28 <@minus> pidgin says "Remote Server Not Found"
20:28 <@matricks> perhaps should set that up again ::::)
20:29 <@minus> 's very easy with prosody
20:29 <@matricks> yeah
20:29 <@matricks> thats what I used
20:29 <@matricks> all the others you have to read a 24098623 page book to setup
20:29 <@matricks> I'm sure that they can handle high bandwidth etc etc, but I just want it for me and a friend more or less :D
20:32 <@minus> matricks: sent you an email
20:32 <@matricks> got it
20:35 <@matricks> is this for a year or?
20:35 <@minus> yeah
20:35 <@matricks> done
20:35 <@minus> thanks â™¥
20:39 <@minus> aaand payment confirmed
20:39 <@matricks> o/
20:39 <@minus> that took quite a while
