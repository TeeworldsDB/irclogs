13:00 <@matricks> minus: y0, I heard about a nice way to get rid of spammers :D
13:01 <@matricks> minus: in a form, you add a hidden field that is empty, then you reject everything that has filled in that field

20:26 < dtw_> hi
20:28 < EastByte> hello
20:28 < dtw_> i have a little problem there... i added a new gamemode inherits gamecontroller, also registered it in gamecontext.cpp and when im trying to connect to it, it throws an error that my nethash from my client isnt similar to the nethash from my server. i know how to fix this bug dirty (changig it hardcoded in version.h) but i want to fix it in a better way.. any ideas?
20:35 < EastByte> nethash = CHash("src/game/generated/nethash.cpp", "src/engine/shared/protocol.h", "src/game/generated/protocol.h", "src/game/tuning.h", "src/game/gamecore.cpp", network_header)
20:35 < EastByte> be sure you don't change any of these files
20:35 < dtw_> im pretty sure
20:35 < dtw_> o_o
20:36 < Learath2> if you are working with git a diff should help ya
20:36 < dtw_> i just changed gamecontext.cpp and added 2 files :x
20:37 < Learath2> well that shouldnt change the nethash
20:39 < dtw_> yea thats dumb ._.
21:21 < dtw_> i found the error.. it was the source itself.. ._.
21:24 <@minus> why are polygons so hard ._.
21:24 <@minus> given a star-shaped polygon, find a point in its kernel in O(n)
21:24 < dtw_> wait.
21:24 < dtw_> problem found... im using vc12 to compile the source and my patch (replacing all round to round_to_int) also change gamecore.cpp
21:25 < dtw_> so i need another fix, because round make problems in vc12
21:26 < dtw_> can you tell me how? :s
21:55 < dtw_> fixed... i commented out the round function in math.h and im using git now.. thx to @Learath2
22:36 < Learath2> dtw_: why did you comment out round
22:37 < Learath2> doesnt sound like a very healthy fix
22:37 < dtw_> because it made a lot of compiling errors cause its already defined in a lib included by visual studio 12
22:38 < Learath2> dtw_: mind telling me which lib it is 
22:38 < dtw_> wait
22:38 < dtw_> VC\INCLUDE\math.h
22:41 < Learath2> huh i wonder why it includes math.h
22:42 < dtw_> i will comment it out until its fixed in another way :p
22:43 < dtw_> i will be back tomorrow, good night^^
22:56 <@matricks> minus: he polygon problem.. find a point, or find out if a point is inside it?
