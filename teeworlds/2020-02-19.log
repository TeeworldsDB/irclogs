00:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> when you're scraping a website you're also "just" navigating it like a user with a browser
00:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think that traffic is not much compared to players playing on a server.
00:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but you're also hitting them when people are not playing
00:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's a lot when done on an extended duration, I agree with heinrich on that
00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> imagine 50 people hosting your discord bot
00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> (and you hosting many servers on one actual machine)
00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the server expects 16 to 64 players playing 24/7
00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> expecting as much traffic.
00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I doubt anyone will use that bot.
00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe one or two people
00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> at most
00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> one would not host a game server if they don't expect at least some kind of player traffic.
00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's basically a max of 1500bytes, let's say 2KB every 16 seconds.
00:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 10.8 mb per day
00:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> one teeworlds game
00:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I get 33MB per server per month per instance running at 200bytes
00:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (rough size observed by opening teeworlds)
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> per instance running at 200bytes what do you mean by that?
00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> per instance of the bot running and assuming 200 bytes for the server answer because I just measured it with wireshark
00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ah, ok
00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, I calculated with the max packet size value
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 1,08 mb per server per day
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> based on 200bytes per request on average
00:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._. I'm dumb, just now understood that you actually meant the instance
00:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> of a bot
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> taking ddnet servers as a reference (ger), looking at their traffic, I see 100GB/month
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> at 16 servers, your bot roughly causes 500MB/month
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> i.e. 0.5% cost increase. that might be okay
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 1/200
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> playr
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (although ddnet servers are well populated, so cost increase will be larger for smaller servers)
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe implementing a callback would result in much less traffic
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> player
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> assuming most servers are empty
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> player
00:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, I wonder if anybody actually pays or their traffic.
00:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that hosts a gameserver Oo
00:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> traffic isn't free, some server hosters subsidize it
00:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (outbound)
00:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but 0.5% is okay, I think, unless more people start running your software
00:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if more people would use the bot via discord, it would lessen the actual load on server.
00:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> servers
00:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's a hypothesis ðŸ˜‰
00:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, on startup the browser refreshes anyway
00:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> providing a rest api for server querying :o, how's that
00:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> status.tw already has that tho
19:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> does teeworlds interpolate between updates on client side?
19:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *game frames
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yeah. linear prediction between the current and the last tick
19:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> interpolation*
