00:00 < Oy> well if you have fun it's no problem :)
00:04 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fp4HL
00:04 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 208000d oy: moved around the header bits to resemble the 0.6.5 header
00:05 < Oy> minus: when u have the time, can u update the master again? :)
00:07 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/ehWtFi6.png
00:07 <@Dune> not sure what do when _day or _night is missing
00:08 <@Dune> might want not to show the theme at all
00:08 < Oy> just take what's there for the whole day?
00:09 < Oy> an option "none" would be good - then we can remove the show background map option
00:09 <@Dune> already did that :D
00:09 <@Dune> the first line is none
00:09 <@Dune> just didn't figure what to display yet
00:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> Just saying, 4 byte token is still ridiculously less
00:10 < Oy> why?
00:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> Can be brute forced in reasonable time
00:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> Being a home connection and ~1 hour or a server connection and much less
00:11 <@heinrich5991> what size do you suggest?
00:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> 8 bytes is just on the edge of being brute force able, so I'd suggest that, because you don't need like 10 or so
00:12 <@heinrich5991> hmm. you think 8 bytes is still brute-forcable? I thought that'd be beyond that
00:12 < Oy> isn't there the ack number for client<>server conversation as well? have to guess that as well
00:13 <@heinrich5991> I get 16 million terabytes per byte of the packet you want to spoof
00:13 <@heinrich5991> yes, there is
00:13 < Oy> another 10 bits
00:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> 8 byte is just on the edge
00:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> Of what's possible
00:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> So reasonable for a game protocol
00:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> But I woidltn go lower than that
00:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> But I woidltn go lower than that
00:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> By the way, did I say you got like 3 or 4 different valid tokens? (old token, global token, etc), that like halves the time needed for brute force
00:15 <@heinrich5991> not for connections
00:15 <@heinrich5991> only for establishing the connection
00:15 < Oy> fixed the global tokens already
00:15 < Oy> tied them to broadcasts
00:16 < Oy> u can't abus them anymore
00:16 <@heinrich5991> hmm. you think sending 16 million terabytes is feasible?
00:17 < Oy> which teeworlds server can handle that?
00:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> No
00:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> I say sending 2gb is feasible
00:20 <@heinrich5991> yes. it's more around 2gb * bytes in the packet you want to spoof, which is around 50 or let's say 40
00:21 <@heinrich5991> but yea, that's probably possible
00:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> OK yeah sorry missed those
00:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> But packages are small
00:22 <@Dune> wait, you can't edit sorted_array ? :/
00:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> And you could probably optimize it a bit
00:24 <@heinrich5991> I'm off for today. good night :/
00:24 < Oy> gn8
00:24 < Oy> Dune ?
00:24 < Oy> edit how?
00:26 <@Dune> I have an array::range r for an array a and I expected that a[r] would work
00:26 <@Dune> I'll figure sth
00:27 < Oy> it's a range not a single index
00:28 <@Dune> right. gotta use front() then :)
00:28 < Oy> :P
00:28 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1706
00:28 <@Dune> aw, I love hotkeys
00:29 <@Dune> you can actually already do the settings page one with composed binds + ui_settings_page I believe
00:30 < Oy> it might interact with hotkey that open steam overlay in steam
00:30 <@Dune> oh, didn't think of that
00:30 < Oy> yeah should work with the bind
00:30 <@Dune> I tend to get issues with alt tab rather
00:30 < Oy> when the boundaries are set properly for the config
00:32 < Dune_linux> blob:https://imgur.com/cf23c19f-e326-4bc4-8dc3-9c56b9fca35c
00:32 < Dune_linux> https://i.imgur.com/uIAv9BO.png
00:33 < Oy> yeah, that's good
00:33 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/1C9HZ58.png
00:34 <@Dune> Sonix tried some icons (where the countryflags are)
00:34 <@Dune> two options
00:34 <@Dune> 1) we fetch a ***_icon.png for each ***_day/night.map and print it
00:34 <@Dune> 2) we use those two icons to signify day-only/night-only
00:34 <@Dune> 3) none of the above
00:35 < Oy> 1?
00:35 <@Dune> sounds good
00:35 <@Dune> need to store the PNG somewhere
00:36 < Oy> datasrc/ui/
00:37 <@Dune> oh, I meant in the code. gotta preload it
00:37 <@Dune> I made a themes/ folder rather
00:37 <@Dune> that might be better to group all that
00:37 <@Dune> ui/themes
00:37 < Oy> yeah, thats good
00:37 < Oy> with the maps
00:37 <@Dune> yes
00:37 < Oy> background pones
00:38 <@Dune> sonix doing such a good job with maps
00:38 < Oy> yeah :)
00:39 < Oy> what did u mean with preload? just handle it like it's done with the icons in the server browser
00:40 <@Dune> well they are sort of preloaded
00:41 <@Dune> but yeah I'll just use the same structs
00:44 <@Dune> the things you can get away with gcc, it's amazing
00:44 <@Dune> I defined my class twice and forgot about it
00:44 <@Dune> in :: and CMenus:: scope
00:44 <@Dune> gcc didn't even give a warning
00:45 <@Dune> both accessible

19:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> did something happen to the textures?

20:06 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master a6e8bb7 oy: use linear mapping just for icons
20:06 < Oy> ^ Sonix-: that should fix it
20:09 < Oy> Sonix-: the map looks great and relaxing :)
20:10 < Sonix-> thanks :D
20:23 <@Dune> Oy: probably should close https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1449 then
20:23 <@Dune> Sonix-: exactly what Oy said. feels relaxing, that's what I want for a background :)
20:24 <@Dune> btw, with respect to the ingame menus issue
20:24 <@Dune> I had added a black background to tie up the menus together: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/355114/48788383-029b4500-eceb-11e8-8d4f-f19bdbf07ead.png
20:25 <@Dune> but maybe that should be done alongside with the alpha fix, directly modifying the settings menu?
20:30 < bridge_> [freenode] <kpro998> heinrich5991 did u get my message in discord?
20:31 < Sonix-> what about something looking this way? Dune https://daks2k3a4ib2z.cloudfront.net/55e67eeba2e73cb76514f165/59566d90ed965e4d0f429de2_Doc%20Tabs%20Fig%2001.png
20:31 < Sonix-> tabbed menus
20:31 <@Dune> @kpro998 heinrich hasn't been on discord in a while afaik, he's quite busy
20:31 <@Dune> Sonix-: ooh, that's really good
20:32 <@Dune> you should post that in the issue :)
20:32 < bridge_> [freenode] <kpro998> ah okay
20:38 <@Dune> Oy:
20:39 <@Dune> this guy wants to report a security issue privately
20:39 <@Dune> it doesn't seem necessary to me but well
20:40 <@Dune> maybe minus could handle that?
20:40 < Oy> Dune: closed it
20:40 <@Dune> thx
20:41 <@Dune> I'm not knowledgeable enough about masterservers to sort it out
20:41 < Oy> what's the security issue? teeworlds code related?
20:41 <@Dune> mastersrv
20:41 < Oy> the 0.7 ones?
20:41 <@Dune> 0.6
20:41 <@Dune> that's why idk if it's still an issue ornot
20:42 < Oy> well they're probably fubar anyway
20:42 <@Dune> yeah
20:42 < Oy> but could try to fix it
20:42 <@Dune> kpro998: you think it's in 0.7 too?
20:44 <@Dune> minus: ping
20:46 < Oy> Dune: about the background, then zou would have to add it in general, the offline menus dont have it either
20:46 <@Dune> yeah but saw sonix's suggestion?
20:46 <@Dune> https://daks2k3a4ib2z.cloudfront.net/55e67eeba2e73cb76514f165/59566d90ed965e4d0f429de2_Doc%20Tabs%20Fig%2001.png
20:48 <@Dune> updated the theme PR moving @Sonix's files in the folder btw
20:51 < Oy> hm, yeah but then you have to change the complete design to have it consistent
20:52 <@Dune> :/ aight
20:53 <@Dune> I think the background should be in offline menus too tbh
20:53 < Oy> hm, the other ingame menus look different anyway
20:53 <@Dune> ah, forgot about them
20:57 < Oy> about the ingame menus: if the bottom button line is there in general, the game tab could be removed and server info should probably be the first one
20:58 <@Dune> huh
20:59 <@Dune> the only problem would be the reset button
20:59 <@Dune> of the menus
21:01 < Oy> could move the disconnect button to the right, next to record game
21:01 < Oy> *left
21:04 <@Dune> :/
21:07 <@Dune> https://puu.sh/C6556/5c15e1aa1e.jpg
21:07 <@Dune> the clickable tabs are wayy too transparent imo
21:07 <@Dune> doesn't look like something clickable at all
21:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> would love to click on "Settings" again to close the tab
21:11 <@Dune> @LordSk: and exit ingame menus completely?
21:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I guess clicking on the greyed out tabs also works
21:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> but feel weird?
21:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> like I shouldnt be clicking on them
21:12 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/components/menus.cpp#L1095 could add 0.05
21:12 <@Dune> and the tabs don't get greyed when you click anything else
21:12 < Oy> well, when you move the mouse over them you see that u can interact with them
21:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Dune: and only exit the setting tab
21:14 < Oy> lordsk but then where do u go? which tab should be active then?
21:14 <@Dune> you can figure it, yes
21:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> none like at the start?
21:15 <@Dune> they feel almost invisible right now :/ not intuitive enough imo
21:15 < Oy> there is always one active
21:15 <@Dune> @LordSk start has game active, right
21:15 < Oy> yeah
21:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> oh alright then
21:15 <@Dune> well, not anymore since the settings are saved
21:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah ok
21:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it's confusing
21:16 <@Dune> ye :|
21:16 < Oy> yeah it is :)
21:16 < Oy> best is to remove as many submenus etc.  as possible :)
21:16 <@Dune> since we added a row of tabs below Settings, I feel like it wouldn't be so inconsistent to add one below Game
21:18 < Oy> yeah good idea
21:18 < Oy> hm, but then it gets harder to go from a submenu in settings to another in game
21:18 <@Dune> hm, ho wso?
21:19 <@Dune> at the contrary?
21:19 <@Dune> ah you mean, from a settings submenu to another settings submenu?
21:20 < Oy> when in settings: you have to go to game and then change to the submenu "player"
21:20 <@Dune> huh
21:20 <@Dune> ah, that wasn't what I meant
21:21 <@Dune> I meant moving spectate/joined red/etc as a second raw of buttons under game
21:21 <@Dune> when you're looking for something the mouse should only be flying on the top of the screen imo. only when you want something specific in the settings/callvote you move down
21:21 <@Dune> imo
21:21 < Oy> ah
21:22 <@Dune> right now, if you left the menus anywhere but in "Game", you have to do:
21:22 <@Dune> 1) click "Game" on the top left  2) click Disconnect on the bottom right
21:22 <@Dune> to disconnect for example :c
21:23 < Oy> would rather have to show the bottom button line all the time instead of moving them up
21:23 <@Dune> that's fair too
21:23 < Oy> cause all buttons to interact with the menus are on the bottom right now
21:23 < Oy> reset back, connect etc
21:24 <@Dune> the "Back" button should be removed
21:24 < Oy> ingame yeah
21:24 <@Dune> yeah
21:24 < Oy> feels obsolete now
21:24 <@Dune> the Reset button needs to be moved if we make Disconnect permanent either way
21:25 <@Dune> but that's why I replied in https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1698 that the issue with menus savestate is only obsolete if the join red/blue/disconnect buttons are moved
21:25 <@Dune> because of the "click both corners" UX
21:25 <@Dune> not sure what you can do with Reset/Disconnect :/
21:27 <@Dune> you think moving Disconnect left is a good idea?
21:28 < Oy> maybe not :)
21:28 <@Dune> hmm
21:28 < Oy> might be better to put the reset button somewhere else
21:28 <@Dune> yeah I agree
21:30 < Oy> it could be moved between record game and disconnect ingame - might be a bit odd that it has a different position ingame than offline but yeah
21:33 < Oy> or do a second button row on the bottom, with just the reset button (above the disconnect button)
21:43 < minus> Dune: pong
22:04 < bridge_> [freenode] <kpro998> minus are you there I would like to talk to you about a masterserver issue
22:05 < minus> yes hello
22:05 < minus> i'm kinda busy though, i'm resilvering a 12TB disk
22:06 < bridge_> [freenode] <kpro998> alright, just wondering if theres somewhere I can talk to you about this issue privately because I know there are people who would abuse this issue even more if I said it here
22:06 <@Dune> can't you come to quakenet kpro998?
22:07 < bridge_> [freenode] <kpro998> one sec, it wasn't working for me earlier
22:08 < minus> better talk to Dune, heinrich5991 or oy, i guess
22:26 <@Dune> minus: it's about masterserver config, Oy told him to talk to you
22:26 < minus> yeah no, not quite
23:37 <@Dune> not quite?
