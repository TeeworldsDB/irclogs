00:14 < Obani> matricks, I know
00:17 < Obani> Does someone know how to use mods for servers ?
19:56 < Obani> Is oy on that channel ?
19:56 <@matricks> yes
19:56 <@matricks> sometimes
19:56 < Obani> That would just be to tell him to put a commit link when he closes and issue, it would be nicer for issue-readers :)
20:07 <@minus> matricks: is bam 0.4.0 the latest?
20:13 < Obani> matricks, do you know where can I find svg files for teeworlds graphics ?
20:13 < Obani> ( I guess it's .svg)
20:15 < v0idpwn> Hallo :3
20:16 < Obani> yo v0idpwn :)
20:16 < v0idpwn> I dont think there's one, Obani.
20:17 < v0idpwn> *sry I just read again*.. 
20:18 < v0idpwn> I dont think there are svg files for teeworlds.
20:18 < Obani> v0idpwn, why ? It really seems like inkscape work
20:18 < Obani> It would be stupid to delete the svg file, as it's the easiest way to work on a texture for enhancers
20:20 < Obani> Is it hard to create steam achievements for a game ?
20:20 < Obani> It would be a funny thing to add some to the 0.7 Steam update ^^
20:20 < Obani> (I recently downloaded the Steam version)
20:21 < v0idpwn> I've searched some time ago, and seems like svg files never were released, I dont know why.
20:21 < Obani> :/
20:21 < Obani> *The ghost artist stikes again*
20:22 < Obani> That would just be to try doing that https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1414
20:22 < v0idpwn> Making achievements is not hardm I think
20:22 < v0idpwn> w8, my mouse died and i'm on text interface
20:23 < v0idpwn> Oh, I was looking into this some time ago.
20:24 < v0idpwn> I never worked with graphics, but this is basic texturing, you may do it without much effort, dont? (srsly sry if i'm wrong)
20:24 < v0idpwn> I think the hardest part is implementing this into the game
20:24 < v0idpwn> xd
20:25 < Obani> v0idpwn, no it's not basic graphic
20:25 < Obani> Try to look by zooming
20:25 < Obani> There are many little details
20:25 <@minus> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything ‚Üê updated
20:26 < v0idpwn> oh
20:28 < v0idpwn> I'm back with my project of automatic language selection. I was getting some problems irl but I'm ready to continue it. Havent done much anyway, heh.
20:28 < Obani> minus, could you precise that fetch is equal to wget and others ?
20:30 <@minus> Obani: F5
20:30 < Obani> And also minus, could you add the github version at the end with something like this ? : " If you want to download the developemment version, replace the "teeworlds-VERSION-src.zip" with this link : https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-maps/archive/master.zip "
20:31 <@minus> no
20:31 < Obani> minus, you forgot indentation :)
20:31 <@minus> fixed already
20:32 < Obani> also thanks, I didn't know F5 was refreshing page ^^
20:34 <@minus> are you serious?
20:34 < Obani> yes

20:34 < Obani> now
20:34 < Obani> it's Alt+F4 
20:35 < Obani> and Ctrl+C Ctrl+V :)
20:35 < v0idpwn> .-.

20:36 < Obani> oy is superactive 0.o
20:36 < Obani> Also, would you like to add musics in-game ?
20:40 < v0idpwn> minus: what is the 0.7 launch prediction?
20:45 <@minus> i've heard something about this year
