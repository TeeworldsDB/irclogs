12:01 < claymore_> I've been on 0.6.3 since forever, had no idea there was another release... any idea how severe the remote code execution vulnerability was, or if there was evidence of it being exploited?
12:04 < EastByte> remote code execution? From where did you get that?
12:05 < claymore_> from what 0.6.4 is supposed to fix
12:06 < EastByte> ah, you are talking about the client
12:06 < claymore_> yup
12:12 < EastByte> well, I atleast don't know any evidence of it being exploited
12:13 < claymore_> oh well, that's something
