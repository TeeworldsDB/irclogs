00:24 < day> why does a 'grep -r "m_aWeapons" not reveal anything about this presumable struct? I only find it in server/entities/character.cpp and there it is only being used but not initiated o0
00:46 < day> Dune: you there? *not gonna pesker you with coding questions* :p
00:46 <@Dune> ig
00:47 < day> just some teeworlds idea i have in mind
00:47 < day> i think one of the issues teeworlds has is that everyone can just use a random nick, you cant do ladder boards, build a community or do anything that requires fixed user accounts
00:49 <@Dune> i havent seen this being much of a problem
00:49 < day> well because noone is playing which in itself is a problem :P
00:49 <@Dune> I don't think that's it. people recognize each other just fine
00:49 < day> theres at best one public ctf server running
00:50 < day> im trying to come up with ideas to get the user count up
00:50 <@Dune> implement them :P
00:50 < day> because the status quo is just sad lol
00:50 <@Dune> then be a content creator
00:51 < day> most successful multiplayer games have some kind of reward loop
00:51 < day> ladder boards or similar
00:51 <@Dune> then program one
00:52 < day> i was merely curious what your thought on this was
00:52 <@Dune> everyone says what they think should be done and no one does anything ^^
00:53 < day> :D
00:53 < day> i didn mean to tell you what to do
00:59 <@Dune> right now we need someone to produce gfx, that's the biggest problem
00:59 < day> what kind of gfx?
00:59 <@Dune> huh, well ingame stuff?
01:00 <@Dune> icons and what not
01:00 < day> map tiles, tee styles ? something specific?
01:00 < day> or just 'everything'?
01:00 <@Dune> just have an artist
01:00 < day> i dont feel like the art stuff is limiting the game :/
01:01 <@Dune> it's limiting the development at least
01:01 <@Dune> the 0.7.3 milestone needs a few gfx issues fixed
01:01 < day> ah i see. i thought you were simply aiming for 'more variety'
01:35 < day> is there a scenario where a weapon aside from WEAPON_GUN reloads?
01:36 < day> e.g. is there a server setting that allows you to have reload on other guns?
11:44 <@Dune> not on pure teeworlds, day 
11:45 <@Dune> to your earlier question, grep -r m_aWeapons gives this:
11:46 <@Dune>  } m_aWeapons[NUM_WEAPONS];
11:46 <@Dune> so it's a struct defined on the fly
11:46 <@Dune> src/game/server/entities/character.h-           int m_Ammo;
11:46 <@Dune> src/game/server/entities/character.h-           bool m_Got;
11:46 <@Dune> src/game/server/entities/character.h-
11:46 <@Dune> src/game/server/entities/character.h:   } m_aWeapons[NUM_WEAPONS];
