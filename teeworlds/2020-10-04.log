20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> How to see if my post just rejected on some error or awaiting for premoderation?
20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> There was no message when I've posted.
20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> I mean in a forum
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there's a bit of a delay when posting things on the forum atm
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we could remove the post approval constraint for old users
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> don't think there is any way to check
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Thanks, I am not an old user though. At least I have never registered at forum before the last week.
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Woah. I see my post there, thanks for clarifications
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> Sorry for asking it here. But does forum support youtube embedding?
21:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> no
21:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> punbb doesn't do much
