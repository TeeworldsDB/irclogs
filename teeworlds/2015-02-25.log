14:40 < Kaliiixx> Hi !
14:40 <@matricks> HERRO!
14:42 < Kaliiixx> When teeworlds says that I should be registred to play, is this a common registration or a specific registration to each server ?
14:43 < heinrich5991> Kaliiixx: probably a server-specific registration
14:43 < heinrich5991> which game type are you playing on?
14:43 <@matricks> Kaliiixx: there is no player registration in teeworlds, you are playing a mod
14:43 < Kaliiixx> Xpanic for instance
14:43 < heinrich5991> yea, server-specific
14:43 < heinrich5991> has nothing to do with teeworlds globally
14:43 < Kaliiixx> Ok, thank you ^^
14:44 < Kaliiixx> Does a mean exist to filter this servers from the list ?
14:45 < Kaliiixx> these*
14:45 < heinrich5991> no, unfortunately not
14:45 < Kaliiixx> Okay
14:45 < heinrich5991> if you're only playing known game types you'll probably not encounter htis
14:45 < Kaliiixx> Thanks :)
14:45 <@matricks> you shouldn't encounter it
14:45 < heinrich5991> like DM, TDM, CTF, Race, DDRace
14:45 <@matricks> if you do, that server should be banned
14:46 < Kaliiixx> Well
14:46 < Kaliiixx> Thanks a lot !
14:47 < heinrich5991> you're welcome
14:50 <@matricks> mmmm.. fez <3
15:32 < jxsl13> zcatch!
