01:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 people actually do not seem to care about the ranks
04:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <1stDecadeTW> Ranking system like yours ChilleeDragon should be implemented as default in official vanilla gametypes.
04:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <1stDecadeTW> Ranking system like yours ChillerDragon should be implemented as default in official vanilla gametypes.
11:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> early stage, you gotta push activity by playing yourself more often
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, actually a token expires after 90 seconds it seems
17:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> one does not simply ad centralized db
17:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> What is the vote option limit in teeworlds 0.7?
17:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ehm
17:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> isn't is a linked list
17:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> check the enum entry
17:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ?
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> Reached the maximum numbers of votes ._.
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <MrCosmo> Should be 128
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> Okey thanks!
17:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> you can simply increase it
17:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> is that serverside?
17:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what about client side?
17:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes it is
17:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> but doesn't the client also restrict it?
17:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no
17:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> not afaik
17:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> well is that a change of 1 line?
17:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> I'm not a coder myself but only a "hoster" could you tell me where those line is and which line
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *excited response writing*
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> can simply increase `MAX_VOTE_OPTIONS` in src/game/voting.h#L13
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> switch to zilly hosting
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> best hoster for free tw server
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> annoying
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ˜„
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Now you spammed this channel and xen cant read my message anymore
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ;o I see the sarcasm
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> u
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> o.O
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @ShootXen got it?

17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oh you adapted to my secret? :p
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sure
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i always do that
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> yea
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye i finally am used to it
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> still dont know how to add friends in discord tho xd
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> click on the profile pic
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> then again
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and then on the 3 dots
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> by name
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oh
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> you need the Name#Number
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and then go to top left (discord home or somethging like that), then click Friends tab and just enter it there
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> do I need to scale it up? or does any number the job
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @ShootXen any number, ddnet uses 8196
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i swear on windows my discord did not have the green ad friend button
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or something else
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/blob/master/src/game/voting.h#L13
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> should be less than ur ram size ideally i guess xd
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> shouldnt matter
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah, should not matter, you can use swap
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> and you should not exceed the net buffer ðŸ˜®
17:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> you mean increase?
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does the whole teeworlds protocol use that handshake/token pattern that's being used with the masterserver?
18:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> correct any  unprecise terminology ._.
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> for the serverbrowser info it's the same i think. for connected clients the token management is a bit different
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> at least as far as i remember ðŸ˜„
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok
18:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thanks for the info
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 the management is different, the semantics are the same
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you request a token, you can use that to send connless packets or create connections
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I was wondering if I could use the same header wrapper abstraction
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how does random work in automappers?
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/669984176463937586/unknown.png
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> like what does this random 150 mean?
20:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> 1/150 chance
20:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> of triggering the rule
20:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah ty
20:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's about the only part that's missing in the tutorial in fact
20:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well i have to admit that is kinda intuitive
20:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @LordSk tends to write intuitive stuff :)
20:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> actually I think the format was changed by oy
20:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> imo its way harder to find the tutorial then understanding from just looking at it ðŸ˜„
20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> 2n2 ctf tournament ongoing
20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> come cheer for team croiÃ§ant
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *upvotes LordSK for being awesome*
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> when will the editor be released or is there more awesome stuff in regard to animations happening ._.?
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon we start
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> k am i playing or rand() ?
20:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> why not both!
21:04 < rand> I m so great
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ok but startid and endid confuses me
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i guess rx and ry is rotation
21:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes
21:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and what is startid and endid?
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> location ah i see
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its setting multiple tiles at once?
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> no?
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> don't think so at least
21:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/670000172587155466/unknown.png
21:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> looks like imo
21:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> grass doodads
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=help
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> shouldnt the docs for that be here?
21:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah yes that's doodads rules
21:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> plenty of things "should" be done, and won't be as long as no one does it
21:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so where are the docs
21:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't think anyone has written docs to be ported there
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I wrote part of a tutorial there last year: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12648
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also no docs on startid or rotation there
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im just play around
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if no one writes docs, there are no docs :p
21:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm rotation didnt work
21:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @redix what do you think about p2p friends system, where you add the IP like servers?
21:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yikes
21:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ip leaks
21:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well voluntary ip leaks
21:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon play?
21:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so only if both agree @Dune ?
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes, you have to send friend requests
21:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you send a request to the server, which sends your IP to the target
21:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> then you can periodically ping people and have a friend list, without a (problematic) central server. You can have online notifications, PMs, etc.
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It's probably a bad idea if the ddnet guys didn't do it though :) @heinrich5991?
21:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm, I don't think we really considered that
21:46 < Learath2> Can you think of a relatively simple way to implement a set data structure in the template library?
21:47 < Learath2> I'd like to avoid having to code a red black tree and implementing set with that if possible, besides I doubt you'd accept such a bloated pr :P
21:47 < Dune> wait, which template library?
21:48 < Learath2> teeworlds template library, what we have in base/tl
21:48 < Dune> ah
21:48 < Dune> good question
21:48 < Dune> does it have to be efficient?
21:48 < Learath2> Not for my usecase, but if we are adding it there, might be a good idea to make it efficient, no?
21:49 < Learath2> Maybe could implement it in terms of a sorted_array, insertion would be amortized O(logn) in that case
21:53 < Dune> I think a sorted_array would be fine depending on the use
21:55 < Dune> AVL trees are o(log n) too for insertion right
21:56 < Dune> so comparable writes but slower reads
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> am i brainded or is the coordinate system wrong in the docs Dune?
21:59 < Dune> possibly
21:59 < Dune> I wrote the tutorial very quickly
21:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i would rather say wrong in the code
21:59 < Dune> that's less likely
21:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> because i like the way it is in the docs ðŸ˜„
21:59 < Dune> how is it wrong?
22:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/670010132314456074/unknown.png

22:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the y
22:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> og
22:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> omg wait
22:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no
22:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im confused xd
22:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nvm then
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i swear i just was the other way around xd
22:09 < Dune> Learath2, tbh o(n) reads o(log n) writes should be fine for teeworlds use cases...
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but complaining about the stl
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I find that inconsistent
22:11 < Dune> I think the stl containers are bad for the standards an stl should have
22:11 < Dune> they're completely fine for teeworlds
22:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> okay
22:11 < Dune> efficiency-wise at least
22:13 < Learath2> Reads would be O(logn) aswell
22:13 < Dune> ah, yes
22:15 < Dune> iirc the motive behind most teeworlds tl rewrites is safety? bounds checking for strings, ...
22:16 < Dune> @heinrich5991 makes a good point, if there is no performance or safety gain, std::set would be fine?
22:16 < Learath2> hmm, im not sure when tw wrote it's tl, stl had allocator support
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 0.6 also had a weird coordinates system
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nah all fine
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i confused something
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i have the feeling my automapper looks at the indicies and not if full or empty
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> because the order of automapper types i apply make a difference
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i mean how is it possible that a automapper chooses differently for the same shape?
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/670028159407751198/unknown.png
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> huh, what?
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it will apply rules from top to bottom
23:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it looks at indicies
23:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> or better rotation
23:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> or im lost
23:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't understand what you say
23:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ok lemme send 100 screens xd
23:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no automapper:

23:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well yes, it applies rules in order, and does not apply it to already automapped tiles
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh eh by rule i mean like
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the thing
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/670029668237180947/unknown.png
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> "double vertical" = rule1
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> "double horizontal" = rule2
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how are those bubbles named?
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rules?
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rule types?
23:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i expected same shapes to have same results after automap? Or i really missunderstood the mapper.
