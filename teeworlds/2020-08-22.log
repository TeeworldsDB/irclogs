17:48 <@heinrich5991> minus: ddnet wants to stop hosting master4
17:58 < deen> the reason is that it causes DoS attacks that can affect the other things running on the same server, and we don't have a spare server around
18:08 < minus> i can remove it
20:41 < minus> say the word and i'll remove the DNS record
20:50 <@heinrich5991> the master server isn't online anymore and the server had its IP address changed
20:50 <@heinrich5991> you can remove the DNS record
