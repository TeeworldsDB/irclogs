23:01 <@minus> heinrich5991: those posts you replied to today look suspiciously like spam D: going by user names
23:02 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:02 <@heinrich5991> but then the questions sounded real
23:02 <@minus> i'd assume they're prepping some accounts with posts to modify lateron with spam links
23:02 <@heinrich5991> if they haven't been posted before, I'd definitely err on the side of "not spam"
23:02 <@minus> i'm a bit surprised registering in the forums is still possible
23:14 < pinkieval> minus: recaptcha only shows the api error to a portion of the users
23:15 < pinkieval> to give admins time to upgrade to the v2 api, before v1 is definitely closed
23:18 <@minus> hm
23:18 <@minus> i'd just disable it then
23:18 <@minus> don't wanna train drones for killing people
23:21 < pinkieval> you can still pass the captcha v2 when making "clever" mistakes on purpose
23:22 < pinkieval> like selecting stuff that looks like what it's asking for, but isn't
