01:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is it possible to make a complete mod with econ? so that it is allowed to use a Vanilla gametype? :p
01:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon
10:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> The vanilla functionalities are limited, you can only do vanilla server actions
10:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> RPG-like stuff maybe
10:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but the broadcast/say commands are global
12:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea as dune said econ can only do what a regular client with admin can do.
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> any opinions on using a higher res image for the console bar? The background already is higher res https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/datasrc/ui/console.png we could keep or even reduce file size by reducing the useless repititions https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/datasrc/ui/console_bar.png

18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Hm the console bar looks even worse in my screenshot is my fullhd screen the limit? Somehow the other stuff looks sharper.
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh and i can set sv_max_clients to 64 but the actual limit stays 16? xd
18:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what limit, where,
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i could not join the server
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i knew the player_slots limit has a max of 16 but i thought i coudl join as spec
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it just said server is full
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `the actual limit stays 16` where do you see 16?
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> in the browser it says 16/16
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and if i try to join it says its full
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but ``sv_max_clients`` prints 64
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> 16/16 without "count players only"?
18:58 < ***> Buffer Playback...
18:58 < bridge> [18:41:39] [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah probably you are right @Dune  thanks. I started a new server and now it also shows in server browser i must have changed that via rcon and in config a few days back and forgotton about it.
18:58 < bridge> [18:41:48] [teeworlds] <Dune> :)
18:58 < bridge> [18:41:51] [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But it should actually be possible to connect 64 clients on a vanilla server right?
18:58 < bridge> [18:41:58] [teeworlds] <Dune> yes
18:58 < bridge> [18:42:07] [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cool
18:58 < bridge> [18:42:26] [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> then i can finally afk as spec without blocking slots ðŸ™‚
18:58 < ***> Playback Complete.
