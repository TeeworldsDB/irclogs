02:05 < uchar> hi
02:06 < uchar> why teeworlds wait 300ms before play the next sound?
08:26 < heinrich5991> uchar: you could use git blame to find out
08:32 <@matricks> uchar: huh?
08:33 < heinrich5991> it might be the thing that prevents stacking sounds, like when a custom server sends 10 chat messages at once
08:36  * matricks pokes heinrich5991 
08:37 <@matricks> heinrich5991: what are you doing with rust and teeworlds?
08:37 < heinrich5991> I'm writing a library to read teeworlds maps
08:38 <@matricks> k
09:17 <@minus> heinrich5991: any further goal to that?
09:17 < heinrich5991> minus: the motivation was to have a tool that can classify maps
09:18 < heinrich5991> because the map archive has grown so big that a manual classification is out of question :)
09:18 <@minus> ;D
09:18 <@minus> is that gonna be heuristic or is it possible precisely
09:18 <@matricks> just classify all as crap and you are done :D
09:19 <@minus> shotsfired
09:19 <@matricks> CRITICAL HIT!
09:20 <@matricks> but seriously, usually like 99% of user created content is.. well.. subpar :)
09:22 <@minus> proper balancing does require a liiittle bit of effort after all. w ell, unless the map is completely symmetric
09:22 <@minus> table soccer time
09:22 < heinrich5991> ddrace maps aren't that bad usually, because there are curators
09:22 < heinrich5991> vanilla needs to be more open to mapping to allow that I guess
09:23 <@matricks> open to mapping?
09:25 < heinrich5991> yes
09:26 < heinrich5991> e.g. no standard map filter active by default
09:26 <@matricks> oh
10:45 < Sadale> heinrich5991, I think it already exists.
10:45 < heinrich5991> what already exists?
10:45 < Sadale> heinrich5991, in case you didn't know, https://sushitee.github.io/tml/
10:45 < Sadale> <heinrich5991> I'm writing a library to read teeworlds maps
10:46 < heinrich5991> yea, but that can only read vanilla and race maps
10:46 < Sadale> ah!
14:37 < uchar> Thx heinrich5991, i see it on the source but i dont know the theory for delay sounds :B
20:17 < heinrich5991> does someone know a screenshot program that can also screensho(o?)t the flashplayer?
20:17 < heinrich5991> it shows green for me where the flash player is supposed to be. interestingly, capturing vlc works fine.
20:17 < Savander> sharex?
20:21 < heinrich5991> Savander: seems to be windows-only
20:21 < Savander> :/
20:31 < LittleWhite> Is there on Linux, you got this problem ?
20:32 < LittleWhite> I got exactly the same problem with mplayer, and the only solution is to add a flag when starting mplayer
20:32 < LittleWhite> of course, you can't with Flash, but I guess this is because of funky things going on GPU
20:33 < LittleWhite> so, in fact, I don't have a solution for this case ... apart of saying (as always) that flash sucks a lot
20:47 <@minus> heinrich5991: you have problems… just uninstall flash
20:48 <@minus> heinrich5991: you could try disabling GPU acceleration in the flash settings (right click → settings)
20:51 < LittleWhite> The first minus' solution is of course, the best one :D
23:23 < Savander> we need 3 players to record a demo
23:23 < Savander> to trailer
23:23 < Savander> 3 more players *
23:23 < Savander> me, teetow and someone you
23:23 < Savander> could you help us? :D
23:24 <@matricks> huh?
23:24 < Savander> just need 5 players
23:24 < Savander> to "fight"
23:24 < Savander> max 10 minutes ^^>
23:32 < LittleWhite> Which server ?
23:32 < LittleWhite> I am too late, maybe :D
23:34 < LittleWhite> I think, i was too much ;)
23:38  * teetow is making trailer wubs
23:38 <@matricks> omg
23:39 < Savander> LittleWhite,  you're not
23:39 < Savander> you are on demo
23:39 < Savander> :D
23:39 < LittleWhite> It was a bad day :p
23:40 < LittleWhite> I think, it was really confusing (too many player). I hope you will get something from it
23:43 < Savander> yes
23:43 < Savander> i thought, there will be max 5 players ^^
23:43 < Savander> but, it's good for movie :PP
23:44 < LittleWhite> Good :)
