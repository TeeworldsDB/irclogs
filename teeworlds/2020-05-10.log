01:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I decided to remove 128 players now again from my server. The reason why is because it is just too laggy to always send those connect/disconnect packets :/ otherwise it was working very well, also with the players with same IP having the same IDs (for dummy hammerfly and correct pings in chat). Whispers were also working. There was nothing bad about excpet the laggs coming from the (i guess) connect/disconnect packets. When I did 
01:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune could we move the playerinfo back to snaps for 0.8?
01:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> move it to another branch
01:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> The player info is fat because of skin names, @fokkonaut
01:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> people might wanna use it as reference
01:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @jxsl13 why would they, it doesnt matter anyways
01:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> It is just too laggy
01:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as reference that can be improved with threads
01:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I asked @Learath2, it seems this cant be threaded in an easy way+
01:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its a function that gets called every tick
01:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or basically every 5th, in ddnet
01:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> for me every 50th, due to the packets :/
01:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Also, @jxsl13 what would a thread do better? The packets still need to go out
01:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Its not just the algorithm, that should still be fine for 128 players
01:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune is the playerinfo *soo* much bigger that we cant handle it anymore?
01:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Well, it would take a significant amount of bandwidth
01:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> snaps are deltashots so they only send new stuff, dont they?
01:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> At least that was the reasoning behind this change as far as I know (and according to @heinrich5991 )
01:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm not sayi g I have a solution, but saying to leave your hours of work for someone that might have one. dumping that rather big project into tue trash bin is just a waste.
01:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the first three or so aren't deltashots
01:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I would love to give those 20-30 extra players per day the chance to play, but with these laggs it is just not possible
01:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Also its a damn nice feeling if you know your server got 94 players at once, for 0.7 and 0.6
01:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well it's not like they can't play. two 64p servers sounds reasonable to me
01:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But the map is so big that it is just awesome to have that many players at one server, not spread apart
01:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I understand, it sounds like there is a difficult compromise and I don't have the technical knowledge of the Teeworlds network stuff to weight benefits and inconvenients
01:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm
01:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't know how exactly the player messages work
01:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you say it's join/leave
01:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that should cause less traffic than changing snapshots
01:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> definitely not, it sends a whole packet of the tee: name, clan, skinparts, country
01:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> also the cid of course, whether its local
01:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that would also be in the snapshot, at least if we'd do it as you propose
01:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> and it would cause more traffic than the join/leave packets
01:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> why?
01:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> because when you move that information into the snapshot (like it was before), then it would have to be sent multiple times if the client has a ping >40ms
01:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the server sends the difference to the last acked snapshot
01:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so if the client can't ack within 40ms (time difference between two snaps), then you're going to send the player changes twice
01:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so is there a good solution to this?
01:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you say that the players are far away from each other?
01:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> perhaps you could send less player changes
01:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i already send them each 50 ticks
01:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ddnet does it each 5th tick
01:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> well, maybe one could get away with not sending them at all unless one needs a change
01:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> i.e. only send them if a player comes into view that the client doesn't currently have
01:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> mh
08:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The algorithm already tries to keep the player list stable, your really shouldnt be getting this many connect disconnects tbh
08:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 it is possible that the handling for the snaps is more efficient then handling the packets, even chunks bunched together will have to go through some unpacking of the headers
08:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Vital packets mean that there will be resends
11:06 < ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut why don't you give it a try to clear the weapon drops up a bit. The whole map is flooded with weapons that collide and can be collected etc sounds to me like a half tee. Imo its worth a try to decrease the amount.
13:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> How many packets per second does the server send, how high is the cpu load? Are the clients experiencing packet loss or even disconnects?
13:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The resend mechanism in tw is really simple. It might just not be sufficient for sending packets periodically.
13:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> When a resend is necessary the server needs to resend all packets. This amount of data might lead to packet loss again, so the queue builds up...
13:33 < ChillerDragon> cpu load is at 80% avg redix 
13:33 < ChillerDragon> no disconnects
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Problem with the size of the player data is not only that the server needs additional bandwidth.
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The size of the snapshots is limited (64k as far as I remember). With 64 players the player data requires about 15k in the snap. There is still enough space but it's just waisting a huge amount of the snap size.
13:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Hmm okay. Regular resending might still lead to lags due to high packet output =\
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 the map has teleporters and the spawn is pretty far away from the rest of the map, also /pause of course, those lead to many connects and disconnects
14:05 < Oy> yeah, snapshot size is 64k
14:05 < Oy> putting the player data in the snap would in the worst case take about 32k
14:05 < Oy> just for that
14:17 <@Dune> hey Oy
14:17 <@Dune> not sure what you mean with filling with whitespaces
14:17 <@Dune> shouldn't we just use a aBuf[4] ?
14:19 < Oy> Dune: if the word has to be at least 3 chars in lengh, fill the missing one with a space
14:19 <@Dune> minimum size is not a problem, maximum is
14:20 <@Dune> it's okay if they translate by "NE", not by "NETT"
14:20 < Oy> ah, then i misread it :)
14:20 <@Dune> (would overflow)
14:20 < Oy> yeah, then just clamp it
14:20 <@Dune> alright
14:21 < Oy> though wouldn't use a buf[4]
14:21 < Oy> keep utf8 in mind
14:21 <@Dune> ah
14:21 < Oy> cut it after 3 chars
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> buf4 -> buffour -> buffer lol
14:21 <@Dune> with str_format size param?
14:21 <@Dune> i think this is in bytes too
14:22 < Oy> yeah
14:22 < Oy> ptobably have to write sth
14:22 <@Dune> okay
14:24 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/base/system.c#L2421
14:24 < Oy> for loop
14:25 < Oy> maybe add a function in base/system.c for it?
14:25 <@Dune> it's a bit of a hacky solution anyway
14:25 <@Dune> character width not a constant etc
14:26 <@Dune> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/ff8efb6a4a84a5b085fd9cd3adb6d6e2/image.png
14:27 <@Dune> Transifex lets us set a hard character limit
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @fokkonaut by default the client only sends snapshots in every second tick. Try to send the connect/disconnect stuff in a tick where no snap is sent. Are you flushing the connection?
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> When you are only sending the players that actually changed I think the whole thing should work somehow. When you are sending more than that, there are probably too many packets
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> of course it works somehow, but it is just too laggy sometimes
15:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Yeah, maybe because of too many packets at once
15:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> when joining `176.9.114.238:9303` my client keeps crashing
15:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> (0.7)
15:07 < gerdoe> ddnet lol
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> oh yeah its a ddnet server
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Map seems broken. The client is stuck in a loop because of a broken envelope item.
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> nice, new method for client crasher
15:14 <@Dune> corrupt maps tend to crash the client
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> shouldn't the client be more stable concerning this?
15:15 <@Dune> shoulds are many, dos are rarer
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I think this is the one time where a try-catch clause is a good use
15:16 <@Dune> ew
15:17 <@Dune> that wouldn't solve out of bound accesses etc.
15:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Does teeworlds has any kind of error logs?
15:19 <@Dune> the console
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I mean some kind of post client crash logging, with an unhandled exception handler
15:21 <@Dune> no
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Crashing the client is really easy. There is hardly any validation when loading maps and even the snapshot code still has some issues
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I always thought you want the client to be as stable as possible ^^ but okay
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ^I should clarify this
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I thought you want the client fully stable, so every error case is handled
15:32 <@Dune> that would be good, yes
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Yeah that would definitely be good, but nobody really looked into this so far
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> please no exceptions in teeworlds
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> A lot of the datafile code needs checks though, if someone cba to go through it
15:47 <@Dune> yeah
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> in case someone wants to fix the map: `NUT_hardcore_best` (on the ddner server @Assa mentioned) has a `CMapItemEnvelope` with `m_Channels = 8`. The value should be clamped to 1-3. DDNet does not really use it when loading a map but 0.7 gets stuck in this loop due to a buffer overflow:
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/60bfb5615e26d07afa294e8af1e44808a036068d/src/game/client/components/maplayers.cpp#L257-L264
16:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> there is an issue with the asynchronous rendering in macOS and this time I don't know how to fix it
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The main dispatch queue is running in our initial thread, when we call swap it causes a dispatch in sdl, however right after that we waitforidle
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> thus the dispatch queue never runs again
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> thus the dispatch from sdl never goes through, thus the graphics thread is stuck
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> on macOS we can't afford to not SDL_PollEvent for a while
17:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> hm, I guess they could be doing an async dispatch instead
17:17 < Learath2> Well I’ll commit it and hope icculus doesn’t be an ass
17:17 < Learath2> That doesn’t sound right
23:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> should we maybe remove cust om colors setting? its not a custom color anymore since it is turned on for default colors too
23:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> should we maybe remove custom colors setting? its not a custom color anymore since it is turned on for default colors too
23:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what colors are you talking about?
