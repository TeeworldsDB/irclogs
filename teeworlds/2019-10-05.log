10:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh sick thanks ill try
10:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> omg old editor is back! Ur a hero ‚ù§ @BeaR 
10:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> do u still play btw?
12:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <BeaR> No only occasionally
14:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> aha  "I am a big fan of zooz"
14:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @ChillerDragon
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no secret lol
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> meh why can a client be dropped two times in a row without connecting?
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> http://paste.pr0.tips/qv
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon perhaps there's no join message on the same level
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> you mean log verbosity level?
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> or what level are you talking about?
16:37 < rand> did the player joins a secondtime ?
16:38 < rand> -s
16:38 < rand> I suspect that the client was banned right after it connected
16:39 < rand> client drops are on server engine level
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> idk i only have the log and the log says he dropped twice in a row without any join message in between
16:40 < rand> I guess you can drop before beeing ingame
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea but i didnt expect a drop before this message ``[server]: player has entered the game. ClientID=1 addr=XXX``
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe before [game]: team_join player='1:nameless tX' team=1
16:42 < rand> It's basically what happens when pressing Enter three time when selecting a server (connect, cancel, connect)
16:42 < rand> now, you know :)
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> could not reproduce it this way tho
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i expected at least this before a drop ``[server]: player is ready. ClientID=1 addr=XXX``
17:07 < rand> maybe you need a slow connection
17:07 < rand> in order to be in connecting state while being banned
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ya maybe
17:08 < rand> does it break some script ?
17:09 < rand> fortunately, leaving player that should not be there is easier to manage than actions from player that should not be there

17:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> my console gets spammed by this, any ideas? after server restart it was gone but its there again
17:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> only about 15 people online
17:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it started after i updated my mod to master
17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it seems to happen when I kill myself
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i will try to make a simple player check, before sending the message, might work
17:28 < rand> looks like the server engine tries to send to the 49 missing clients
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea, thats why i added a check now
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But it worked before too, since the kill message update this comes up
17:30 < rand> it sounds like the code in CCharacter::Die is fautly then
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i didnt change my code.
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L697
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> also here, in vanilla, it doesnt check. wonder if this appears there too
17:31 < rand> test !Server()->ClientIngame(i) might be incomplet
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ah there it is
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no, i dont have this check in my mod
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> that was the mistake
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i added it, but just didnt spot it in vanilla :D
17:34 < rand> I'm glad this was solved in no time :D
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes it broke my log script but i changed it from a error to a warning. so at least it doesnt crash anymore but now i am less strict in case my script actually messes something up :c
