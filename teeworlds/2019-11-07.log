01:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> just compiled teeworlds on windows 10 with cmake
01:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> now i want to kill myself
09:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :0
09:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 1:04 in the morning, classic.
13:06 < day> ffs dune
13:06 < day> wb dune
13:06 < Dune_> thanks day
13:06 < day> whats going on with your internets
13:06 < Dune_> broken bouncer :(  gotta set up my own
13:06 < day> i see
13:07 < day> just wondering, do you play dota?
13:07 < day> dota2*
13:07 < Dune_> never got the courage to update on the hero stuff from HoN
13:07 < Dune_> so nah
13:07 < day> i see
13:07 < day> i thought you might have transitioned 
13:08 < Dune_> my team kinda did, but I took that opportunity to stop mobas :p
13:08 < day> sad thing is, the hon client is still much nicer than the dota2 client kek
13:08 < Dune_> they cut linux support actually
13:08 < Dune_> teeworlds>hon confirmed
13:08 < day> both do
13:08 < Dune_> although I heard archlinux was a pain for a while in early 0.7 :p
13:09 < day> hon had his fair share of linux bugs too
13:09 < Dune_> dota cut linux support? huh
13:09 < day> eh what?
13:09 < Dune_> hon had bugs on every OS which makes it fair
13:09 < Dune_> >  12:08:35 both do
13:09 < day> i mean hon literally crashed when you casted a certain skill :D
13:09 < day> dota2 has linux support
13:09 < Dune_> isn't teeworlds inspired of quake bug abuses
13:10 < Dune_> or was the whole rocketjumping thing fully intended
13:11 < day> dota2 turbo is pretty neat to get to know the game, because noone seems to give a shit on how you perform
13:11 < Dune_> never heard of that
13:12 < day> just a different queue with more exp/money
13:12 < Dune_> so casual mode
13:12 < day> it simply accelerates the game
13:12 < Dune_> what would such a mode look like in teeworlds 
13:12 < Dune_> instagib? :p
13:16 < day> nah DD race
13:31 < Dune_> I believe DDRace is casual also because it's PvE
17:07 < Dune_> hey fstd
17:10 < bridge_> [freenode] <fstd> hi Dune_
17:12 < Dune_>  fstd: do you remember what you were doing in april, 8 years ago?
17:12 < Dune_> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/134#issuecomment-1050114
17:14 < bridge_> [freenode] <fstd> i have faint memories of a component called the 'content server' back then, and some fetch mechanism
17:14 < bridge_> [freenode] <fstd> but i think that was 0.5, and i don't think i have any of that anymore :/
17:15 < Dune_> I see :D
