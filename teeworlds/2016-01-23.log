15:37 < EastByte> minus: may I ask how the tw masterservers currently are managing 0.6 and 0.7 servers at the same time?
15:38 <@minus> 3 for 0.6, 1 for 0.7
15:38 <@minus> latter was an accident but i just left it running
15:38 < EastByte> well, that makes sense
15:39 < EastByte> so basically all of the masterserver are partly receiving invalid requests
15:40 < EastByte> well, not that it matters
15:41 <@minus> yes
