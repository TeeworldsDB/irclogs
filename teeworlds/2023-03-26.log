10:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Donâ€™t use docker corporate bloat trash
10:33 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Gimme ssh access and I run apt update ez
16:28 <@heinrich5991> minus: that's your blog post on the hn front page? https://blog.mnus.de/2023/03/archlinux-zfs/
16:28 <@heinrich5991> I keep a archiso with zfs around for that reason
16:28 < minus> heinrich5991: yeah idk how it made it there
16:29 < minus> lol ChillerDragon
16:30 < minus> i don't think apt upgrade does anything anymore; and if it doesn't boot anymore you have to hope you can get a hold of Kottizen_
17:41 < ChillerDragon> wait wot is teeworlds.com in some kind of trouble right now? I thought you are just too lazy to maintain it.
17:55 < bridge> <ReiTW> ask someone to host it lul
18:16 < minus> not really trouble, just lazy + it's a pain
18:22 <@heinrich5991> minus: if you want, I can take over hosting teeworlds.com
18:24 < minus> sure
18:24 < minus> what's the plan, move it to your infra?
18:24 < minus> spin up some mariadb and import The Data
18:25 <@heinrich5991> yea, move it to my infra
18:26 <@heinrich5991> I don't have time tonight
18:26 <@heinrich5991> what do I need? a working php, mariadb
18:26 <@heinrich5991> something else?
18:26 < minus> incoming mail goes through my mailserver but that's fine with me because i need to run that anyway
18:26 < minus> i don't think so
18:27 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ah, I need to be able to send mail for the forum
18:27 <@heinrich5991> that's annoying
18:28 < ChillerDragon> heinrichs spam ip banned everywhere xd cuz he always sending phising mails hrhrhr
18:28 < minus> atm it just sends from the machine directly
18:28 < minus> it used to send through my mailserver, but i really didn't want that blacklisted considering the amount of spam registrations
18:29 < minus> at work i just went and set up AWS SES for sending
18:29 < minus> but that costs money (albeit a negligible amount)
18:30 < minus> >/usr/bin/webhook -nopanic -ip 127.0.0.1 -port 9010 -hooks /home/docs-updater/webhook.conf
18:30 < minus> ah yes that also exists
18:32 < bridge> <heinrich5991> what's that?
18:32 < minus> should be pretty self-explanatory, no?
18:32 <@heinrich5991> some webhook from github that rebuilds docs?
18:32 < minus> updates the docs on the website on push to the repo
18:32 < minus> yea
18:32 <@heinrich5991> I see
18:32 <@heinrich5991> looks doable. I'll look at it tomorrow
18:32 < minus> could just replace the docs with a link to the repo probably
18:33 < minus> thanks for mustering the fucks to maintain this :)
