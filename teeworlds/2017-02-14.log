14:45 <@heinrich5991> matricks: did you consider using cmake for teeworlds back when deciding to write bam?
14:47 < necropotame> heinrich5991, https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1429
14:59 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: doesn't talk about cmake
15:18 < necropotame> Oh sorry, I've read "Make" as "CMake" in #8
15:37 <@minus> CMake is terrible.
15:37 <@heinrich5991> why?
15:37 <@heinrich5991> I just used it a bit, seems quite nice
15:38 <@minus> you haven't used it enough then ._.
15:38 <@minus> but it's mainly the language
16:11 <@heinrich5991> minus: meh. I want to hear architectural problems, not "I don't like the syntax" ;)
16:13 <@matricks> heinrich5991: i considered a lot of systems when I wrote bam
16:13 <@matricks> bam predates the version you see of teeworlds
16:18 <@minus> heinrich5991: don't get me wrong, it works and supports a lot of things, but it's ugly as hell. and working with subdirectories is awkward as well
16:18 <@heinrich5991> minus: subdirectories: file(GLOB_RECURSE GAME_CLIENT "src/game/client/*.cpp" "src/client/server/*.h")
16:19 <@minus> i mean CMakeLists.txts in subdirectories
16:20 <@heinrich5991> ok, doesn't seem needed in TW's case
16:35 <@minus> i did consider CMake for teeworlds, too
16:35 <@minus> oh, another thing: generating files is also not very nice
16:37 <@heinrich5991> minus: https://gist.github.com/heinrich5991/86c9d4bd1121f08dab1db9a6f9cf34d7
16:37 <@heinrich5991> might have the advantage of actually working under windows :)
16:38 <@heinrich5991> as opposed to the patching I sometimes need to do to execute python for windows compilation
16:38 <@minus> =D
16:39 <@minus> neat
