00:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Dune: perhaps "fix spectator UI not rendering in some cases"?
00:04 < Dune> thanks heinrich5991
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> dump_binds is a clientside thing
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> tunes is serverside, binds is clientside
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The frontpage still seems to want me to download 0.7.4 btw
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/701554538468868187/Screenshot_2020-04-20_at_01.06.48.png
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> same
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @heinrich5991
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> not for me ðŸ˜›
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> now
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> heh, works for me
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> 404 though
00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> lemme fix that
00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> you can add "- remove the chat command limit" to the chat commands section
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> getting a steady 30KB/s from github.com
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> and "descriptions for console command arguments" too
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @heinrich5991 yeah it's been slow for me too
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> me3 but I have slow internet in general so I didn't think much of it
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Learath2 the descriptions part is kinda there
00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> did steam update?
00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Dune
00:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Assa oops, forgot to push it live
00:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes, i was usefull today ^^
00:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there you go
00:39 < Learath2> I guess with the release going fine I can get some sleep
00:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> zzz
10:04 < ChillerDragon> Can one please explain how to whisper to players with spaces in their name I really do not get it.
10:05 < ChillerDragon> Tested it again on 0.7.5 master server and client and could not get it working
10:06 < ChillerDragon> I mean I can still get it working by manually quoting the name.
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> NOOOOOOOO, damnit
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> that 's' should have been a 'r'
12:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It's like I've been in a state of constant brainfart for the last 2 weeks
12:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> Learath2 feelsbad xD
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> it's the stupid quarantine, it's just making me anxious
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> 0.7.5.1 incoming I feel it
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> or is it then 0.7.5.2?
12:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> idk if vanilla does hotfixes
12:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> They did already
12:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> 0.7.5.1.2.3
12:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> Omg I feel this Sonix
12:41 < ChillerDragon> 0.7 feels so early still i feel like we get until 0.7.10 at least
12:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> Then you will ask one about the version and you will say this
12:48 < Dune> @Learath2 can you PR a fix?
12:48 < Dune> (it looks quick)
13:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the pyramid of doom.
13:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *never forget*
14:27 < ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 it will return https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1587385606.png
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :0
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> one day
14:49 < Dune> ChillerDragon: :D
15:01 < ChillerDragon> meh did the log format change? My parser keeps crashing since 0.7.5 update :/
15:04 < Dune> we need a counter for "days since last log format change" as well :D
15:07 < ChillerDragon> yes pls
15:07 < ChillerDragon> how did i not notice there was a change :/
15:18 < ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 might be interesting for ur parser as well https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/5090c39d94bad0b6dda8caaef271133c46c00ee0#diff-a2df712cfb938eda9a173f36c865c2cc
15:18 < ChillerDragon> i keep starring at the two different logs and took me way too long to realize that the id position changed
15:19 < ChillerDragon> that will be a mess to still support older versions
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thx man
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/701784847953428560/IMG_20200420_152148.jpg
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> fix double :D double binds
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm
15:25 < ChillerDragon> ok its unfixable
15:26 < ChillerDragon> rip my vanilla server
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I woukd prefer team=-1 for non team chat maybe.
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> to have a better differentiation between version changes.
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the non team version switched mode integer with clientID
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's possible to detect that, but one woukd need to skip parsing messages, until an ID is seen that is bigger than the biggest possible mode, mode >= 3 or something like that, but that's kinda an ugly workaround to keep backwards compatibility
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> calibrate econ/log parsing by joining a server with 4 clients and send a chat message with each of them.
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (ugly)
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, team=-2 whisper, team=-1 global chat :0
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> would remove the need of having the mode printed.
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (spec team maybe)
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (also needs to be handled)
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the version PR woukd helo with parsing logs, sadly not with parsing econ, as I doubt that one can actually connect to the server at that stage via econ.
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> would help
15:47 < ChillerDragon> yea so econ maybe needs a get_version cmd
15:47 < ChillerDragon> or probably just version
15:48 < ChillerDragon> could also be implemented client side to get full network hash
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> "full network hash"?
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> server sends its version in the serverinfo btw
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> would be easier to change that log line order
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> than adding extra commands.
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> server info != logs != econ
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> chiller parses logs, I parse econ
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the purpose is just to differentiate the not backwards compatible chat lines. this is kinda adding too much complexity, when the root of the problem is just the order of integers on two lines.
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> in
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I see
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> can this here be called testing?
19:12 < Oy> Any problems with 0.7.5?
19:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the chat log breaks kind of backwards compatibility, because the order of two integers is switched. so parsing while maintaining comoatibility with a orevious version becomes a pain.
19:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> -o +p
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Oy #2586 :/
20:51 < Oy> needed?
20:51 < Oy> that command stuff is like a never ending nightmare ;)
20:52 < Oy> Dune: 0.7.5.1?
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> indeed @ nightmare
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I missed it while reverting that commit
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It prevents people from whispering to people with spaces in their names without quoting
20:55 < Oy> happens, don't worry
20:55 < Oy> ok
21:28 < Dune> Oy: I don't know
21:28 < ChillerDragon> ok im not sure now
21:28 < Dune> gotta be careful from now on with adding new features to this mess
21:28 < ChillerDragon> "net version" in logs or "netversion"
21:29 < ChillerDragon> my english is bad but isnt it a german thing to smash words together and proper way is splitting
21:29 < ChillerDragon> Dune: return of the pyramid incoming :D
21:29 < Dune> netversion sounds better to me
21:30 < ChillerDragon> yea i mean it would be consistent with the defines in version.h
21:30 < ChillerDragon> ok ill go with netversion
21:40 < Oy> it's not a big issue. probably happens very rare. so a new release might not be needed
21:40 < Oy> would be fine with both
21:40 < Dune> yeah I don't think it's worth
21:40 < Dune> you can still whisper using a) double quotes b) the whisper bind
21:40 < Dune> only the tab-autocompletion is broken
21:41 < Oy> yeah, ok
21:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> @Dune i still think its doable, with some tweakings
21:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes, those tweakings are the whole difficulty :)
21:59 < ChillerDragon> also wasnt the whisper history fixed? what happend to that
21:59 < ChillerDragon> i keep leaking secret messages by pressing up arrow :/
21:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you have a whisper history bug? how to reproduce?
22:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah, wait I think this is by design?
22:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> whats going on
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> is it normal that it gets stuck at a command? while cycling history
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> sss, /w8t, ttt --> cycle up ttt then /w8t and gets stuck
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> (talking about chat)
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> fix whisper bug
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> :(
22:20 < ChillerDragon> ye its design Dune pressing up arrow does not trigger last normal chat message nor last whisper it triggers last whisper message as normal chat
22:20 < ChillerDragon> so whisper and up arrow enter just leaks the message which does not make a lot of sense
22:21 < ChillerDragon> it scared me so much that i stopped whipsering in 0.7 and always use public chat :D
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> You must be whispering bank accounts
22:40 < ChillerDragon> oh men @jxsl13 i just realized i only parse logs in my tests but on production i parse econ :/ so tell me if you found a solution until then ill stay in 0.7.4
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> change order of the integers....
22:51 < ChillerDragon> meh and then break compability?
22:52 < ChillerDragon> i still host 0.6 servers with the same code base
22:52 < ChillerDragon> oh well but there i know the diff but then yea dropping everything from 0.7 until 0.7.5 meh
23:03 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/5090c39d94bad0b6dda8caaef271133c46c00ee0#diff-a2df712cfb938eda9a173f36c865c2cc
23:03 < ChillerDragon> am I being stupid here or is this unparsable?
23:04 < ChillerDragon> How do I know if it is a player with the name "1:foo" in normal chat or a team message from player "foo"
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: by the team mode
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> *chat mode
23:09 < ChillerDragon> yea just realized
23:09 < ChillerDragon> i should go to bed thanks anyways @heinrich5991
23:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I mean create a or where the order is the same as 0.7.4 and either before or after that add teamchat
23:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> pr
