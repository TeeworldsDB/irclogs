16:17 < JoeMaro> is there a way to play TW in racemode offline without launching a server?
16:17 < JoeMaro> aka: can the client somehow spawn a map and let me run around in it?
16:23 < Obani> JoeMaro, the only ways to lay locally are to open a local server
16:23 < Obani> JoeMaro, download DDNET, configure the server to start a map, to add some votes, etc
16:23 < Obani> And then launch it as local
16:24 < JoeMaro> k, thnx Obani!
16:24 < Obani> It will appear in the "local" tab of teeworlds
16:24 < JoeMaro> will look up what DDNET is
16:24 < Obani> If you need help for configuring a server, just ask JoeMaro 
16:24 < JoeMaro> sure
16:24 < Obani> JoeMaro, DDNET is the client that supports race mode
16:24 < Obani> DDRace*
16:27 < JoeMaro> is teeworlds netcode demanding? i know it's hard to measure that but lets say compared to quakeworld which uses very little bandwidth... i'm only on a mobile connection with very limited bandwidth
16:27 < Obani> JoeMaro, well, I think it's really not demanding much
16:28 < EastByte> it doesn't require much bandwidth but it doesn't work well with unstable connections
16:28 < Obani> true
16:28 < Obani> Let's say that it's unplayable :)
16:28 < JoeMaro> hmm i just could actually measure it now ... was a bit pointless asking :P thnx anyway
16:31 < JoeMaro> yes .... unplayable :D will look into DDNET later when at wifi place :D thanks a lot irc-people <3
16:32 < Obani> you're welcome :)
22:17 < deen> since there was a discussion about running a local ddnet server. you can even get all ddnet maps with a config, automatically updated: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-maps
22:18 < Obani> Well, JoeMaro isn't online so it might be kinda useless
