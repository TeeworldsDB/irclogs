01:16 < eeeee> unfortunately even that "Beautiful" python looks nowhere as good as equivalent c#
08:26 < BotoX> >C#
08:28 <@minus> :D
20:54 < Siile> hello
20:54 < Siile> anyone tried addind shaders to tws?
20:54 < Siile> *adding
20:54 <@minus> >:D
20:55 < Siile> that's a serious question >:P
20:55 <@minus> i am aware
20:56 <@matricks> Siile: what do you wanna do?
20:57 < Siile> first of all colored outlines to tees
20:57 < Siile> black is hard to color but easy with shaders
20:58 <@matricks> better to do the outline white and just color it
20:58 < Siile> u know, when tee gets hit it's outlines could flash red once or twice
20:58 <@matricks> no need for shaders for that one
20:59 < Siile> where can I find it?
20:59 <@matricks> it's in the skin files
20:59 < Siile> lol
20:59 <@matricks> dunno how it looks now adays
20:59 < Siile> so I should change all the skin files? :D
20:59 <@matricks> yeah?
21:00 < Siile> haha
21:00 < Siile> no ty
21:00 < Siile> easier too implement shaders 
21:00 <@matricks> too much work doing it the right way?
21:00 < Siile> and smarter
21:00 < Siile> y
21:00 <@minus> Siile: do shaders, and add distortion effects. people love distortion/glitch effects.
21:01 <@matricks> Siile: if you just wanna do the body outline.. it's 4 pngs
21:01 <@matricks> its like 10 pngs to change all in all
21:02 <@matricks> and the change is easy... should take 1 minute each
21:02 < Siile> I have skin pack downloaded so...
21:02 < Siile> and 1 minute / each is too much
21:02 < Siile> it's monkey work
21:02 <@matricks> batch it
21:02 < Siile> it's not rly neat solution
21:04 <@matricks> you can also just use the alpha from the texture when rendering
21:05 <@matricks> oh.. wait.. you kinda need to redo the graphics.. part of the outline is rendered into the graphics
21:05 <@matricks> for the decorations atleast
21:06 <@matricks> and hands
21:06 < Siile> sfml & opengl was so easy ;___;
21:06 < Siile> i just tossed something to shader and got new stuff drawn
21:07 <@minus> i have tried numerous times with opengl and different frameworks, none was easy or well-working
21:08 <@matricks> minus: sdl seems usuallt like the least worse, loads of nice fixes in sdl2 as well
21:08 < heinrich5991> sdl2 works nicely with my WM. very much appreciated :)
21:08 < EastByte> ^ agree
21:08 <@minus> please complete SDL2 OpenGL 3 (would like 4, but radeon does not support that iirc) skeleton, thanks.
21:09 < Siile> tried sfml?
21:09 < Siile> it's like:
21:09 < Siile> sf::Shader::bind(&motionShader);
21:09 < Siile> glBegin(GL_QUADS);
21:09 < Siile> ...
21:10 < Siile> all kinds of light and glow effects are super easy with shaders
21:10 < heinrich5991> do we want 'all kinds of light and glow effects'? :)
21:11 < Siile> well, I do
21:11 < Siile> that's why I'm asking :D
21:11 < heinrich5991> =)
21:11 <@minus> > glBegin
21:11 <@minus> this is not 1999
21:11 < Siile> close enought
21:12 < EastByte> glad I'm using webgl being free of deprecated stuff :D
21:14 <@matricks> Siile: anyway, there are no shader support in teeworlds at the moment at all, so that has to be added
21:14 <@matricks> if you want it
21:18 < Siile> well, I guess I just have to add it then
21:18 <@matricks> look at how the texture loading is handled
21:19 <@matricks> it should show you how you load some stuff on the main thread and pass it over to the rendering thread
21:19 < Siile> cool
21:20 < Siile> file?
21:20 <@matricks> erh
21:20 <@matricks> src/engine/clint/*
21:20 <@matricks> client
21:20 < Siile> ty
21:27 < Siile> I was also planning joypad support :D
21:27 <@matricks> dual stick works quite nice
21:27 < EastByte> I want rift support
21:27 < Siile> already done?
21:27 <@matricks> Siile: tried it out over 10 years ago
21:28 < Siile> nice
21:28 <@matricks> but as it is a pc game it felt unnessesary to add it to this version
21:29 < Siile> I see your point
21:29 < Siile> but worth trying :)))
21:29 <@matricks> as I said, i've tried it
21:29 <@matricks> :P
21:29 < heinrich5991> Siile: does SDL2 have support for this?
21:30 <@matricks> heinrich5991: support for what?
21:30 < heinrich5991> joypad
21:30 <@matricks> yeah
21:50 <@minus> a pad of joy, how nice
22:11 < Siile> haha, it's working (kinda)!
22:35 < Siile> 	virtual void ShaderBegin(int ShaderNum);
22:35 < Siile> 	virtual void ShaderEnd();
22:35 < Siile> it's actually working as it should >:D
22:39 < Siile> http://ninslash.com/teescreens/shaders.png
22:40 < Siile> needs still some fine adjustment but it's basically there and working
22:42 < Siile> now I just have to import my old shader, pass texture to it and finally, my black aint black no more
22:42 <@matricks> and how do you draw black when you want to draw black? :D
22:43 < Siile> I pass wanted color to my shader and it changes it
22:43 < Siile> pixel shader
22:43 < Siile> and ofc I dont have to use it if I dont want :P
22:43 <@matricks> so.. you just gonna override the color of the texture?....
22:44 < Siile> y
22:44 <@matricks> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sJJDxcXZbXA/UO2z-0H1guI/AAAAAAAAAC0/fD6Y26KnjOk/s1600/Facepalm.png
22:44 < Siile> like this but only for outlines: http://ninja.pusku.com/teaser1.png
22:45 < Siile> wrote it for my old project (in pic)
22:45 <@matricks> but as I said.. some of the outlines are baked into the texture....
22:45 < Siile> also could add some motion blur to hadouken
22:45 < Siile> it doesn't matter
22:45 < Siile> I can pass the texture to shader and it draws it to screen
22:46 <@matricks> how are you going to filter out whats a outline and not?
22:46 < Siile> I dont have to
22:46 < Siile> I draw tee without outlines over it
22:46 <@matricks> so you are going to color everything
22:46 <@matricks> ....
22:47 <@matricks> you can't draw a tee without outlines...
22:47 < Siile> hmm?
22:47 < Siile> just did
22:47 < Siile> SelectSprite(SPRITE_TEE_BODY, 0, 0, 0);
22:47 < Dunedune> well it's gonna be ugly
22:47 < Siile> wanna bet?
22:47 < Siile> :D
22:47 < Dunedune> isn't it?
22:47 <@matricks> Siile: some of the images for the tee has outlines built into them
22:47 < Siile> hmm
22:47 < Dunedune> taking bets :p
22:47 <@matricks> Siile: the art-style has inner and outer outlines
22:48 <@matricks> the inner outlines are smaller and baked into the normal bitmap
22:48 <@matricks> the thicker outline is separate
22:48 < Siile> even if it fails...
22:49 < Siile> motion blur works every time
22:49 <@matricks> and doesn't fit the art-style... but sure
22:49 < Siile> art style can be changed :P
22:50 <@matricks> sure, but it seems like you just wanna hammer in some effects
22:50 < Siile> for now, yes
22:51 < Siile> thats a start
22:52 <@matricks> you wanna hammer in some effects.. but not change the pngs...
22:52 < Siile> y
22:52 < Siile> this engine has lots of potential imo
22:53 <@matricks> what that engine needs is a clean up
22:53 < Siile> I'd prefer visual improvements
22:53 < Siile> already improved many small things
22:53 < Siile> like static camera, eyes, feet ect.
22:54 <@matricks> what have you done with the eyes and feet?
22:54 < Siile> try my client and see if you notice any different there
22:54 <@matricks> Siile: source?
22:54 < Siile> http://youtu.be/kQ8_R510hhQ
22:54 < Nimda3> [YouTube] Title: Tee Defence boss fight | Rating: 0.00/5.00 | Views: 48
22:54 <@matricks> I know that there is a size descrepency when it comes to the feet at least
22:55 <@matricks> low-pass filter in the feet
22:55 < Siile> guess what I did with the static camera
22:55 < Siile> 			m_Center2 = m_pClient->m_LocalCharacterPos + CameraOffset;
22:55 < Siile> 			m_Center.x += (m_Center2.x-m_Center.x) / 2.0f;
22:55 < Siile> 			m_Center.y += (m_Center2.y-m_Center.y) / 2.0f;
22:56 < Siile> feels a lot better even if it basically looks the same
22:56 <@matricks> oh.. thats baaad....
22:56 <@matricks> you can't do it like that...
22:56 < Siile> y, but it works
22:56 <@matricks> no.. it doesn't
22:56 < Siile> try my client
22:56 <@matricks> it will brake if you get lower framerate
22:57 <@matricks> break
22:57 < Siile> ofc it will
22:57 < heinrich5991> you call that 'work'?
22:57 < Siile> but I have a proper computer :D
22:57 <@matricks> and act differently depending on the framerate...
22:57 < Siile> true
22:57 <@matricks> == not working
22:57 <@matricks> == buggy
22:57 <@matricks> guess you did the low-pass filter on the feet the same?
22:57 < Siile> y
22:57 < Siile> eyes and weapon too
22:58 < Siile> haters gonna hate
22:58 < Siile> but it feels 9000x better now
22:58 <@matricks> the camera looked nice, but you must fix the bugs
22:58 < Siile> why? it's not made for every client
22:58 <@matricks> just for you then
22:59 < Siile> and for everyone else who dont have a wooden computer :P
22:59 <@matricks> but faster computers will behave differently as well
22:59 <@matricks> and that effect won't happen at all more or less
22:59 <@matricks> all depends on the framerate
22:59 <@matricks> and that is really really bad
23:00 < Siile> v-sync should help
23:00 <@matricks> no...
23:00 <@matricks> vsync != 60hz
23:00 <@matricks> thats no garantuee
23:01 <@matricks> but I liked the effect on the camera however
23:01 < Siile> me2
23:01 < Siile> spend full 2 minutes designing it
23:02 < Siile> time well spent
23:02 <@matricks> but as I said, it's not done
23:02 < Siile> I know
23:02 < Siile> or it's very badly done, but I dont rly care as long as it looks good on my computer :P
23:03 < Siile> there's like 3 ppl using my client so...
23:03 <@matricks> it's like pissing your pants, you can do it quicker, but you gotta clean it up as well
23:03 <@matricks> which takes longer
23:03 < Siile> not rly
23:03 < Siile> I dont get wet
23:03 <@matricks> yeah, but the task isn't done
23:04 < Siile> just some random guys who try my client with crappy computers :P
23:04 < Dunedune> it's not just crappy computers... good computers with high frame rate will look buggy too iirc
23:04 < Dunedune> if I understood it right*
23:04 <@matricks> I said that
23:04 <@matricks> it's framerate dependent
23:04 < Siile> actually they will look just like normal tws
23:04 < Siile> maybe a little bit better
23:04 < Dunedune> you're not thinking about distributing it yet, but when you want to upscale it, you won't be able to and will regret that
23:05 < Siile> there's not much to be distributed
23:05 <@matricks> learn the lessons of the DOS times.. don't write framerate dependent code :)
23:05 <@matricks> there is loads of tickrate dependent code in teeworlds however :)
23:05 < Dunedune> I don't think it's an acceptable mindset to not look into problems because they don't appear on your computer
23:05 < Dunedune> soon or later you'll have to face them
23:06 < Dunedune> but again, I guess you'll learn from your mistakes (or prove me wrong and not regret it at all)
23:06 < Siile> i know but right now I enjoy playing too much to spent time fixing bugs I dont (yet) have to face
23:06 < Dunedune> rly not the right mindset imo, but it's up to you :/
23:06 <@matricks> Siile: problem is that you tend to forget that they are there...
23:06 <@matricks> and then they come back to bit you in the ass, or someone else
23:07 < Dunedune> matricks: how is the tickrate depend thing a matter?
23:07 < Dunedune> in case you want to port code to another project or?
23:08 <@matricks> Dunedune: well, you can't just change the tickrate from 50 to 1000 without changing a couple of scale values etc as well
23:08 <@matricks> but the tickrate is the same for everyone so
23:08 < Dunedune> and these can't be computed from the tickrate?
23:08 < Dunedune> using the*
23:08 <@matricks> Dunedune: they do stuff like siile did... * scale_value each tick etc
23:09 <@matricks> todo some smooth stuff
23:09 < Dunedune> arrk
23:09 <@matricks> there shouldn't be that much however
23:09 < Dunedune> i wanna try and fuck up the tickrate now :p
23:09 <@matricks> hehe
23:10 <@matricks> I don't think most values are scaled with tickrate
23:10 <@matricks> but it should be really simple going through gamecore.cpp to fix it
23:10 < Dunedune> what's gonna be the main effects of changing the tickrate? more/less responsiveness I guess?
23:10 < Siile> well, at least my shader code is done the right way ^______^
23:10 < Siile> ....i guess
23:10 < Siile> took it from some SDL glsl example :D
23:10 < Siile> works like a charm
23:11 < Siile> I'm going to hit the bed now
23:11 <@matricks> Dunedune: a bit yes
23:11 < Siile> bb
23:11  * matricks watches a couple of videos
23:12 < Dunedune> be gentle with the bed siile
23:14 <@matricks> http://vimeo.com/95754401
23:14 <@matricks> seems like fun :D
23:30 < Dunedune> dayum netversion hash
23:33 < Dunedune> hmmm I don't notice anything different
23:33 < Dunedune> maybe i should lower it
23:33 <@matricks> ?
23:33 < Dunedune> doubled framerate
23:34 <@matricks> doubled tickrate you mean?
23:34 <@matricks> the tickrate is a part of the protocol
23:34 <@matricks> both server and client knows that it's 50hz
23:35 < Dunedune> yeah i fixed that
23:35 < Dunedune> yeah, tickrate
23:35 < Dunedune> I halved it and now projectiles go super fast and laggy
23:36 < Dunedune> but explosions still come later ofc
23:36 <@matricks> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/gamecore.h#L86
23:36 <@matricks> check for where that is used :)
23:37 < Dunedune> oh actually grenades go slower in 100tickrate
23:37 < Dunedune> and they expire rly soon
23:37 <@matricks> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/components/items.cpp#L46
23:39 < Dunedune> aye
23:39 < Dunedune> but doesn't server send its own tick speed?
23:40 < Dunedune> or client assumes server has same tickspeed since there is the nethash check?
23:40 <@matricks> the client assumes that it uses the same tickspeed as the server
23:40 < Dunedune> o
23:40 < Dunedune> ok
23:40 <@matricks> TICKSPEED == 50hz is a part of the protocol
23:40 < Dunedune> yeah makes sense
23:40 <@matricks> like max players == 16
23:40 <@matricks> etc
23:43 < Dunedune> oh, it crashed o_o
23:44 < Dunedune> guess it could be because of alt+F4, still weird
