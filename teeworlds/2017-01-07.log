11:43 < YoungFlyme> Hey guys, i got 1 question ^^ What does "var % 2" mean? varÂ²?
11:48 < EastByte> % is the modulo operator
11:49 < necropotame> It's the rest of the division: 5%2=1
11:52 < YoungFlyme> ok thx ^^
15:20 < _deep5me> hi
15:21 < _deep5me> could someone help me to compile on mac 10.11 please?
15:21 < necropotame> For TeeWorlds 0.6.4 or a modified version ?
15:22 < _deep5me> teeworlds 0.6.4
15:23 < Obani> do you have bam ?
15:23 < _deep5me> sure
15:23 < Obani> 4 or 5 ?
15:23 < _deep5me> 5
15:23 < Obani> so
15:23 < Obani> do this
15:23 < Obani> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/d6f3cc159257a2d6033e3ef46906c72c9db1b9eb
15:29 < Obani> _deep5me, ?
15:29 < _deep5me> cloned the newest version for test and I get like million of errors
15:30 < Obani> _deep5me, what newest version ?
15:30 < _deep5me> from teeworlds
15:30 < _deep5me> $ git clone https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds.git
15:36 < _deep5me> for now it can't find SDL/SDL2. I put both in /Library/Frameworks (SDL.framework and SDL2.framework)
15:40 < _deep5me> where do bam search for sdl?
16:12 < Obani> I don't know
16:12 < Obani> Didn't you want to compile 0.6.4 ?
16:15 < _deep5me> Yes
16:16 < Obani> Well
16:16 < Obani> Last source is 0.7
16:16 < Obani> 0.6.4 is linked on the website :)
16:17 < necropotame> TeeWorlds 0.6.4 use SDL, not SDL2, as far as know. It seems strange that you need it
16:18 < Obani> If he has last sources from github
16:18 < Obani> It wouldn't be surprising
16:18 < necropotame> I don't understand why 0.6 is not the default branch
16:19 < Obani> because it doesn't need to be
16:19 < Obani> as it's no longer being develed
16:29 < _deep5me> Damn it ._.
16:40 < Obani> 0.7 is the next one
16:40 < Obani> it should be released in 2030
16:42 < kidanger> hype
17:57 < _deep5me> I get this error now "SDL for Mac OS X only supports deploying on 10.6 and above." (Installed SDL2 via $ brew install sdl2)
20:23 < necropotame> http://xkcd.com/1782
22:59  * minus is using tmux+weechat
22:59  * minus is from the future
23:04 < necropotame> punched card-based client based :P
23:04 < necropotame> -based*
