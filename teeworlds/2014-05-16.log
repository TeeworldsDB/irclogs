01:42 < goo> how do i run teeworlds_srv from terminal in linux?
01:48 < goo> i am in the directory, but when i do teeworlds_srv -f serverconfig it says "teeworlds_srv: command not found" i checked spelling
01:49 < goo> when i put just teeworlds_srv it says the same
02:17 < goo> i get permission denid :(
02:18 < heinrich5991> goo: try ./teeworlds_srv
02:21 < goo> i did that and got permission denied
02:21 < goo> even with super user
02:23 < heinrich5991> ahh
02:23 < heinrich5991> don't use super user
02:23 < heinrich5991> try
02:23 < heinrich5991> chmod +x teeworlds_srv
02:23 < heinrich5991> and then try again with ./teeworlds_srv
02:23 < heinrich5991> chmod +x makes things executable
02:23 < heinrich5991> goo: ^
02:24 < goo> thanks! it worked
02:25 < goo> but now its running in my remote terminal :/ will look at setting up a way to execute it otherwise
02:25 < heinrich5991> press ctrl-c
02:25 < goo> im looking at the posts on the tw forum
02:26 < heinrich5991> then
02:26 < heinrich5991> screen
02:26 < heinrich5991> execute teeworlds there
02:26 < heinrich5991> then you can detach with "ctrl-a d"
02:26 < heinrich5991> and later re-attach with screen -r
02:26 < goo> ok thanks :D
02:26 < heinrich5991> goo: what server os do you have?
02:26 < goo> latest ubuntu
02:26 < heinrich5991> k
02:27 < goo> why?>
02:27 < heinrich5991> if you had a distro with the systemd init system I would have suggested you to use it
02:27 < heinrich5991> but you don't, and I don't know upstart well enough
02:28 < heinrich5991> but I need to go to sleep
02:29 < heinrich5991> goo: d night :D
02:29 < goo> heinrich5991: thanks, night dude

16:50 <@minus> might wanna add a "have" there

17:00 < heinrich5991> الموسوعة الحرة التي يستطيع الجميع تحريرها. 
17:00 < heinrich5991> wow, shows correctly in my client
17:00 < heinrich5991> but the cursor position when inputting it is incorrect
17:01 <@minus> mh
17:01 <@minus> looks wrong here, i think
17:02 < heinrich5991> "markieren" (whatever this is in english) is utterly broken though
17:03 < heinrich5991> i.e. moves text around
17:03 <@minus> selecting
17:03 < heinrich5991> selecting, right
