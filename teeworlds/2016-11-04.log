11:52 < askermod_> no one care :D ? rly nice
11:53 < laxa> askermod_: people are idling there, most of them have a busy life and probably work
11:54 < laxa> you need to wait few hours to have an answer
11:54 < laxa> [09:14:51] <askermod> ah guys i cant play my favorite mod i know you can fix it :/
11:54 < laxa> maybe we don't want/have time to fix stuff
