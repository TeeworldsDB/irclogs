06:02 < JulianAssange> i think she was abused btw
07:17 < JulianAssange> ty 4 follow BotoX '
08:33 <@minus> so you jumped the twatter train
08:34 <@minus> *twitter
09:52 < JulianAssange> BotoX: http://i.imgur.com/7GrQ0Ju.jpg all sealed :D
09:55 <@minus> but they're exposed to light!
09:59 < JulianAssange> those acrylic cases are uv protected

13:18 <@minus> what's a simple-to-parse, hierarchical, human-readable file format?
13:19 <@matricks> json?
13:20 <@minus> except json (also, not /that/ simple to parse)
13:20 <@minus> .ini is simple to parse, but not hierarchical
13:20 < heinrich5991> minus: yaml?
13:21 <@minus> looked at the wiki article, seems quite complex
13:21 <@minus> syntaxwise and especially for parsing
13:21 <@matricks> minus: sexpr?
13:21 <@minus> never heard of that
13:22 <@minus> a.b.c=value?
13:22 <@matricks> s-expressions, comes from lisp etc
13:23 <@matricks> minus: "a.b.c=value" is just key-value, not hierarchical
13:24 <@minus> sexpr seems too complicated for the uneducated user
13:24 <@minus> maybe something indention-based is worth a try
13:25 <@matricks> it's gets iffy really fast with people mixing tab and spaces
13:25 <@minus> forbid space :D
13:25 <@minus> only tabs
13:26 <@matricks> what do you need it for?
13:26 <@minus> config format
13:26 <@minus> config files
13:26 <@matricks> isn't key=value enough?
13:26 <@matricks> you could order key value into heiracical when it gets into the engine if you want
13:27 <@minus> a.b.c style?
13:27 <@matricks> yeah
13:27 <@matricks> or a/b/c a:b:c etc etc
13:27 <@minus> looks ugly :(
13:27 <@matricks> gets a bit repetative in the files however
13:27 <@minus> yep
13:28 <@matricks> then you have to go with some sort of {} () etc etc
13:28 <@minus> yep
13:28 <@minus> and then it's probably better to conform with JSON
13:29 <@minus> or with ini style:
13:29 <@minus> [a.b]
13:29 <@minus> c=blubb
13:29 <@matricks> sure
13:29 <@minus> that might actually be the best solution
13:29 <@minus> honestly, i'd prefer indention based stuff, but that's just me i guess
14:44 < BotoX> And why do you not want to use JSON?
14:49 <@minus> because that's not very simple to parse
14:49 <@minus> BotoX: it's simple but not very simple
14:49 < BotoX> https://github.com/udp/json-parser
14:50 < BotoX> works for meâ„¢
14:50 <@minus> i'd like to avoid dependenciese
14:51 <@minus> -e
14:51 < BotoX> that's just a .c and header file
14:51 <@minus> also, json does not enforce formatting
14:51 < BotoX> so?
14:51 <@minus> i.e. might yield unreadable configs
14:52 < BotoX> Well, you can run it through https://github.com/udp/json-parser
14:52 < BotoX> http://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/
14:52 < BotoX> meant to link this ^
14:53 <@minus> no.
14:53 < BotoX> if the user is dumb then let him be dumb
14:55 <@matricks> minus: most formats doesn't enforce formatting
14:55 < JulianAssange> minus: use uh
14:55 < JulianAssange> seralize
14:55 < JulianAssange> that's easy to read
14:55 < JulianAssange> unless that's json idk. i use it in php
14:55 <@minus> ini style pretty much does, matricks
15:00 <@matricks> [ rjlkdjfg  g                ]
15:00 <@matricks>        jkldfg            =                  lkjng
15:03 <@minus> who says you can't disallow spaces
15:04 < BotoX> I wish PHP would enforce formatting ;_;
15:04 < BotoX> Every time I look at PHP code my eyes start bleeding
15:04 <@matricks> minus: allowing formatting is good to allow users to make their configs readable
15:07 < Learath2> id go for yaml really its not that complex
15:54 < Edible> why use json when you can use xml?
15:55 <@matricks> he wanted a simple format
15:55 < Edible> what about ini?
15:55 <@matricks> Edible: read the debate, you are taking this into circles
15:57 < Edible> no circles!? I am purposeless 
16:24 <@minus> i intend to use xml for the specification
16:24 <@minus> that, or stay with python code
16:28 < masoudd_> what specification?
16:30 < heinrich5991> minus: python code should be fine, too
16:30 < heinrich5991> more flexible, although one should not use untrusted config files
16:30 <@minus> that's not for the config files themselves
16:30 <@minus> only the definition
22:14 <@matricks> hmm
22:14 <@matricks> something is a bit weird with the cpu usage in teeworlds..
22:16 < BotoX> http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/
22:16 <@minus> http://uid0.eu/V8p.png ntfs dead, can't mount :(
22:16 <@matricks> booho
22:16 <@matricks> BotoX: that game is addicting, I've only played it two times, I don't dare to play it more
22:16 < BotoX> hehe
22:17 <@matricks> don't remember my record either :/
22:22 <@matricks> wow, I'm screwing this up bad :D
22:24 <@matricks> okey, one more try :D
22:26 < BotoX> https://i.botox.bz/1394745964.png
22:26 < BotoX> damn it
22:26 <@matricks> score?
22:26 <@minus> what's that?
22:27 <@matricks> BotoX: that looks somewere I died as well
22:29 <@matricks> minus: stupid little web game
22:43 < BotoX> WOW
22:43 < BotoX> I accidently pressed up: https://i.botox.bz/1394746996.png
22:43 <@matricks> score? :)
22:44 < BotoX> there's score? D:
22:44 < BotoX> already restarted
22:44 <@matricks> ...
22:44 <@matricks> check the page ffs
22:44 < BotoX> best 7500
22:45 <@matricks> sound like the area I was before.. around 8000
22:45 <@matricks> I'm at 5800 right now
22:46 <@matricks> current run
22:53 < BotoX> https://i.botox.bz/1394747582.png
22:53 < BotoX> well fuck
22:53 < BotoX> gg ;_;
22:54 <@matricks> bleh
22:54 <@matricks> 7120 before I got screwed
