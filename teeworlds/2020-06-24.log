00:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @redix first of all, the local player might want to change his name, shocker i know
00:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> second, the names have been used to display levels in certain servers since before 0.5
00:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> third, dropping a player and re-joining it to change one field of information is the hackiest thing I have ever heard in my life and I've heard of the inverse square root hack in quake
00:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Learath2 i don't know many games where you can change your name *during* a game
00:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> why can't you wait next game? it's confusing
00:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> fourth, if you don't like people changing names on your server, just don't allow it, not very tough, just don't forward the changeinfo packet along, fine
00:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> without a changeinfo packet, we actually can't do the things we want, while it'd be trivial to enforce your restriction even with it
00:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Dune afaik all source games allow it
00:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> source?
00:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> source engine, like csgo
00:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> source engine
00:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but letting the server change the name of the client isn't really a problem either way
00:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> well I'm not a big fan of changing the name during the game in general but that's just my personal preference
00:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> the level thing sounds legit
00:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what I don't like with the current state in vanilla is that two players can have the same naem
00:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I mean when it's absolutely trivial to not allow it in your own gamemode, I don't see the issue on making things easy enough for us once
00:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Yeah the thing about duplicate names is really annoying
00:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> tbh, I never saw the benefits of moving these out of the snap
00:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> When I'm just playing the game I don't want to check IDs
00:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I guess maybe we saved a couple bytes per tee per couple dozen ticks
00:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @heinrich5991 I think that was patched out long ago?
00:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I think when a snap item it not changed, nothing will be sent
00:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> So it does not make a difference
00:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> the whole snap state is still out of sync with the message state, it's just not apparent anymore, yay?
00:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @redix every couple things we send a complete snap, so that saves a couple bytes per tee
00:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ticks* not things
01:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> do we?
01:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I think so,
01:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no complete snap is sent except in the beginning and when we try to recover
01:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> oh okay, so we don't even save those
01:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in the beginning it is sent a couple of times
01:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we save those
01:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> yay over the duration of thousands of ticks, we save a constant cost
01:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I think they mentioned something about this in my algorithms class, i.e. as t->+\inf a constant cost is negligable or something like that
01:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> well if we had 256+ players per server it would matter as the skin info + names would exceed the 64k snapshot size
01:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> but we dont...
01:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> anyways, whats done is done, it costs a little less like this
01:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> What I absolutely do not get is making it impossible to mutate
01:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> wtf
01:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Honestly, I considered making this change myself (albeit I thought a complete snap was sent every couple dozen ticks and I hate waste)
01:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I don't see any reason not to have a info change message, except for maybe backwards compatibility, but honestly, the old clients would behave exactly as you'd like them to believe
01:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> s\/believe$/behave
01:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Completely unaware of the info change
04:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> i dont understand how 
04:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> `'tee1' changed name to 'name2'`
04:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> 
04:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> is more confusing than 
04:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> `'tee1' left the game`
04:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> `'name2' entered and joined the red team`
04:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> at least with the first option its obvious that its a namechange
04:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> @jxsl13 i also dont see how it prevents faking as they could do the same thing there too
04:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> @Dune but people on 0.7 dont seem to namechange any less, idk its one of the realities of a game without accounts
09:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I guess in that regard my point is bullshit.
10:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @noby some saint thought of us mortals and lets us silently drop and add clients, so atleast we dont get messages
10:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> lol, better than nothing i suppose
12:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @noby I don't see a problem with that, but I still don't see the need to namechange *during* a game
12:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> wouldnt it be the same reasons anyone changes name in general
12:26 < ChillerDragon> im name changes are useful ingame. I use them to show others how long i am afk during a ddrace for example.
12:26 < ChillerDragon> 'ChillerDragon' -> 'afk until 1pm'
12:27 < ChillerDragon> except chat spam i never noticed any bad that could come from name changes.
12:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @noby surely they can wait next gamr
12:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> chiller ye thats a good example
12:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> also servers that prevent certain names from being used unless they auth in f2 first
13:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> surely you don't think every gamemode has to have a concept of matches and games
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> prefixing playernames with ranks, levels, afk tag .. etc.
