04:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might make sense to push the c++ version to c++11 before starting to do the extensive work?
04:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> on the editor
10:39 < minus> teeworlds isn't on ≥11 yet
11:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yet
11:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Meh ./teeworlds „cl_editor 1“ does not open editor :/ can we do something about that?
11:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Especially since the new gnome removed the ctrl+shift+e shortcut it’s really annoying to click on editor using mouse
12:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> The editor does not need it
12:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon isn't there a different command ?
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon cl_editor 1 works to me
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> > The editor does not need it
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune  
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> What?
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that was for jxsl13
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ah
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> What am I doing wrong then?
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> How did you do it?
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> try it ingame
12:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> f1->cl_editor 1
12:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Well no
12:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I want it to start with editor open
12:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Pass it as command on launch
12:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> also works
12:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> For me it does not
12:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> "teeworlds.exe "cl_editor 1""
12:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I did
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Did not work
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> copy paste the command?
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> No handwritten
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> copypaste the handwritten command?
12:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/688712601756237834/image0.jpg
12:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hmm :/
12:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you should clean your laptop one day
12:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> does ./teeworlds quit work, @ChillerDragon
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yes
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Also connect
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> And all the other stuff
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> It’s maybe config vs command
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> does cl_editor 1 work ingame?
12:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yes
12:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's odd
12:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> is the client supposed to start with the editor on?
12:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> with this command
12:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yes
12:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> can confirm, doesn't work vor me either
12:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I would prefer to even directly open a map but I guess I have to wait for the new editor api
12:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I mean, I don't type anything and it opens the editor straight up
12:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> couldn't find what triggers that
12:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah, found it
12:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> client.cpp:1975 forces a start with the editor
12:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so even if you don't pass cl_editor 1 it should work, @ChillerDragon
12:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ?
12:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ?
12:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> So I can open the editor without cl_editor 1?
12:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> at start it should open
12:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> How?
12:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> magically, without you doing anything
12:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I get to the menu when I start teeworlds?
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> are you sure you're on the right branch?
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yes
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But trolls aside are you telling me no matter what you do every time you start teeworlds it opens the editor?
12:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Could you send a link to the line you found?
12:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes
12:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `sed -n 1975p src/engine/client/client.cpp`
12:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I wrote it 10 lines above
12:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Meh no sed on iOS
12:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I mean a GitHub link
12:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Well I can check it later when I’m back on laptop
12:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you have the file and the line
12:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you should be able to find it
12:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Your not very supportive today •.•
12:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lmao it says never start with editor
12:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> So how is that opening the editor for you?
12:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Did you change that to 1 in the code?
13:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I added an issue in bad english for mapvotes at the end of the game. What do you think?
13:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> btw why are there no community guidelines for issues?
13:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> pls no
13:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @jxsl13 pls no to what?
13:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no guidlines.
13:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you don't have to follow them, they can just provide a bracelet for writing better issues
13:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> 1. I have got a bug 2. This happens 3. This is supposed to happen 4. reproduction steps 5. system information
13:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think the code guidelines are intransparent as can be. issue guidelines seem to make this worse.. if not enforced it's ok.
13:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if it helps
13:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hopefully they are somewhere central and not all over the place, at least.
13:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the code guidelines aren't intransparent https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/blob/master/nomenclature.md
13:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> it really helps reading everything in teeworlds/documentation
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> but i would rename `nomenclature.md` to `code_guidelines.md` because I searched way to long
13:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> teeworlds uses the `hungarian notation` if this helps you: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungarische_Notation
13:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> guidelines seem only to apply to C++ code
13:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might be extended to capture those base files
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> written in C
13:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon so what does it say at that line?
13:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @jxsl13 they apply to C code as well
13:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> CamelCase
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Can you quote teeworlds C files that do not abide by the nomenclature?
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the str_format stuff, like most of system.c
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah well that's a lib, kinda
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that used underscore
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> uses
13:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah, baselib is out of this
13:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> sometimes one has to kinda add some functionaility there.
13:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> src/base has camelcase and underscore naming conventions. ._.
13:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> > yeah, baselib is out of this
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @ChillerDragon you are on the master branch, right? I think @Dune meant the editor branch directly opens the editor and loads a map.
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ah thanks for clearing it up @LordSk
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ofc I am on master yes
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L1975
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> And it’s forced to 0
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I wonder why tho
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> So users won't make a mistake I assume?
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I'm not quite sure
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> What kind of mistake?
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Like putting cl_editor 1 in config? Still better than putting quit in config
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Also why would one do that?
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Probably dates from before we had flags for saving in configs
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> could be removed now
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ah so all were saved by default?
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ya that’s unlucky if you close Client with open editor
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Then people can get confused
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't really see why you'd want the editor to be saved
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's just a click or a key away anywa
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ye makes no sense
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> And think about noobs opening editor by accident. They expect the game to work properly after restart
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Doesn't it?
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> It does
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I mean it does close after restart and that’s good
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But I guess we can savley remove the hardcodet line that prohibits opening editor on launch directly
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> We could but I don't really see the point ^^
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> It would drastically improve my automapper workflow
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> And also it just makes sense imo
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> just type e?
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh that’s a shortcut too?
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Thanks 🙂
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But still I think it’s a good idea
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Didn't you introduce that? :D
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> or was it @fokkonaut
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what
15:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> oh it was @Fudgy, my bad
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> ;)
16:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> docs and key bindings.
16:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hidden keys everywhere :0
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so my next mapgenerator will run directly on teeworlds with console calls
18:48 < Dune> hey oy
18:48 < Dune> should we close this then? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/552
18:48 < Oy> hey
18:49 < Dune> > When existing editor issues are already fixed in the new one they can be closed
18:49 < Oy> the new editor already supports it right?
18:49 < Dune> @LordSk
18:49 < Dune> yeah it does
18:49 < Dune> it's built with that in mind afaik
18:49 <@heinrich5991> hey :)
18:49 < Oy> yeah, think we can close it then
18:50 < Dune> what about https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1301 ?
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hey Oy 🙂
18:52 < Oy> closed that too
18:54 < Oy> heinrich5991: about the whisper. how about adding a log entry without the text? so you just know there was a whisper for moderation. in case someone complains about spam/insults
18:54 < Learath2> Oy: before you go, it'd be nice if you could give 2495 a quick merge
18:55 < Oy> done
18:56 < Learath2> ty
18:56 < Dune> btw, https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2474 does not improve the server list loading for me
18:56 < Dune> just to clear that up
18:57 < Learath2> @fokkonaut there you go
18:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thanks
18:57 < Dune> I have some fairly high packet loss rates on some popular servers (very low ping though), so that might be the issue...
18:57 < Dune> especially since you can't reproduce
18:57 < Dune> first load is always much worse though
18:59 < Oy> hm, that's odd. as there should be requests in order. have to investigate when i have more time
18:59 < Dune> we tried a lot of things already, and I heard no one else complain about this
18:59 < Oy> there was someone else right?
18:59 < Oy> who created the issue
19:00 < Dune> so it could be my connection being somehow shitty. I'm moving to the countryside to escape the pandemy, let's see if that changes something :)
19:00 < Dune> Oh, I don't remember that
19:00 < Oy> ah i see u opened it, but quoted others who have it https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2285
19:01 < Dune> ah, I completely forgot
19:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I have a unreal high ping on startup like 300ms and after a refresh the browser shows the correct pings.
19:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> an
19:02 < Dune> that's true, ping is also affected
19:03 < Oy> higher pings could be caused by the initialization, shouldn't lead to losses though
19:04 < Dune> could pin https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2486, with github defaults it'll get buried fast
19:04 < Dune> or make a pr with that branch
19:05 < Oy> done
19:05 < Dune> do you know anything about this, Oy? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/54cf6d11315dea13bb40611c8e22eaf14b2cf1ac/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L1975
19:05 < Dune> we were talking with @ChillerDragon
19:05 < Dune> I see no reason to force cl_editor at 0
19:06 < Dune> surely this is an artifact from before we had the CFGFLAG_SAVE stuff to prevent variables from being writte in settings.cfg?
19:06 < Dune> @ChillerDragon likes to have a shortcut to "./teeworlds cl_editor 1" and this breaks it
19:08 < Oy> very old. probably sth broke in the past. cause lots of initialization had been done within the "normal" client on first render
19:08 < Dune> ah
19:08 < Oy> when everything works smoothly it could be removed
19:09 < Dune> well editor2 branch forces it to 1 and it seems to go fine
19:10 < Oy> any other issue that need to be pinned? while on it
19:10 < Dune> not afaik
19:38 < Learath2> I finally remembered why I wanted to write a hashmap, I wanted to implement #2224, and the best way to implement that is to use a hashmap to handle caching the images
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :0
19:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> reminds me of the factory design pattern.
20:22 < Dune> hm
20:22 < Dune> #2496: we already have a note under whispers to explain how to change chat recipient
20:24 < Dune> I guess we could add something short there. Press Tab to cycle between chat recipients. [...]
20:24 < Dune> Whispers may be logged by the server?
20:25 < Dune> Server admins may log whispers?
20:25 < Dune> Whisper privacy may be compromised by server modifications?
20:25 < Oy> Whispers aren't private and might be logged by the server?
20:26 < Dune> aren't secured*?
20:26 < Oy> yeah
20:26 < Dune> or secure
20:26 < Dune> or encrypted
20:26 < Oy> encrypted +1
20:26 < Dune> :)
20:28 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2497
20:28 < Dune> about this, we have a "friends-only" chat option
20:28 < Dune> this should probably only accept whispers from friends too
20:28 < Dune> that would solve 2497?
20:29 < Oy> hm, i personally would disable whispers in general
20:30 < Dune> so there would be a use case between "friends-only" and "all chat"
20:30 < Dune> things getting packed in the settings, it would be nice to have a discrete scrollbarOption that has a label associated
20:33 < Oy> like checkboxes?
20:33 < Dune> hold on, I screenshot something
20:37 < Dune> http://puu.sh/FkVA6/31a156119d.png
20:38 < Dune> make a DoScrollbarOptionList or LabeledOption or something
20:38 < Dune> that shows a label instead of a number?
20:39 < Dune> or probably handle that outside of the doscrollbaroption function
20:39 < Dune> could help with https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2293
20:40 < Dune> e.g @chillerdragon wants to hide server messages as well...
20:40 < Oy> ah yeah, that could be useful
20:40 < Oy> shouldn't be hard to do
20:41 < Dune> still hard to design something that would cover everyone's use case 
20:41 < Oy> yeah
20:41 < Dune> and not be a "select 10 boxes for each imaginable scenario of chat"
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> About the whisper discussion: My server crashed today, so I went to check the logs. It was an assert, errornous client id. I checked the core dump and this happened because someone wrote a whisper message to a person, that left the server exactly 1 second before.
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Now I would sit here like an idiot thinking why it should crash if that commit was in my mod already. I am AGAINST removing the logs, but we should indeed censor it, Maybe something like only the client ids, who sent a msg to who?
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> run your server in gdb
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it has no overhead
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut or create coredumps, then you can check it after the fact
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> `ulimit -c unlimited`
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Can anyone explain why the whisper msg even came through?
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> It doesnt make sense
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if i select person A in whisper, that guy leaves, my selected person is gone too
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> even if, shouldnt the server check too before trying to send to the receipiant?
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> even if, shouldnt the server check too before trying to send to the recipient?
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (edit in bridge is bad, as the whole messages is resent :D)
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> message*
21:20 < Oy> Dune: sth like that?
21:21 < Dune> Oy: oh, cleaner than I thought
21:21 < Dune> can't do out of bounds check though
21:24 < Dune> Oy: it behaves really poorly if you drag and drop around 0.5
21:25 < Dune> variable label width should not be possible
21:25 < Dune> oh, wrong branch, sorry
21:26 < Dune> - scrollbar width is messed up
21:26 < Dune> - background has double the alpha it should have
21:27 < Dune> maybe we should keep this tiny scroller and remove the rounding: https://puu.sh/FkWJq/fc8edf0697.png
21:28 < Dune> or make it a circle
21:31 < Oy> yeah, smaller one probably looks better
22:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://youtu.be/mL9khZWcrS8
22:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> That’s odd isn’t it?
23:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon missed unhook input I think
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> w
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i suggest stop using bots :P
