13:05 < SNAK3> hi !
13:05 <@matricks> HI!!!
13:05 < SNAK3> wow enthausiastc :P 
13:06 < SNAK3> sup?
13:06 <@matricks> work
14:52 < SNAK3> hi !
14:52 <@matricks> HI!!!
14:52 < SNAK3> are there any more powerups than the ninja thing ? 
14:52 <@matricks> nope
14:52 < SNAK3> hm allright 
14:52 <@matricks> there were supposed to be
14:53 < SNAK3> im curious then why is it called sv_powerups 
14:53 < SNAK3> ah ok 
14:53 < SNAK3> :) 
14:53 <@matricks> long time ago
14:53 <@matricks> in a coder head far far away
14:53 < SNAK3> why didn't they continue ?
14:53 < SNAK3> :P
14:54 < SNAK3> seems like a pretty neat idea 
14:54 <@matricks> dunno, other stuff got done, didn't have a really good idea for new powerups
14:54 <@matricks> the ninja still needed more work as well
14:54 < o_be_one> ninja is funny :)
14:54 < o_be_one> with the xxl mode thats awesome :D
14:55 < SNAK3> ninja is funny but a pain in the ass to play :P 
14:55 < SNAK3> well idk you could implement some sort of time based shield for example 
14:55 < SNAK3> aura like 
14:55 < SNAK3> or like in the infectio mod a highjump powerup 
14:56 < SNAK3> maybe a running powerup (faster movment) 
14:56 <@matricks> naa
14:56 <@matricks> I wanted the powerups to be more non-standard
14:56 <@matricks> perhaps a rambo / terminator power up
14:56 < SNAK3> sush as ?
14:57 < SNAK3> what would those do ?
14:57 <@matricks> minigun ? :)
14:57  * SNAK3 is going to pee 
14:57 < SNAK3> would be nice to 
14:57 < SNAK3> but that's more a weapon 
14:57 <@matricks> so is the ninja
14:58 <@matricks> the thought was that with the powerup, you become someone more or less
14:59 <@matricks> but hard to figure out something fun with it
15:02 < SNAK3> ?
15:02 < SNAK3> I don't get your last 2 messages 
15:02 < SNAK3> back btw :P 
15:03 <@matricks> the powers ups should transform you like the ninja does, but it's hard coming up with something fun
15:03 <@matricks> and I kinda looked into movies and take action heroes and do them as power ups
15:03 <@matricks> like the ninja
15:06 < SNAK3> well i think fast running powerup for example would fit into that catagory 
15:07 <@matricks> erh.. so.. a forrest gump powerup?
15:07 < SNAK3> yeah ;D 
15:07 < SNAK3> papapaaaam 
16:07 < o_be_one> rambo mode <3 nice idea matricks :D
