00:54 < ghost91> just*
00:56 < dhkmt> maybe your data folder is missing?
00:58 < ghost91> it's not
00:58 < ghost91> it get's created automatically by compiling after all
00:58 < dhkmt> no
00:58 < dhkmt> shouldn't
01:00 < ghost91> ah, ok, ty
01:00 < ghost91> needed to run "bam content"
01:01 < dhkmt> oh ok, nice to know
01:03 < ghost91> dhkmt: what was it you needed?
01:03 < dhkmt> i want to understand the teeworlds ui/rect system
01:03 < dhkmt> because i dont really understand it
01:03 < dhkmt> to use it efficieny
01:06 < ghost91> hmm, I don't really know much about it, so I guess I can't help you there :(
01:09 < dhkmt> i expected that.. thank you anyway :)
16:33 < ghost91> hey guys, what's up?
16:39 < BotoX> just waiting for cheap electronics from china
16:39 < BotoX> as always :3
16:42 < Sadale> BotoX, electronic parts or consumer electronic products?
16:42 < BotoX> oh hmm
16:42 < BotoX> both kinda
16:43 < BotoX> mostly assembled parts though
16:43 < BotoX> What I'm eagerly waiting on right now is this: http://www.gearbest.com/headlights/pp_203534.html
16:44 < BotoX> Bought it when it was on sale for $30 and two Xiaomi Powerbanks with three Sanyo/Panasonic ncr18650bf LiIon cells
16:44 < BotoX> ripped the powerbank appart for the cells since it's cheaper to buy the powerbank than the cells individually
16:45 < BotoX> They also come prewelded in parallel which makes it easier to make a pack myself :3
16:49 < Sadale> intersting.
16:50 < Sadale> BotoX, I guess I have seen you in teeworlds. are you an old player?
16:50 < BotoX> too old, I don't really play anymore though
16:50 < Sadale> lol
16:50 < Sadale> BotoX, I guess I have seen you in some city maps. Hopefully I remember correctly
16:51 < BotoX> oh wow that was _really_ long ago
16:51 < Sadale> BotoX, mikcity? lasercity? :p
16:51 < BotoX> like 6-7 years ago
16:51 < Sadale> yep. I think that's 5 years ago only :/
16:51 < BotoX> I played on the first "city" mod made by W@rmup
16:52 < BotoX> something like that was his name, the guy that made a few crash exploits for teeworlds lol
16:52 < Sadale> oh :(
16:52 < Sadale> BotoX, did you played [N]Race cities? :p
16:52 < BotoX> yeah
16:52 < BotoX> I remember that
16:53 < Sadale> I guess I started with mini tee life or mini tee city. I can't remember exctly
16:53 < Sadale> s/exctly/exactly/
16:53 < BotoX> I think I only played city because of interesting people, and that got me into modding teeworlds at the time
16:53 < BotoX> played instagib a lot afterwards in a clan (Shadow Warriors - SW)
16:54 < Sadale> BotoX, I also made a city mod(incomplete) back then :)
16:54 < Sadale> oh. instagib doesn't work here. I'm asian. and most servers are in europe/USA. so the ping is high everywhere for me
16:54 < BotoX> oh cool
16:54 < BotoX> an asian guy that speak fluent english!
16:55 < BotoX> Singapore maybe?
16:55 < Sadale> BotoX, hong kong, china
16:55 < BotoX> wow
16:55 < BotoX> did you move there or were you born in china?
16:56 < Sadale> BotoX, I was born here.
16:57 < BotoX> May I ask how old you are? Because most people from china that I know only know very basic english :v
16:57 < BotoX> and I fucked up that sentence
16:58 < Sadale> BotoX, 20
16:58 < Sadale> BotoX, Maybe they are younger. IDK.
16:58 < BotoX> Oh cool, I'm 19, live in Austria. Nice to meet you :p
16:58 < BotoX> Nah they are about the same age mostly
16:59 < BotoX> I guess you're learning (proper) english at school there?
16:59 < BotoX> Because when I was in Japan pretty much nobody was able to speak properly
17:00 < BotoX> asking a guy for directions (showed him the address in japanese since no offline google maps there :( )
17:00 < BotoX> he was struggling with left and right :D
17:00 < Sadale> BotoX, we are taught English at school here.
17:00 < Sadale> BotoX, oh lol
17:00 < Sadale> BotoX, Just draw arrows <-- -->
17:01 < BotoX> yeah he showed us with his arms and remembered it after a few seconds ^^
17:01 < BotoX> But yeah either they don't teach it properly or they simply don't care
17:01 < Sadale> BotoX, In case you didn't know, hong kong is somewhat different from the rest of china at the moment. :p
17:02 < BotoX> A friend of mine was there because of some business, he told me that most people there speak very fluently
17:02 < Sadale> BotoX, where? HK or japan?
17:02 < BotoX> I guess it's a more globalized region there because of international business, HK.
17:02 < Sadale> BotoX, well, not really :/
17:03 < BotoX> Have you ever been outside of china?
17:03 < Sadale> BotoX, they speak fluently because they can't be a businessman for meeting foreigner if they can't speak well :p
17:03 < BotoX> I hear that not many people leave the country
17:03 < BotoX> yeah that's true ^^
17:03 < Sadale> BotoX, and guess what? I can't speak English well :p
17:04 < BotoX> Oh you seem to be writing it very well though
17:04 < Sadale> BotoX, I have been outside China for a few times.
17:04 < BotoX> nice, where have you been to?
17:04 < Sadale> BotoX, Of course. English is my main language that I use in the internet. Not everyone do so here.
17:04 < Sadale> BotoX, indonesia and canada.
17:05 < BotoX> Yeah that's a common problem with big languages imo.
17:05 < BotoX> german, russian, french, chinese, japanese
17:05 < BotoX> they all have their own big communities so they don't feel the need to learn another language
17:05 < Sadale> I think that English is bloat :p
17:06 < BotoX> I like it more than german :v
17:06 < Sadale> ah :p
17:06 < BotoX> I also speak croatian since that's where my parents are from
17:06 < Sadale> BotoX, i speak cantonese just like most people here :)
17:07 < BotoX> Seems reasonable :p
17:07 < Sadale> BotoX, some people are pretty good in mandarin or english or both. But I'm not very good at them :(
17:07 < BotoX> I improved my english skills with voice chat in games or VoIP with natives
17:08 < Sadale> :o
17:08 < Sadale> Where did you find them? :o
17:08 < BotoX> on the internet hehe
17:08 < BotoX> most of them on counter strike
17:08 < Sadale> By meeting new friends in teeworlds :p
17:08 < BotoX> some from IRC
17:08 < Sadale> oh.
17:08 < BotoX> that I talk regularly too
17:09 < Sadale> I've never played CS :p
17:09 < BotoX> There's big chinese and korean servers for the mod I play
17:09 < BotoX> I sometimes join but it's very hard to play on there due to 400ms+ ping
17:10 < BotoX> Does anyone here need a free "cloud server" for 3 months, minus? https://helion.myloc.de/
17:10 < BotoX> code: HP-HELION-BETA-SPECIAL
17:11 < BotoX> https://i.botox.bz/1439128712.png I haven't setup an instance yet, but there's plenty of resources you get
17:12 < Sadale> BotoX, that's pretty powerful :o
17:12 < Sadale> I don't need it, tho :p
17:12 <@minus> BotoX: if i had any use for it
17:12 < BotoX> I have no idea what to do with it to be honest
17:13 < BotoX> Maybe try making a fully redundant server setup
17:13 < BotoX> with glusterfs etc.
17:13 < Sadale> maybe start a bitcoin miner there that you could never mine a block
17:13 < BotoX> hahaaha
17:13 < Sadale> think in this way: if you mine bitcoin there, it's like playing lottery with your setup time :p
17:14 < Sadale> with your setup time as a bet
23:35 < BotoX> http://cute.loli.website/webm/ayy_lmao/1422867578679-0.webm
23:35 < BotoX> safe for work, don't worry ^
23:35 < Savander> :C
23:38 < heinrich5991> BotoX: what's this?
23:38 <@matricks> thats RMS
23:39 < LittleWhite> :D
23:39 < LittleWhite> Make me smile :D
23:40 < BotoX> wow heinrich5991 
23:40 < BotoX> you don't know richard stallman :v
23:40 < heinrich5991> I do
23:40  * matricks codes a little bit more rust
23:40 < BotoX> The Saint iGNUcious
23:40 < heinrich5991> great!
23:41 < heinrich5991> BotoX: but even knowing RMS does not make me get the joke (is there any?)
23:41 < heinrich5991> is it the pony?
23:41 < BotoX> are your speakers turned on
23:41 < heinrich5991> no
23:41 < BotoX> maybe
23:41 < BotoX> just maybe
23:41 < BotoX> that video contains sound
23:41 < BotoX> since
23:41 < BotoX> it is a video
23:41 < BotoX> with sound
23:41 < LittleWhite> it is pictures, with sound :D
23:42 < heinrich5991> BotoX: you're right, it has sound :P
