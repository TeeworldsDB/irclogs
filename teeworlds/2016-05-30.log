18:41 < edible> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=server_setup  -> [Server Settings](/?page=docs&wiki=server_settings) <- this should be a link no?
19:57 <@heinrich5991> edible: yes
19:57 <@heinrich5991> minus: ^, looks like a ``` is missing after the code block
19:58  * minus checks github
20:03 <@minus> >Error processing changes.
20:03 <@minus> gg buildbot
20:16 <@minus> okay, we're good
20:16 <@minus> thanks, edible
20:18 < edible> :)
22:40 < edible> when you change_map, does it change to the first match it finds?
22:41 < edible> does it go by alphabetical order?
22:41 <@heinrich5991> no, it must be an exact match
22:41 < edible> mmm weird
22:41 <@heinrich5991> change_map abc only matches abc.map
22:42 < edible> but i have about 4 maps with the same name but different crc's
22:42 < edible> so by which crc will it go with?
22:43 < edible> it does change, dont know which one it goes to though
22:44 <@heinrich5991> if the names are abc_12345678.map, etc., none of these will match
22:50 < edible> does it matter if its add_vote?
22:50 < edible> with a change_map?
22:50 <@heinrich5991> no
22:51 <@heinrich5991> check the ~/.teeworlds/maps folder
22:51 < edible> i am
22:51 < edible> so you're saying it should fail?
22:51 <@heinrich5991> if no abc.map exists, yes
22:51 < edible> abc.map does exist, but theres multiple ones with different crc's
22:52 <@heinrich5991> how can multiple abc.map exist in the same folder?
22:52 < edible> and when i add_vote changemap it matches, one of them
22:52 < edible> it has different _crc's
22:54 <@heinrich5991> edible: in the file name?
22:59 < edible> yes... but maybe its a mod thing
23:00 <@heinrich5991> which mod?
23:05 < edible> ddnet
23:05 < edible> im setting up a ctf server, i do have multiple ctf maps as well with the same name
23:06 < deen> you have to rename one of those files to what you want them to be called, edible
23:10 <@heinrich5991> edible: I don't think ddnet has special code to load idfferent maps
23:10 <@heinrich5991> maybe you have it in the global folder?
23:12 < deen> heinrich5991: i assume he has downloaded multiple versions of a map in his downloadedmaps directory, with different crcs
23:12 <@heinrich5991> but apparantly the server can load a map
23:12 < deen> maybe loading one of the default maps, like ctf5
23:13 <@heinrich5991> yea, maybe
23:25 < edible> oh, you are correct, it seems to be loading maps/kobra 4.map which is... nowhere, because the maps directory is empty
23:26 < edible> i dont know what is happening
23:30 < deen> edible: Kobra 4 is a default map of DDNet client, it's distributed with the client
23:31 < edible> alright, thanks deen, sorry for the useless questions
23:34 < edible> would it be a bad idea to add 2000 add_vote's for map changes?
23:35 <@minus> i think there's a hard limit, isn't there?
23:35 <@minus> like 100 or so?
23:35 <@minus> also, who would scroll through that many
23:38 < edible> mm would be nice if there was a max column in the settings page
23:38 < edible> (i would prefer that than minimizing, opening explorer, and selecting from there
23:40 < edible> and by selecting, i mean, scrolling, checking, opening teeworlds, writing in console change_map and then having to memorize the _crc part which would be terrible... well its a mild inconvenience
