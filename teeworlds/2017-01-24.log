00:00 < necropotame> Yes :)
00:00 < necropotame> I'm centralizing most of mods (your including), make it so the base is that same for all, and then merge blranches on them
00:01 < necropotame> Then, I can propagate updates for one branch in all of them is needed
00:01 < necropotame> if needed*
00:08 < keep1> nice initiative
00:09 < keep1> can i keep other branches ?
00:10 < necropotame> You can do what you want. I've just copied your repository. I will remove all your branch to keep only "bInfMod" and rename it "master" (it's to help with scripts)
00:11 < necropotame> I will merge what you upload on your repository regularly.
00:13 < necropotame> I will not host it, btw, so don't worry ^^ It's just to see how I can refactor mods, and for the future, it will be helpful to have a common basis. And you can benefit of those branches, of course.
00:27 < keep1> okay
00:29 < keep1> oh you did it :D
00:29 < keep1> thanks ^^
01:03 < keep1> necropotame: well, good night cya later
02:59 < Learath2> necropotame: https://github.com/Speedy-Consoles/teeworlds the branches dd_fb_* all have different standalone features
02:59 < Learath2> i think they all still merge to master
02:59 < Learath2> mostly obsolete but thought you might be interested
08:46 < necropotame> Thanks, I will look into that :)
18:41 < Obani> necropotame, started working on a new inf map
18:41 < Obani> Not sure if I will finish it but the concept is interesting
18:44 < Obani> btw necropotame I should maybe some day do some adjustments of infection's texture pack which is pretty crappy graphically and technically (not symetric in each edges)
