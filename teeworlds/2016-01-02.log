05:22 < PochOut> heya i need a bit of help if there's anyone available
05:22 < PochOut> my game gets way too zoomed in so i cant play at all
05:23 < PochOut> how do i change the resolution? once ingame i cant even get to any kind of menu
05:23 < PochOut> cuz its too zoomed in
05:29 < PochOut> found a thread about it, will try that.
05:45 < PochOut> works to play in 800x600 not full screen, not optimal but beter than nothing iguess
21:31 < WolfAlex> what is Tex U / Tex V in the 0.7 mapeditor, quad point? ._.
21:32 <@minus> texture coordinates?
21:32 < Kirbs> why is it "U" and "V", though?
21:33 <@minus> texture coordinates usually use u and v instead of x and y
21:33 < WolfAlex> ah thx minus 
21:33 < Kirbs> ah, ok
