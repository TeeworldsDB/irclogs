14:54 < jxsl13> could someone compile a zcatch windows 64/86 binary for me? github.com/teelevision
17:57 < BotoX> const json_value &rStart = (*pJsonData); <- what is this in ansi C D:
17:58 <@matricks> BotoX: const json_value *pStart = pJsonData;
17:59 < BotoX> Doesn't seem to work, or probably the json-parser has to be used different with C
17:59 < BotoX> since there's no operator overloading
17:59 <@matricks> what are you trying todo?
17:59 <@matricks> (btw, there are no references in C)
17:59 < BotoX> yeah, I figured that out
18:00 < BotoX> Trying to add json (https://github.com/udp/json-parser) support to some legacy C code
18:00 < BotoX> inline const struct _json_value &operator [] (int index) const <- But I guess I won't be able to use this heh
18:00 <@matricks> no, thats c++
18:00 < BotoX> Yeah
18:01 <@matricks> it detects if c++ is available and exposes things like that
18:01 < BotoX> Yeah, I totally forgot that the library does that, was using it in a C++ project before
21:02 <@minus> ANSI C, yuck
21:26 < jxsl13> does anyone know how to set up uptee by sushitee on a windows machine? 
21:27 <@minus> install linux
21:27 < jxsl13> sadly not possible, for the next 3 months
21:27 < rayv> Boot from USB
21:27 < jxsl13> sadly not possible, for the next 3 months
21:27 < rayv> :(
21:27 <@minus> wait 3 months
21:28 < jxsl13> don't want to :D
21:28 < deen> try something crazy with cygwin?
21:28 < jxsl13> already doing
21:28 < jxsl13> getting an error
21:28 < deen> or setup a linux vm
21:28 < jxsl13> .. .
21:28 < deen> (never used uptee, no idea)
21:29 < jxsl13> trying to download all the cygwin plugins in order to get the error fixed, doubt it will work
21:30 < jxsl13> does anyone kow which of the cywgi servers has the highest upstream/downstream?
21:30 < jxsl13> know*
21:30 < jxsl13> cygwin*
21:33 < heinrich5991> isn't uptee written in python/django?
21:33 < jxsl13> yeah it is
21:34 < heinrich5991> mh. have you tried installing python and django?
21:35 < jxsl13> python is already installed, django not, but I fail doing the "make" of uWSGI
21:35 < jxsl13> get an error
21:36 < heinrich5991> are you following this? https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/howto/windows/
21:36 < jxsl13> I'm following the documentation of sushitee on github
21:37 < jxsl13> https://github.com/upTee/upTee/blob/master/docs/production_server.md
21:37 < jxsl13> gcc: Fehler: nicht erkannte Kommandozeilenoption »-rdynamic«

21:40 <@minus> -rdynamic might not be needed on windows
21:41 < jxsl13> how to exclude it ?
21:49 < jxsl13> uwsgiconfig.py <- inside there (http://projects.unbit.it/downloads/uwsgi-2.0.9.tar.gz) it's included, but I don't know how to remove it :)
