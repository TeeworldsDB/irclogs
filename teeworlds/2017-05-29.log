08:51 <@heinrich5991> minus: you could switch the http status code for every page except / to 503 Service Unavailable
09:00 <@minus> True
09:06 <@minus> done, heinrich5991; was harder than it seems
09:06 <@heinrich5991> oh lol
09:06 <@heinrich5991> just wanted to report that it doesn't work completely
09:06 <@heinrich5991> after refreshing it did :)
09:06 <@heinrich5991> WIP after all
09:06 <@heinrich5991> minus: why?
09:06 <@minus> return 503; error_page 503 /index.html; does not work and serves the nginx default 503 page
09:07 <@minus> need return 503; error_page 503 @maintenance; location @maintenance { rewrite ^(.*)$ /index.html break; }
09:07 <@heinrich5991> oh
09:08 <@heinrich5991> could be normal 200 for / (https://www.teeworlds.com/)
09:08 <@minus> still haven't heard anything new from kottizen :/
12:17 <+teetow> just host it on github pages instead =)
12:18 <@minus> ;)
12:18 <@minus> we have a forum, you know
12:19 <+teetow> screw that, just use twitter
12:19 <+teetow> *ducks*
12:41 <+koomi> discord!
13:38 <+matricks> next time I make a game or something like that, the homepage will not have any social features. let people sort that shit out themselfs
13:39 <+matricks> and I canbget some blissful ignorance
13:39 <+matricks> *can get
13:45 <+teetow> I'd actually suggest this: Get some usage metrics on the forum, see which parts of it can be safely pruned
13:46 <+teetow> track views and posts over a few weeks
13:46 <+teetow> I'd predict you'd have some static content that acts as a knowledge base -- transfer that to a wiki
13:46 <+teetow> then there's the announcements stuff, which is just really a blog
13:47 <+teetow> and finally the dreaded "community" part, which is players interacting in various ways. that's a discord server
13:48 <+teetow> only thing remaining is the modding community, and that should ideally be hosted on something like teeworldsmods.com and run by someone else
13:50 <+teetow> fwiw, this channel could also be on discord =)
14:07 <@minus> you just have to start a fire, don't you?
14:07 <@minus> with your discord comments
14:09 <@minus> update on the website/server: data recovery in progress, ETA for an update: 1-2 days
14:09 <@minus> but moving the main part of the site to static hosting is a good call
14:10 <@minus> would work even better if someone redid the website
14:10 <@minus> teetow: *wink*
14:30 <+teetow> hello
14:31 <+teetow> I am person what knows CSS
