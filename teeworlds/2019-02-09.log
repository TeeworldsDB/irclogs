16:37 < day>  the tee collisions in 0.7 definitely feel super awkward
16:38 < day> in 0.6 it was a bit unpredictable, but mostly tees wouldnt collide when delta v was large enough
16:38 < day> now you collide, always :|
16:39 < Oy> there shouldn't be any difference
16:39 <@Dune> didn't know anything changed
16:39 <@Dune> btw https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2018
16:39 <@Dune> what I was saying was that there is an issue with cmake expecting translations+maps to be there in order to compile (?)
16:40 <@Dune> but apparently this is being interpreted as "you need them to build teeworlds"
16:40 <@Dune> it's only a cmake thing
16:40 <@Dune> not sure what that "tarball" is exactly either
16:41 < Oy> teewwolrds src compressed in a folder
16:41 < Oy> should be able to compile without translations+map
16:41 <@Dune> can't they use a tarball with the submodules?
16:41 <@Dune> yeah
16:42 <@Dune> I'm not sure if that would solve the openbsd blocking problem though
16:42 <@Dune> they seem to have an issue with translations+maps not being in the tarball?
16:43 < Oy> cmake doesn't build then?
16:43 < Oy> like using https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/archive/master.zip
16:44 < Oy> or the src download on our website
16:44 <@Dune> ah, I see
16:44 < Oy> people don't always use git to get the source, especially beginners
16:45 <@Dune> right
16:45 <@Dune> I've never seen a project listing all the files to compile in the cmakefiles. there's gotta be another way?
16:45 < day> Oy: im 99% sure it's an extreme difference. another player confirmed it as well.
16:46 < day> initially i thought it's a ping thing, as i observed it on super low ping servers. but ive run into that behavior on every server independent of ping
16:51 < Oy> another way would be good :)
16:51 <@Dune> remember why it was done like that, @LordSk ?
16:52 < Oy> day: nothing i know of changed in that regard. maybe you used to play on modded 0.6 servers, which behaved differently?
16:54 < rand> it's it known as the good way to build project (adding file one by one)
16:54 < rand> I don't remember if it's for security reason or reproductibility 
16:56 < rand> and : We do not recommend using GLOB to collect a list of source files from your source tree. If no CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added or removed then the generated build system cannot know when to ask CMake to regenerate.
16:57 < rand> this one looks like the more relevant :]
16:58 < Oy> good that we have bam :)
17:01 <@Dune> bam handles that well though, why couldn't cmake :/
17:01 < rand> idea: use bam to produce the initial CMakeLists.txt :p
17:01 <@Dune> defeats the purpose :p
17:02 < rand> no
17:02 <@Dune> people then need to have bam installed
17:02 < rand> the cmakelists has to be coherent on the repo/tarball
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah basically what rand said for cmake
17:02 <@Dune> yes?
17:03 < rand> as long it is up to date, people don't have to run bam
17:03 <@Dune> ah, well true, but it's a bit weird, isn't it
17:03 < rand> it is :D
17:03 <@Dune> feels like collecting files from the source tree isn't such a big deal
17:03 < Oy> you need a different cmakelist for the teeworlds src and the one that has the submodules in place (translations, maps)
17:03 <@Dune> you just need to run cmake manually when there is a new file
17:03 < rand> could be a simple python script too
17:04 <@Dune> most academic tools I built seemed to use that :/
17:04 < rand> hm, I guess it is possible to use a CMakeLists.txt for a subproject
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Yeah I that too dune
17:05 <@Dune> adding files is rare enough that you can just rerun cmake right
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> +do
17:06 < rand> in fact, I don't understand, if I add a file and run cmake .., (with glob), is the file added or do I need to `touch CMakeLists.txt` ?
17:12 <@Dune> oh damn, there is a status.tw API now: https://status.tw/?p=apidoc
19:15 <@Dune> aaah
19:15 <@Dune> the second parameter of localize must be separated by a space, lol
19:26 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2018#issuecomment-462066607
19:26 <@Dune> so the problem is not just building
19:26 <@Dune> they expect to have translations & maps in the package
19:28 < rand> could it be possible to have different target in cmake ?
19:28 < Oy> space lol
19:29 < Oy> we could add a complete src download manually
19:29 < Oy> not possible to tell github that it should include submodules i think
19:34 <@Dune> so packagers are unhappy that they can't get the tarball to include in one-click? isn't that weird :/
19:34 <@Dune> or do they include a script that downloads it from teeworlds.com or github?
19:35 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2018#issuecomment-462066607 seems in that case they use https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/archive/0.7.2.tar.gz
19:40 <@Dune> So we should release differently
19:41 <@Dune> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34719785/how-to-add-submodule-files-to-a-github-release
19:41 <@Dune> "The Github support answered me :
19:41 <@Dune> This is not possible currently."
19:41 <@Dune> so you have to make it manually
19:44 < Oy> too bad that you can't even disable the automaically created src files by github within a release
19:47 <@Dune> :/
22:56 < TeeSlayer> It's not possible to create custom pickups, right? Neither changing the opacity of layers on the fly?
22:56 < TeeSlayer> (by custom pickups I mean custom graphics for them)
22:59 <@Dune> no
