18:36 <@Dune_> hello oy
18:37 <@Dune_> +xxx binds are not any special in the teeworlds code, correct? it is only a convention
18:37 < Oy> hey
18:37 < Oy> yeah
18:37 <@Dune_> not sure how to make a pretty fix then
18:38 <@Dune_> btw do you want to write up the news post or?
18:39 <@Dune_> not sure if there should be a list of 0.7->0.7.1 change somewhere - I guess not
18:40 < Oy> would just list all changes together - don't think the 0.7-> 0.7.1 separation is necessary
18:40 <@Dune_> aight
18:41 < Oy> about the news post - if u wanna do it go ahead :D
18:41 <@Dune_> alright
18:41 <@Dune_> not much left for a release, the most consequential is probably the input stack
18:42 < Oy> yeah
18:42 <@Dune_> masterservers don't need an update I guess
18:42 <@Dune_> nothing changed
18:42 < Oy> i can do it if u want
18:42 < Oy> yeah masters are cool
18:43 <@Dune_> if you have a bit of free time, go ahead :D
18:43 <@Dune_> translation stuff is over
18:43 < Oy> ok
18:46 <@Dune_> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1775 isn't closed?
18:49 < Oy> no when ur name is empty you can'T write chat messages
18:50 <@Dune_> ahh, ok
18:54 <@Dune_> looking into the serverbrowser overlapping
18:57 < Oy> already assigned it to me :P
18:58 <@Dune_> oh :P
18:58 <@Dune_> didn't see, sorry
18:58 <@Dune_> Oy: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/80843bcf272daec0de5e3dfa0bc030581a9fbc18/src/game/client/components/menus_browser.cpp#L1996
18:58 < Oy> :P
18:58 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fp9BU
18:58 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master ea6c695 oy: fixed chat messages for players with empty names. closes #1775
18:58 <@Dune_> I think this should be capped to 16
18:59 <@Dune_> e.g; i < max numclients, 16
18:59 < Oy> why?
18:59 <@Dune_> because there is no room to print 64?
18:59 < Oy> i think rand added a scrollbar
18:59 <@Dune_> oh, didn't test that
19:01 < rand> a very slim one
19:01 <@Dune_> welp, dbg_dummies too high crashes the server
19:01 < rand> dummies are not report as player
19:02 <@Dune_> ah, so no used testing
19:02 < rand> bots are :]
19:02 <@Dune_> I see :p
19:06 < rand> Dune_: i configured the server so you can test it
19:06 <@Dune_> thank you rand
19:07 <@Dune_> you didn't lie when you said it's slim :D
19:08 < Dune_linux> https://imgur.com/T0Aek7d
19:08 < Dune_linux> rand: strange colors
19:09 < rand> indeed
19:10 < rand> i don't see it with my obsolete client
19:10 < rand> oh
19:10 < rand> ok, when using the search
19:11 < rand> if you are patient, I will look in the middle of the week
19:12 < rand> I will keep the bot server as it is
19:12 <@Dune_> thanks
19:12 <@Dune_> I can look into it once I'm done writing up stuff, maybe it'll be a quick fix
19:12 < rand> I have a big appointment tomorrow :3
19:12 < rand> feel free to fix it :D
19:13 <@Dune_> good luck for your "appointment", and tell us if she's cute :D
19:22 <@Dune_> the 0.6.1 changelog was nice: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=8217
19:24 < Oy> yeah
19:25 < Oy> but now you have lots of changes that are done with a couple of commits - would have to add a commitlist
19:26 <@Dune_> welp
19:27 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fp9BM
19:27 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master a05e40f oy: fixed clipping in the server browser. closes #1818
19:42 <@Dune_> working on the writeup with Lordsk
19:44 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fp9Rn
19:44 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master c4fbceb oy: fixed stuck input. closes #1761
19:45 < Oy> great :)
19:45 <@Dune_> oh, that's quite short :)
19:45 < Oy> yeah
19:51 < Oy> we should add a settings button to the server browser for 0.7.2
19:56 < Oy> closed the 0.7.1 milestone
19:56 <@Dune_> \o/
20:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> \o/
20:48 <@Dune_> we need someone to take care of steam
21:10 < Oy> heinrich5991: is the only one with access i think
21:11 <@Dune_> you don't have it?
21:11 < minus> bus factor: 1
21:16 < Oy> no
21:34 <@Dune_> I'm not sure what to do with @Sonix's work. Either make it a maps topic (but then it kinda loses its official character), or make it a dev blog post, but then screenshots must be moved to the comments or something
21:38 < Oy> what about the changlist? dev blog post? the map stuff should be the next post then?
21:38 <@Dune_> yes
21:39 <@Dune_> it will work because sonix's topic is old
21:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix could we split your post in two, with the screenshots?
21:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if you're busy, just make a blank reply and I'll move them
21:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> (to the comments)
21:42 < Oy> is it possible to move sonix' post to another thread?
21:42 <@Dune_> it is in a thread of its own? you mean as a comment? that is possible
21:42 <@Dune_> (hold on making sure)
21:43 < Oy> yeah make it a comment in another thread
21:43 <@Dune_> strangely enough I don't have the same rights as on the regular forums
21:43 <@Dune_> but we can always ask sonix to c/c I guess
21:43 <@Dune_> wouldn't want maps to lose on visibility
21:45 <@Dune_> if you remove the screenshots it's not that big
21:50 <@Dune_> so I guess we need heinrich5991for the release. I pinged him on github
22:10 <@Dune_> TIL remodeled takes two l in british english
22:24 < Oy> should probably replace the z's with s's as well
22:24 <@Dune_> i replaced optimization and customizable
22:24 <@Dune_> not sure if anything remains
22:24 <@Dune_> the tool I used suggested cheque instead of check but I don't think that's right :D
22:25 < Oy> :D
22:32 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fp92l
22:32 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 899f9f0 oy: updated languages submodule
22:32  * Dune_ checks
23:06 < Oy> made a draft for the 0.7.1 release on github
23:07 <@Dune_> ah, nice
23:07 <@Dune_> I'm getting done with the changelog
23:08 <@Dune_> do we wait for steam?
23:09 < Oy> dunno
23:10 < Oy> no idea when heinrich will be back
23:10 <@Dune_> yeah
23:10 <@Dune_> guess we can at least wait for one day
23:10 <@Dune_> he's usually responsive on git
23:10 < Oy> and he probably needs time to make the steam release - no idea how that works, but i think you can't just upload our release there ;)
23:11 <@Dune_> oh, really
23:11 <@Dune_> no idea about those things
23:12 <@Dune_> we'll just need minus to make the downloads + version server and then it's all good for tomorrow as far as I'm concerned :)
23:13 < minus> heinrich5991 can do the downloads too btw
23:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah, @Zatline might need a bit of time to make some neat illustrations
23:14 <@Dune_> minus: it's been a while he hasn't popped though
23:17 < Oy> my steam teeworlds installation doesn't look that different from the standard one - so maybe it's not that complex - dunno
23:18 < Oy> dunno if some steam stuff needs to be compiled into the steam binary
23:18 <@Dune_> I see
