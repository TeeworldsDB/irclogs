14:18 < minus> slopes could really change the gameplay; i'm curious how that would work out
14:43 <@Dune> some people did slopes and it didn't turn out too well :|
15:06 < minus> i can see why that'd be the case; you don't have much ground contact in teeworlds if you play well, so slopes probably don't bring anything helpful  to the table
15:09 <@Dune> I heard something like that yeah
15:09 <@Dune> didn't play it myself
15:09 <@Dune> @magnet @LordSk
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <magnet> Yup they're useless.
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <magnet> No one really stay grounded long
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> They seem useless for sliding down yeah
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> but they could smooth out corners
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Make for interesting laser bounce angles
15:13 <@Dune> maybe a bit of variety and fun in maps too, even if it's not viable for good ctf players :) i don't know
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ^ that too, probably the most important use of them to be honest
15:22 <@heinrich5991> minus: the version server says 0.7.1 is out but 0.7.2 is already out
15:23 <@Dune> best not to update
15:23 <@Dune> people would think there is suddenly a new version, try it out, see nothing changed
15:23 <@Dune> wait for the next :)
15:24 <@heinrich5991> it's just confusing, when opening a 0.6.x client
15:24 <@heinrich5991> we should probably have an array of allowed "newest versions", like e.g. the tor network has
15:31 <@Dune> I dont see the problem
15:32 <@heinrich5991> I open 0.6.5, I see "0.7.1 is out, go download it at teeworlds.com"
15:32 <@heinrich5991> I go to teeworlds.com and it says "download 0.7.2"
15:33 <@Dune> okay, but that doesn't sound as bad to me as broadcasting to everyone a new version that happened months ago and will disappoint them. just wait a bit and there'll be 0.7.3
15:36 <@heinrich5991> yes, hence the proposed solution: [15:24:31] <@heinrich5991> we should probably have an array of allowed "newest versions", like e.g. the tor network has
15:37 <@heinrich5991> then we put 0.7.2 and 0.7.3 in there (we obviously can't for these versions anymore because they're out already), and 0.7.2 doesn't get a message but everyone not on these versions gets "0.7.3 is out!"
15:39 <@Dune> I don't understand why 0.7.2 shouldn't get a message when 0.7.3 is out?
15:39 <@heinrich5991> eh. *put 0.7.1 and 0.7.2 in there
15:42 <@heinrich5991> (to make the version server say exactly the thing you want to say: if you're on 0.7.1, that's fine, 0.7.2 is fine, too)
15:46 <@Dune> ah, I see your point
15:53 < minus> heinrich5991: not anymore
15:53 < minus> does 0.7 have a versionsrv?
16:12 <@heinrich5991> I don't know
