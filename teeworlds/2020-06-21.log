14:56 < zatiranyk> Hey! 
14:57 < zatiranyk> I can't play on any DDRacenetwork server, all I can do is /kill xD someone know why? :(
14:57 < zatiranyk> i only have 1 client...
14:59 < zatiranyk> running on TW 0.6.4
15:02 < Dune> ChillerDragon: ^
15:56 < ChillerDragon> zatiranyk: wdym by "can't play" ? What is not working and why do you still use 0.6 :/
15:57 < ChillerDragon> btw there is also #ddnet irc
15:57 < zatiranyk> oh ty! The problem has solved by itself xD 0.6 because Ubuntu, but there will be an update soon ^^
15:57 < ChillerDragon> even debian has 0.7 in the repo already
15:58 < zatiranyk> yep
15:58 < zatiranyk> i know right ^^
16:00 < zatiranyk> I couldnt play because when i join, i'm stuck in the scoreboard, even if i "joined the game". My tee seems to be alive but i can't control it
16:00 < zatiranyk> And i can even kill it with /kill
16:02 < zatiranyk> Do u think I should make a post of it in forum thought? since its kind of an old version
16:02 < zatiranyk> ChillerDragon, 
16:04 < zatiranyk> So the problem seems to fix by itself (maybe server-side?) after like 30min.
16:26 < zatiranyk> Ok, not fixed xDDD some DDNet works, some dont...
16:26 < zatiranyk> seems regular are fine tho
16:26 < zatiranyk> (no DDNet
16:55 < Dune> looks like a server-side problem
