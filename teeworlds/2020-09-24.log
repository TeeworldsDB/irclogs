03:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> minus: teeworlds.com is currently down
08:19 < minus> looks like kottizen's network died
12:02 < ChillerDragon> oof!
12:03 < ChillerDragon> can we redirect the domain to some backup page ? minus
12:04 < ChillerDragon> Like a fanhosted downtime page or github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds to not be completley down for a unknown time
12:44 <@Dune> Not sure that's much better
12:56 <@Dune> Its back
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> send love to Kottizen
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> pls
15:45 < ChillerDragon> Ok so is it a feature or a bug that you can not slap a compose bind on a +keyword bind?
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> this specific combination caused a lot of trouble
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I'm not sure if it's *supposed* to work now
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I'm not sure how it would work if it did ðŸ˜„
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's the trouble
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> shift+x --> when you release shift, release?
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> also conflicts with x binds etc
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> very annoying to handle
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It's rather easy to say that it should work, but it's rather hard to define how compound binds are supposed to behave like
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ^
15:49 < ChillerDragon> works just fine in ddnet
15:49 < ChillerDragon> zooming on shift scroll and chaning weapons on normal scroll is so convienient
15:50 < ChillerDragon> well i assume when i bind shift+key that the bind gets triggered when i press shift+key but nothing happens when key is bound to a +keyword
15:52 < ChillerDragon> ``eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIwMjY4MTFiYjZiZjU0YjU1ODdjMmQ4OGY1NGExMjcyMiIsInlnZ3QiOiIxZDYyNzM5N2VmZjI0NGE0YWU3OTg0N2NhMzgzMTI3ZCIsInNwciI6IjVmZjY4YzMxNWFmNTQ1YjI4YjQ5YTBjYzI0OGNlMWU4IiwiaXNzIjoiWWdnZHJhc2lsLUF1dGgiLCJleHAiOjE2MDExMjcwNzAsImlhdCI6MTYwMDk1NDI3MH0.otHrXEm6oDn3CP17x4kEkiLuHehxJ2dphNDIQBtsfSg
15:53 < ChillerDragon> woops leaked my minecraft token lmao
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nice
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> saved
15:53 < ChillerDragon> regenerated
15:53 < ChillerDragon> :p
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> also saved
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :0
15:54 < ChillerDragon> ``bind x foo;bind shift+x bar`` works fine. x->no such command foo shift+x -> no such command bar. But ``bind x +foo;bind shift+x bar`` x->no such command foo and shift+x -> nothing happens
15:56 < ChillerDragon> hm i guess ill just downgrade to ddnet
16:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It works in ddnet, though I have no idea how I implemented it
16:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> So, that says how well defined it's behaviour is
19:39 < MalwareTele> HI
19:39 < MalwareTele> sorry for caps
19:39 < MalwareTele> Hi
19:43 <@Dune> aand he's gone

19:52 <@Dune> well hi MalwareTele
19:52 <@Dune> we've been expecting you
19:59 < MalwareTele> why
20:06 < MalwareTele> what is the diffrence between ddnet and teeworlds
20:07 < ChillerDragon> well teeworlds is the base game a simple pvp game and ddnet is a mod that focuses on ddrace 
20:07 < ChillerDragon> so its mostly a server mod that is still compatible with vanilla clients but also ships a own client for better expirience
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> ddnet also provides services like ddnet official servers and ranking stuff, in addition to just being a mod.
20:08 < ChillerDragon> yea ddnet is actually a big communiyt with tons of official stuff ye
