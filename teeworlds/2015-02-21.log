09:07 < MoOoRice> what if I don't care about locking my username with a password ?
09:08 <@matricks> huh?
09:08 < MoOoRice> I'm sorry I'm not really used to IRC. Do I have to register ?
09:08 <@matricks> no
09:09 < MoOoRice> the only risk is that someone uses my username, right ?
09:09 <@matricks> yah
09:10 <@matricks> and noone really cares
09:10 <@matricks> and btw, your nick doesn't get reserved eitherway so
09:10 < MoOoRice> I think so :)
09:10 < MoOoRice> ah xD
09:10 <@matricks> you can verify someone identity with a /whois
09:10 <@matricks> and the registration is used to control channels etc
09:52 <@minus> morning
09:52 <@matricks> MORNING!
09:53 < rayv> hello
09:53 <@matricks> o/
09:53 < LittleWhite> matricks: \Â o /
09:53 < LittleWhite> minus: rayv: Morning guys :)
09:53 < rayv> o/
11:36 < MoOoRice> how do you set m_Debug variable to true ? I want to enable more output ^^
11:38 < heinrich5991> you could put m_Debug = true somewhere
11:39 < MoOoRice> lol
11:39 <@matricks> m_Debug... which one? :)
11:40 < MoOoRice> if(g_Config.m_Debug)
11:40 < MoOoRice> there is this at several places in the source
11:42 <@matricks> debug=1
11:42 <@matricks> I guess
11:42 < MoOoRice> in the source ?
11:42 < MoOoRice> not in the server config ?
11:42 <@matricks> "debug 1" on the config, console or commandline
11:46 < MoOoRice> huum ok that's not in the reference ^^
11:46 < MoOoRice> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=server_settings
11:47 <@matricks> because it's for coders, not for server admins etc
11:47 <@matricks> enabling it will produce a big fat warning for the clients
11:48 < MoOoRice> huum right ^^
11:49 <@matricks> think the debug variable actually changes some gameplay elements
11:49 < MoOoRice> really ?
11:49 < MoOoRice> :O
11:49 <@matricks> yah
11:50 <@matricks> well, looks like it doesn't
11:51 <@matricks> only stress does that
11:54 < MoOoRice> stress ?
11:54 < MoOoRice> to test performances ?
11:54 <@matricks> to find bugs
11:55 <@matricks> test stability etc
11:55 <@matricks> it's done for soak-testing
12:14 < MoOoRice> is there any network protocol documentation ?
12:14 <@matricks> NO!
12:14 <@matricks> :)
12:15 < MoOoRice> let me guess, you already answered this question 95616 times ? x)
12:15 <@matricks> no.. 83478 only
12:15 < MoOoRice> xD
12:15 <@matricks> oh well.. 83479 now
12:16 < MoOoRice> xDD
12:16 <@matricks> protocol in it self is kinda simple
12:16 <@matricks> the important part is to know how the syncronization of the game snapshot is made
12:17 <@matricks> http://trac.bookofhook.com/bookofhook/trac.cgi/wiki/Quake3Networking
12:17 <@matricks> reading that gives a pretty good idea
12:17 <@minus> Black magic?
12:17 <@matricks> minus: purple actually
12:17 <@minus> I see
12:21 < MoOoRice> huum okay thanks
12:22 <@matricks> and I did some stuff to the snapshot to keep stuff simple
12:22 <@matricks> the snapshot only contains 32bit integers
12:23 < LittleWhite> I did not read yet the document, but I think it's a bit similar to what it is done in braid
12:23 < LittleWhite> Braid is a game with return to the past feature
12:23 <@matricks> I know, played through it

12:23 <@matricks> that game has some other issues to deal with however
12:23 < LittleWhite> of course :)
12:24 < LittleWhite> but he is using snapshot of the game + compression since he has strict memory limitation
12:24 <@matricks> yeah, I kinda figured that out
12:25 <@matricks> I wondered a bit if it was deterministic so he didn't even have todo the snapshots
12:25 < LittleWhite> for particles, it is
12:26 < LittleWhite> but otherwise, it's just optimized snapshot (like not saving values that does not change)
12:26 <@matricks> same stuff that quake does
12:26 <@matricks> and teeworlds
12:26 <@matricks> delta compression
12:26 < LittleWhite> :)
12:26 < LittleWhite> exactly :)
12:27 <@matricks> snapshot -> delta compression -> int packing -> huffman.. thats the stack in teeworlds more or less
12:30 <@matricks> the demo-files are like that
12:59  * minus np: DRAX, Laxity [MON], Mick Rippon, WAVE, Maniacs of Noise - Firing UP
12:59 <@minus> do you know that tune, matricks?
12:59 <@matricks> nope
12:59 <@minus> D:
13:00 <@minus> it's 23 minutes of awesomeness
13:00 <@minus> which you can easily tell be all the artists
13:00 <@minus> http://music.mnus.de/scene/Maniacs%20of%20Noise/Maniacs_of_Noise_-_Firing_Up.flac :D
13:01  * matricks tunes in
19:25 <@minus> cake!
19:26 <@minus> too late, i already ate it
19:27 < rayv> Too bad. I have mine in oven
