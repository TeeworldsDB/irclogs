15:41 <@heinrich5991> minus: why did you ask? :)
16:12 <@minus> heinrich5991: wanna reimplement the masterserver in rust
16:12 <@heinrich5991> you don't need the tw protocol for that tbh
16:12 <@minus> i know
16:13 <@minus> would you do it with mio?
16:13 <@minus> or simple sockets + select
16:13 <@heinrich5991> I went for simple sockets with mio
16:14 <@heinrich5991> they have a nice select() abstraction "Poll"
16:14 <@heinrich5991> that actually calls epoll_* on linux instead of select
16:15 <@heinrich5991> check if the third bit of the packet is set
16:15 <@heinrich5991> if it is, disregard the first 6 bytes and you have your payload
16:16 <@heinrich5991> otherwise it's not a connless packet
16:17 <@minus> i know how the protocol works, i was just looking for boilerplate
16:22 <@heinrich5991> k
16:22 <@heinrich5991> my boilerplate doesn't do the low-level part
16:22 <@heinrich5991> it just parses packets
16:22 <@heinrich5991> and generates packets
16:23 <@heinrich5991> whcih is pretty easy for connless packets
20:32 <@minus> masters have been running fine since yesterday evening :)
20:58 < rand> Champagne!
