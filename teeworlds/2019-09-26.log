00:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It has travis ci afaik
01:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cant find it in readme tho
01:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh but its there: https://travis-ci.org/teeworlds/teeworlds
01:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well travis seems to be outdated then i guess
21:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think the grenade disconnect crash should be more urgently discussed, as it's a rather important issue.
22:34 < rand> is teeworlds standard using NULL or 0 for null pointer ?
22:34 < minus> std::nullptr
22:35 < minus> wait is that even a library thing
22:35 < minus> (i don't actually know what teeworlds uses)
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> teeworlds uses 0 and nULL at the same time xD for initializing pointers, cuz ppl thought it was cool to mix those :c
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nullptr would be the c++ this :'c
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thing*
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> NULL C style
22:55 < minus> is tw even C++11+?
22:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> no
23:01 < minus> !seen matricks
23:01 < Nimda3> I've last seen matricks 147 days, 22 hours, 54 minutes and 7 seconds ago in #teeworlds saying "nite".
