19:27 <+necropotame> Is it common to fetch images that are not in ./mapres with external images ? I'm using it for display tees in InfClass maps (./mapres/../skins/default.png for example), but I don't now if someone did it before, and if it's common or not. Said differently: is someone use other images that the vanilla ones in mapres ?
19:27 <+necropotame> don't know*
