08:11  * Pioyi slaps Q around a bit with a large fishbot
08:12 < Pioyi> Teeworlds is a nice game
08:13 < Pioyi> I hope you're making profit, it's even opensource
10:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It's a non-profit, there are no income sources since we stopped accepting donations years ago
12:37 < minus> yeah there's still a bunch of donation money afaik
12:38 < minus> time to get rid of it and spend it on blackjack and hookers
12:50 < ChillerDragon> wot how is the money not burning up?
12:50 < ChillerDragon> ah i guess website is hosted by Kottizen for free and masters as well
12:51 < ChillerDragon> time to use donation money to pay Robyt3
12:51 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1662547838.png
12:51 < ChillerDragon> that guy speedran rank 2 in 1 year
12:51 < ChillerDragon> gotta give him a medal
13:20 < minus> it's not enough money to really pay anyone
13:20 < minus> iirc it was like 900€
13:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> enough for hookers!
15:26 < ChillerDragon> xd
19:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <AssassinTee> xD that sounds like 11 juicy tournaments to me (with a  price pool of 80€ in total)
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> I like the way you are thinking Assa ^^
19:49 < ChillerDragon> That would be giving community donations to the community
19:50 < ChillerDragon> I think it makes more sense to put it into the project
19:50 < ChillerDragon> 900 is still a lot imo. You could even run web ads for teeworlds for that :D 
20:36 < minus> bounties was one idea
20:36 < ChillerDragon> security bug bounties?
20:36 < minus> bug bounties in general
20:37 < ChillerDragon> wait so you are saying 900 bucks is not enough to even give roby a cent for his efforts. But it is enough to move peopel from abusing/selling bugs and instead get a bounty xd
20:38 < ChillerDragon> or enough for a pro researcher to even bother looking it
20:40 < minus> no, i'm saying it isn't enough to actually pay someone
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> bounties was a thing we talked about and I was supposed to move forward with it, but it didn't seem at the time that anyone would really get extra motivated to work on an issue for a mediocre lump of money
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <AssassinTee> announce every bounty and you'll see how many participants pop up from nothing
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <AssassinTee> Also you could create a Teeworlds Meetup IRL with 100L free beer in some pub somewhere
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <AssassinTee> thinking about that, I think 100L free beer might be too expensive
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <AssassinTee> Overthinking anything as usual, I think you could really do a cool event with that. Imagine a bigger location with a big projector and highlights from the last 13 years of teeworlds, you could add some live stuff, too, like a teeworlds bingo/trivia, give an award to robyt and generally have a good time
22:05 < ChillerDragon> if you organize that ill give you a medal too
