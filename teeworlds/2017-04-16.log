17:51 < guenstig_werben> Just a quick question, does vanilla have friendly fire?
17:52 < EastByte> yes
17:52 < Henningstone> yes, configurable via sv_teamdamage
17:52 < guenstig_werben> Ah lol but noone uses it :P
17:53 < EastByte> I remember it being really annoying
17:53 < Henningstone> also it defaults to 0, so you'd have to enable it (for what you'd have to know about itâ€¦)
