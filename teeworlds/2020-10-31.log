14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> fwiw we just removed the taiwanese flag from traditional chinese as the chinese community made us feel like we were taking a political stance
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> 🤣
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> either way you do i guess
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The flag itself is still available as a player flag as we already call it region, not country
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I guess the taiwanese flag by itself is a bit of a political stance
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but removing the flag from the countryflags, eh
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> the problem is that taiwan doesn't have a flag
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well strictly speaking the problem is that taiwan doesn't exist, is not recognized as a country and thus can't have an official flag
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Don't most western countries recognize it as a country?
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> No, too scared of china
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> emoji just use a Republic of China's flag as taiwan's flag.
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> 🤨 But ISO standard taiwan is province of china
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> but ISO is pro china too.
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> wikipedia says Taiwan/RepublicOfChina is a country in East Asia
14:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/772083252906950696/unknown.png
14:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> As far as the hypocritical west is concerned, there is no taiwan, there is only Chinese Taipei
14:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Apparently only 5 UN members sort of recognize Taiwan
14:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> my understanding was that "Chinese Taipei" is a name that both sides are okay with
14:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> taiwan is schrodinger's cat, it is a country and it is not at the same time
14:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> is England a country?
14:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I'm not sure how fine someone from Taiwan would be about the name "Chinese Taipei"
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what I understood was that since both sides claim to be China they're both fine being called chinese
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It's sort of like England yeah, not sure if the chinese goverment allows regions to have flags except for the autonomous ones
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> 🤨 i don't think china the gov care too much. but china the population is extra stupid.
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> England does have a football team though
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> and they got the population so it is hard to clam them.
14:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> lol
14:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> and there is no problem about being able to pick the English flag in Teeworlds, it does not mean they are independent from UK, right
14:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> like if our town design a flag, as long as we don't fly them above china's flag, doubt anyone would care.
14:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Dune I doubt anyone in the UK would even care if we implied England was it's own country
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Anyway, calling it region seems to be the easiest course of action
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if we allow region flags we'll get a lot of regions asking for their flags though
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> ye, oy doesn't like the region idea.
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Is there an issue with that though? Flags are cool
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's an endless battle
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think we already have enough flags without people from brittany catalonia and what not asking theirs
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> and every other region in the world
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> 🤨 but we have the unicode baseline tho.
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Catalonia would indeed be an interesting one 😛
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> We could support just what unicode supports
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> 🇪🇺
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we already had problems with those
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I like the "stick with the football teams" policy
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> There is no official list of football teams anywhere is there? 😛
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> FIFA probably has one?
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> but if you use the FIFA one then macao is a problem
14:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> macao doesn't have a team?
14:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> nvm they do
14:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> but we are using ISO currently tho
14:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> We just need to hang in there until 2049 when china will integrate macao then we won't need to concern ourselves with this
14:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> 🤨
14:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> how about let's wait till the war begin then decide
14:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that sounds like a concern @Learath2 because we'd have to remove the flag from the game
14:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> although i don't think it is going to happen, since both gov's are yelling at each other about a war.
14:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> who announce they are going to have a war lol
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I think our best bet is to stick to a standard and push blame onto that when missing or extra flags are pointed out
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ISO-FIFA-1
14:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Heh
14:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> 🤨 i wanted to use the entire ISO standard. but that was apparently a bad idea too
14:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/772087327127240725/unknown.png
14:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Why? Just drop the independent flag, show it all under Country/Region
14:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> some of the missing one aren't real country, oy says.
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> i still think we can just call them "flags"
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> since they are ultimately, just "flags".
14:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> 🤨 then the "endless battle" is a thing
14:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> but i don't know why can't we call them "flags" while stick to the ISO standard
14:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> but i don't get why can't we call them "flags" while sticking to the ISO standard
14:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> "Country codes[2] defines codes for the names of countries, dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest" Region or Flag sound like a fine compromise to me, what's the harm in people showing the flag of antarctica? 😛
14:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the harm is a bunch of messages that say *hey guys why don't you show the flag of my region? what's the harm?*
14:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It's not in ISO3166 would be the reason
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> 🤨 wouldn't you just reply with the same reason you reply with ppl asking why taiwan is shown.
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> taiwan is shown because of ISO-FIFA-1 :p
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> then what's wrong with call them flags AND use "ISO-FIFA-1"
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think that's fine
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> emm what
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> FWIW FIFA recognizes taiwan under the name "Chinese Taipei" 😄
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> *that was not how it goes yesterday.*
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> really freddie?
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> idk. maybe i'm stupid.
14:28 < Oy> think we agreed yesterday that flags would be ok
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> oh
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/772089790858133504/unknown.png
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> i found the reason
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah that was my memory too, Oy
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> 211 countries are registered with FIFA, I guess that is indeed enough
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> freddiebrain not working 5am
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Sooo we are only using an interesting subset of ISO3166, those countries, dependent territories and subdivisions that also have a FIFA code
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> does that sound bad to you @Learath2
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> can't believe i was using the word "non-independent" yesterday.
14:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think it's a fine word
14:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> 😄
14:35 < Oy> think the currently not used ones are antarctica, french territories that have the same flag as france and another one that has the us flag
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Dune I think it works but I'm not sure if it solves the problem
14:35 < Oy> don't think there's a need to add them, as they're mostly duplicates
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Given both FIFA and the IOC had to rename taiwan to chinese taipei for china to even consider becoming a member again
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you need to click on the flag to see its name don't you? really need people to be looking to be offended for that to happen
14:37 < Oy> we don't have country names in tw, so the name thing shouldn't be an issue
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> let's just be careful about not adding them
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> sure. i didn't start doing the search function anyway.
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Oh, I guess then it's fine as is. ISO3166 without duplicates + antarctica doesn't sound bad
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I wish we could document this somewhere
14:39 < Oy> yeah, we should avoid that problem
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> i think we have ISO3166-1 written in the json file
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well we already use ISO3166 2 letter codes, I think that at least implies we are using ISO3166 listing
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> just something we can link someone to
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> maybe even a code comment?
14:40 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/datasrc/countryflags/index.json
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> maybe change "not used" to duplicate
14:40 < Oy> we have custom ones and ISO 3166-1 entries
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/9ad1642f7e781df5784321a499d7f43520b2a827/datasrc/countryflags/index.json#L1014
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> also if we change the name to "flags" we can add probably add antarctica?
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Actually we do list some subdivisions, it still leaves us with "Why is my subdivision not listed?"
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> uk is the only one i think. not counting the languages ones
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Turkish people would be rather unhappy if you add iraqs kurdistan subdivision 😄
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I think having a FIFA code is indeed a better criterion
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> should've just have europe/east asia/west asia/north america/south america etc instead of the country thing from the start (jk)
14:46 < Oy> though fifa flags might differ from the country flag
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> True, Taiwan uses their olympic flag for their football team
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> probably because Republic of China's flag isn't allowed
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I hate politics. I can't offer any further advice as I myself don't know what the best course of action would be. I guess we should just keep it like this and say no to requests for new flags
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> 🤨 tbh i don't know either. i'm just scared of ppl.
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> If someone asks us why we list UKs subdivisions we can say we are huge football fans, that should protect us from criticism
14:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @TsFreddie you can tell them it's more akin to England and Scotland. Neither of which are independent countries. Maybe that'll calm them down
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> oh trust me i've tried.
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> we were using chinese translation to evade some anger. then they saw the english text and then ddnet changed it i think.
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Country is technically correct for "England" btw. The UK is a collection of countries
14:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> which is what they've googled to attack me when I explained.
14:56 < Oy> we can change "country" to "flag" in the ui and "not used" to "duplicates" in the json index file. then it should be fine
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> ye.
14:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well being called a "country" doesn't imply anything. There is no sovereignty implied by somewhere being called a country. Leave it to non-native speakers to misunderstand terms like this
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Interesting, I didn't know. Is there an equivalent word in german or that's an english concept?
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Also, we unfortunately have translations
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't think french has a word that doesn't imply sovereignty for example
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well the turkish word for country doesn't imply sovereignty either
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> But the term Country itself is a veeeery problematic term. It caused many diplomatic issues all over the world
15:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> 🤨 To fully explain what countries actually means in chinese probably would take one or two sentences. otherwise it just means nations.
15:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> UK literately translate to "the england nation" in chinese. it is really hard for chinese to understand why UK is multiple countries.
15:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> There is a reason the UN adopted "State" and "Sovereign State" which don't have debatable definitions when talking about this thing
15:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well that was the intention
15:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Then people decided to debate them aswell 😛
15:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> edit: "the eng nation" since we only take a single syllable.
15:07 < Oy> Dune the the correct german word would be "Land", when you use "Staat" you imply sovereignty
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> doesn't 英国 sometimes mean England too?
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> If I wanted to translate this into turkish and make it abundantly clear, I would translate it from "region" instead
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Oy: interesting :D
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so we should really say Deutschstaat
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> ye, which is why the translation is just england nation.
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so there is an ambiguous word that can mean both England and UK
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> There is no separate word for UK in chinese?
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> there is.
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> the great british kingdom
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Huh, the japanese call it the "english country"
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> which is super long and no one say it in full name
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Learath2 think there is the long version 連合王国
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> 大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> God I hate diplomacy
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you're gonna love FOSS
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> "free" is another one of those words with way too many different meanings crammed into it
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I wonder if there is a name for these kinds of words
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there is
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> polysemic?
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> "A polyseme is a word or phrase with different, but related senses"
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> btw who found out the "play game" and "play demo" need different context. cuz that saved chinese translation as well.
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> *raises hand* (I think)
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> it is different in french too
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> cool
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Huh, didn't think it would be different in french
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I'm not sure now
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I thought jouer goes for both "playing a movie" and "playing a game"
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah I'm doubting
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> (Though my fluency in french is really questionable so I'm not to be trusted 😛 )
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so is mine
15:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> i guess depends on whether it is you click something to play something, or something is playing something as a tool.
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> uh
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> i'm guessing. i know nothing about french :P
15:25 < Oy> different in german too
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It's different in turkish. "Oynat" for play as in play the movie, "oyna" for play as in play the game
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> that's so similar
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> for two different meaning
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think @TsFreddie is right for french, playing music means actively making the music
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> woah.
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well both are derived from "Oyun" which means game. Modern turkish is heavily inspired by french
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> interesting. we use completely different word for playing movie vs playing games. i imagine japanese is the same.
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The one you'd use for a film is actually a conjugation of the one for the game, something along the lines of "to make it play".
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Do tees speak a language?
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think they at least say hi when they spawn?
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/11
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> of course there is an issue for that
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> an really old one too..
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I think in japanese you just "do" the game but you "do playback of" the film/movie
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Oh and in italian too they are completely different
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> i know 再生. which is always funny to us
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You reproduce the movie, sound the music, play the game
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well those are modern words, right, romans didn't have movies to play
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The french upgraded from the weird latinisms and just uses jouer for all of them afaik
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I know about 500 kanji and I still didn't know the first one :/
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> french is just vulgar illiterate latin
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Still so much to learn
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> japanese don't usually have a single meaning within a kanji right?
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I'd say they do?
15:37 < Oy> romans had theatres. their kinda movies :D
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's the combination that tweaks the meaning
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It's quite odd, they do have multiple meanings but also a "principal" meaning
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> right. the combination usually don't change the meaning in chinese.
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> unless the word is made to sound like another language, then the kanji have almost no meanings in context.
15:38 < Oy> think we don't have a sound guy. so https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/11 probably not gonna happen
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> RIP https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2388 possibly
15:39 < Oy> that's why we don't have any new weapons :D
15:39 < Oy> Dune: yeah
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> isn't it because teeworlds is super conservative with gameplay :D
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @TsFreddie become our sound guy
15:40 < Oy> that's another reason :P
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> emm what
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I'm sure you'd figure it out 😛
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we had @Fisico for a short while
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> i've only done 8bit sound before and they were almost random.
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> high pitch them and they're suddenly teeish
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> i do like what valve done with the two robot's voice in portal 2
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> i can here chinese in them sometime
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> hear*
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> to me it feels like any variation of "hou han" is valid chinese, just like any cat-over-keyboard is valid regex
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie 🌈> and they also make sense with the pinging system which is cool. the blue one just say "there" in chinese when he ping somewhere.
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I recently spoke with Fisico about the race sounds I think he said they are done only two sounds are yet to be made or something
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> oh, so it's intentional
