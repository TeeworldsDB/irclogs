08:46 < day> 18:32 < BotScratcher> Title: made random_int() just return positive values.
08:46 < day> random?
08:46 < day> what is it used for?
08:49 <@matricks> day: crapnet it seems
08:49 <@matricks> sound system
08:49 <@matricks> fake server
08:49 <@matricks> network
08:50 <@matricks> stuff like that
11:40 <@matricks> cheating, aimbot, http://i.imgur.com/3pi1HF7.gifv
12:00 < EastByte> I think this aimbot can be easily detected, I want a stealth version of that
12:03 < allu2> I can see future applications for this in google glass kind of products :P
12:33 < Sadale> cool vid :)
12:34 < Sadale> Would be even better if it can display the force required for the strike.
12:35 < EastByte> "Try to hit with a velocity of x m/s"
13:47 <@heinrich5991> "this aimbot"?
13:57 <@minus> matricks: nice, but assumes you can hit the ball at the precise center
14:07 <@heinrich5991> oh, somehow I missed one message
14:12 < day> did Sd` play for Qi// or ~MS~? the name looks familiar
14:28 <@matricks> minus: dunno
14:28 <@matricks> minus: but yeah, it doesn't take spin into account I guess
14:55 < Obani> Guys ?
14:56 < Obani> As there are many clients
14:56 < Obani> Don't you think a teeworlds launcher would be a good idea ?
14:56 < Obani> Especially for Steam in fact
14:56 < Obani> You could add clients as DLCs and choose them in the launcher
14:56 < Obani> Just choose the path to the client, and here it go !
15:01 < Obani> goes*
16:05 <@matricks> not for offical teeworlds
16:15 < Obaniafk> matricks, really ? :/
16:16 < Obaniafk> Not even a separated repository ? (like moving blocks organization did)
16:40 <@matricks> Obaniafk: it's not our job to promote mods, other clients etc etc
17:41 < Obaniafk> matricks, what would be teeworlds without its mods ?
17:59 <@minus> a nice games without shitty mods
18:26 < BotScratcher> New commit: [ fixed some unclear code safety. Closes #1285 ] by [ oy ] on [ https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/dbc43249a5e17125c829775cd94aa9bc14fd0a44 ]
18:50 < Obaniafk> minus, you hate so much mods ?
18:50  * matricks might have missed a few lines
18:51 <@minus> with mods it's a game with some shitty mods
18:51 <@minus> certainly not all
18:51 < Obani> Or do you hate mod makers :p
18:52 < Obani> Well I played teeworlds for a year without playing a game in ctf/dm/tdm
18:52 < Obani> to*
22:59 < rand> Well, I played teeworlds for 7 years and i can count with my hands mod games I played
23:00 <@matricks> rand: try your head, it can keep bigger numbers :)
23:01 < rand> but i have only one head! 
23:01 <@matricks> go ask zaphod
23:02 < rand> :D
