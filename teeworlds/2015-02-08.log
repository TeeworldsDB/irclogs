03:59 < JulianAssange> does that even matter heinrich5991 
04:04 < JulianAssange> so here's an interesting C question: is it possible to make a function uncallable, except through a macro?
08:07 <@matricks> JulianAssange: I have a suspect yes....
08:21 < JulianAssange> what?
08:24 <@matricks> the c question
08:26 < JulianAssange> oh
08:27 < JulianAssange> how's that?
08:27 < JulianAssange> other than just naming it some completely random thing, and making the macro named something real

08:28 <@matricks> minus: there was a similar thing released before which was better :/
08:47 < allu2> Somehow that reminded me of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1eNjUgaB-g

08:53 < LittleWhite> Sure, a really nice demo :)
09:32 <@minus> morning
09:33 <@minus> matricks posts a xm and LittleWhite appears, that can't be a coincident :D
09:34  * minus np: FantomenK - Tiny Tunes
09:37 <@minus> i see, that was less about the music in the xm
09:41 < LittleWhite> Morning minus :)
11:29 < JulianAssange> allu2: that reminds me of tron
11:41 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: have you tried naming the function exactly as the macro? :)
11:46 < JulianAssange> yes
11:46 < JulianAssange> #define fFileContains(fileloc, needle, ...) fFileContains(fileloc,  __VA_ARGS__)
11:47 < JulianAssange> bool fFileContains(const char *fileloc, char const *needle, ...);
11:50 < JulianAssange> o ok
