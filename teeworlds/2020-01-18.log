13:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what's the difference between `GAME_RELEASE_VERSION` and `GAME_VERSION` in src/game/version.h?
13:37 < Dune> @heinrich5991 if you go back to 0.7.3.1, one was only "0.7.3"
13:37 < Dune> I think one of them is sent to the server as identification (GAME RELEASE VERSION)
13:37 < Dune> the other one is just for printing
13:38 < Dune> might be wrong, given that it's a 8 char array and there is a CLIENT_VERSION anyway
13:40 < Oy> could probably remove GAME_VERSION
13:42 < Oy> it's just used in the server info sent by the server. in the past we changed GAME_VERSION to 0.x.x trunk after the release to indicate that's not the release version and it's worked on
13:43 < Dune> ah, so for major releases
13:44 < Oy> no every release, we probably didn't GAME_VERSION for 0.7.3.1 cause there was just a simple client change and the server was untouched
15:55 < Dune> still need versionsrv testing?
16:02 < Oy> yeah
16:02 < Oy> the official one doesn't work
16:03 < Oy> can't produce that with a local one
16:04 < Oy> tried 32/64 bit, bam /cmake build everyone worked for me
16:08 < Dune> huh and the official one is a recent build for sure?
16:11 < Oy> yeah, heinrich5991 also tried the one from 0.7.3.1 release didn't work either
16:11 < Oy> doesn't send anything back
21:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> oof, he using his own money earning link to earn some starting money ðŸ˜®
23:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> kinda failing to get any response from the master server and a local master server doesn't have any proper debugging output...
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> your hosting your own local master servers?
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> for testing only
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thought in debugging the masterserver might have some helpful debug messages. it doesn't
