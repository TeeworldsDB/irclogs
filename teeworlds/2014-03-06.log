16:59 < BotoX> two hp microservers, one N36L, one N40L. two new seagate SV35 2TB drives, one used with 4.5k hours: no errors and a wd green with 16.5k hours, no errors at all too. + one intel gbit nic and one has 1G ram other has 2G ram
16:59 < BotoX> so, each server has 2 HDDs
17:00 < BotoX> for 2x140€
17:00 <@minus> would not buy
17:00 < BotoX> oh and each server comes with an additional 250gb hdd taped to where the CD drive is
17:00 < BotoX> it's a pretty good price honestly, I just bought them for him and am shipping it now
17:01 < BotoX> the two new HDDs cost 2x80€ alone + the used one ~50€ is already 210€
17:02 <@minus> :/
17:02 <@minus> but 2TB
17:02 <@minus> so 2009
17:02 < BotoX> Well, you can fit 5 drives inside
17:02 <@minus> my 5x2TB are almost full
17:02 < BotoX> I got 4x2TB and one 3TB in the CD drive, it also has an eSATA port on the outside lel
17:02 <@minus> gotta 5x5TB!
17:02 < BotoX> >5TB
17:03 <@minus> or were there even 6TB ones?
17:03 < BotoX> helium drives
17:03 < BotoX> that'll be expensive

19:48 < BotoX> tfw compiling systemd
19:50 <@minus> compiling is great fun on a quadcore i7 with 32GB of RAM
19:50 <@matricks> heh
19:50 <@matricks> or my machine at work.. :)
19:50 <@matricks> 12 cores + ht :)
19:50 <@minus> compiled some qt software, just required 10 gigs of RAM
19:51 <@minus> matricks: how often do you http://xkcd.com/303/?
19:54 <@minus> matricks: time to switch to distributed compiling
19:59 < BotoX> time to get four Xeon E7s
19:59 < BotoX> gotta have 4*12cores
20:00 <@minus> what about the 15 core ones?
20:00 < BotoX> http://ark.intel.com/products/79209
20:00 < BotoX> right
20:00 < BotoX> was about to say that
20:00 < BotoX> 8 x 15 cores x 3.6GHz
20:00  * minus np: lft - Turbulence
20:00  * BotoX * #teeworlds :Cannot send to channel
20:00 <@minus> though luck, mate
20:00 < BotoX> stop being so racist ;_;
20:01 < BotoX> my colorfull now playing line can't come through
20:01 < BotoX> yay the hexacore finished compiling systemd!
20:14 < BotoX> Well, patched the two servers it was happening on, lets see wether it fixes the issue
20:18 <@matricks> minus: too often...
20:18 <@matricks> minus: we tried suing distributed but there were to many problems
20:19 <@matricks> *using
20:19 <@minus> too bad
20:19  * minus np: aMUSIC, Leviathan [GR], ASD - Tortuga Turtle
20:20  * matricks is back from studying and back to fixing bugs

20:21 <@matricks> and then another one in the future, and then a test
20:23 <@matricks> for the next paragliding pilot level
20:24  * minus plays the super mario mushroom sound
20:24 <@matricks> it's more or less the last licence level
20:25 <@matricks> after that you have some special stuff that you can take like acro, tandem and competition..
20:25 <@matricks> but next no more levels... except instructor I guess
20:26 <@matricks> erh.. not metrology...
20:26 <@matricks> meteorology
