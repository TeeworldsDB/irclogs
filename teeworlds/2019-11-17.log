16:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> you wont believe me
16:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i found the bug why my server cannot reach master anymore after logging in to rcon
16:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I commented out `m_aClients[ClientID].m_pRconCmdToSend = Console()->FirstCommandInfo(AUTHED_ADMIN - AuthLevel, CFGFLAG_SERVER);`, so I dont send the commands for auto completion anymore. I dont know why, but this caused it. I have very many custom rcon commands, about 120 i guess
16:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> It is just too much
16:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> for the server
16:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Do you have any idea how I can fix it? xd
16:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Are those sent all at once? If yes maybe send them in chunks
17:34 < Learath2> I'd wager it's an issue with the queue and rcon completion packets being vital
17:34 < Learath2> So, less packets should be a better idea
17:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> How do I send less packets?
18:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @fokkonaut congratz on troubleshooting it down
18:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thanks
