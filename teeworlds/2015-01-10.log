16:15 < Guichi> Hello people
16:16 < rayv> hello Guichi 
16:16 < allu2> Yo
16:18 <@matricks> HERRO!
16:18 < Guichi> I'm wondering a little something about master servers rules, is anyone able to help me? :P
16:21 < Guichi> I don't want to break a rule not on purpose :c (i don't want to break any rule on purpose either btw)
16:24 < heinrich5991> Guichi: what's your question?
16:24 < Guichi> Say you have a modified server that is able to run original gametypes as well (on server vote for example), is it allowed to broadcast as vanilla ctf when playing wanilla ctf?
16:25 <@matricks> no
16:25 <@matricks> any modifications what so ever and you are not allowed to broadcast it as CTF, DM or TDM
16:26 <@matricks> those are reserved for the offical code
16:26 < Guichi> Even if original gamemodes are not modified? just another gametype on vote?
16:26 <@matricks> nope
16:26 < Guichi> Okay, thanks
16:27 <@matricks> you could argu about those kinda cases but inorder to keep it simple, modified code -> non CTF, DM TDM
16:27 < heinrich5991> we need to clarify on these rules btw
16:27 < heinrich5991> -on
16:27 < Guichi> So there's no way to host a server that offers original + modified gamemodes then?
16:28 <@matricks> several servers? :)
16:28 < heinrich5991> Guichi: under the current rules, no :/
16:28 < heinrich5991> not on a single server
16:28 < Guichi> Haha right :P okay
16:28 < heinrich5991> there's some people running multikill-broadcaster on vanilla
16:28 < Guichi> That's a bot connected on econ
16:28 < heinrich5991> yes, but still
16:28  * allu2 is the author :P
16:28 < Guichi> well, i wouldn't consider the server code to be modified in that case :P
16:28 < heinrich5991> does that matter?
16:29 < heinrich5991> what matters is what is shown to the user
16:29 < heinrich5991> you could also put a reverse-proxy in front of a vanilla server and do strange things
16:29 <@matricks> a server that presents itself as a DM/TDM/CTF server must behave like one as well
16:29 < allu2> Would it be forbidden to hire person to make killing spree messages?
16:30 < heinrich5991> because no one would do it, it doesn't really matter
16:30 <@matricks> allu2: yes, it's forbidden to be that stupid :)
16:30 < Guichi> matricks: that's why I thought about the edge case of original+modified server, in some sort it still behaves like original :P
16:30 < allu2> If point is to not have messages other then Vanilla ones, wouldn't it be easier to remove say and broadcast commands from the server?
16:31 <@matricks> well, the broadcast stuff is useful for admins
16:32 < heinrich5991> allu2: and this modified server problem can't be mitigated by technical means only
16:32 <@matricks> it's very hard to make something bombproof :/
16:34 < allu2> Hum, I mean my project (TeeBot2) uses only econ and commands available to the server. Sure I can't do much more then statistics and reacting to events by saying something, basicly stuff that doesn't affect gameplay. But if its functionality is forbidden in my opinion best place to restrict that kind of functionality is at the source, like if you remove broadcast and say, my bot has no means to communicate
16:34 < allu2> to clients :P
16:34 <@matricks> allu2: well, then we have to restrict and remove all chat..
16:35 < heinrich5991> allu2: people could connect a bot to the server which does the same thing
16:35 <@matricks> which I've thought about :D
16:35  * allu2 feels he beat matricks to it :P
16:36 < Guichi> No please let my 'Headshot!' taunt :c
16:36 < allu2> That kind of client based bot would require bit more work I think, also would eat one player spot :P
16:37 < allu2> Are the rules going to be edited to be in form that forbits affecting the vanilla experienced shown to clients?
16:38 < allu2> Cause in that case I'll have to remove the functionality it has to say/broadcast, though I'd then probably just make it update some dynamic website of statistics for nick/realtime
20:41 < Toast> any1 here, who is very good in mysql queries?
23:52 < Pringers> Hello?
