15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I have a special question, can you do colored broadcasts in ddnet, too?
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I know that you can do them in 0.7
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> with for example `^900Hello World`  you can do a red `Hello World`
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nope, only if ddnet would implement that
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> :/
16:10 < minus> why not just use a subtitle renderer for text, like libass, solves the color problem
16:10 < minus> and potentionally also gives your animation, vector graphics and image support
16:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> libass
16:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> hihi
16:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> idk if anyone wants animation or images in broadcast and the colors work just fine dont they?
20:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> library for butts
