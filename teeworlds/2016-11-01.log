08:06 < rand> What's wrong with people ? When did ddos become popular ?
08:12 < EastByte> about 6 years ago, I guess
08:14 < EastByte> atleast, until 2010 I never experienced such attacks
09:11 < rand> a friend of mine made a InfClass server, few days after, ddos
09:22 < EastByte> well, we have some good news, though
09:22 < EastByte> ddosing based on amplification or simple spoofing is constantly getting more expensive and less effective
09:26 < necropotame> rand, which InfClass server ?
09:27 < rand> i don't know the name/ip, i don't play infclass
09:33 < necropotame> ok
11:37 < Stitch626> ehm. from my position ddos attacks became late 2012 be more popular, because of the block scene....
11:37 < Stitch626> AppleCider is hosting something useful?
11:48 < rand> about the infclass that got ddos, a guy seems to have a hater named Stitch262 that ddos the servers where he is playing
11:48 < EastByte> evil Stitch626 being evil
11:48 < rand> 3:>
16:46 < Stitch626> bad rand rly bad. <3
16:48 < rand> â™¥
16:49 < Keep1> ^^
16:49 < Stitch626> awwww. :D
16:57 < rand> necropotame: i may have fixed the segfault issue
16:58 < rand> at least, the bots won't leave for the same reason as the last segfault
16:59 < Keep1> rand: good !
16:59 < rand> basically, i forget to check all the netserver.send call. the server tried to send a packet to the bot, failed, netserver drop the bot (that is a virtual client), then it's undefined behavior
