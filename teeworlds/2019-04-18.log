03:37 < TeeSlayer> https://lolinet.info new website! :D
03:41 < TeeSlayer> I should really migrate to the new simple ddrace fork, but I'm too lazy :/
10:40 < Dune> I'm still waiting for your prs :p
11:54 < TeeSlayer> Dune: https://github.com/SNSnoop/mkrace is already the best fork right now
11:55 < TeeSlayer> however it uses the old map format
11:55 < TeeSlayer> meaning that all my porting work was for nothing
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if it's a fork you should be able to just pull the additional commits
13:14 < minus> hm, got an email from mod.io about integrating it into teeworlds
13:14 < minus> it's a modding platform/store thingie for multiple games
13:15 < minus> interesting idea, but neither feasible nor wanted for teeworlds
13:25 < TeeSlayer> Dune: that's not the problem
13:25 < TeeSlayer> the maps are
13:28 < TeeSlayer> the scores would have to be adjusted too for the "new parts"
13:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> he reverted something about how the maps work? eh
13:53 < minus> does anyone even respond to mail sent to info@teeworlds,com? matricks_? Dune? heinrich5991?
13:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I do, but there are just automated/batch mails usually
13:54 < minus> probably makes sense to CC info@ when replying
13:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> will remember to
13:58 <@heinrich5991> minus: I don't get any mail from there
14:00 <@heinrich5991> (or I don't realize I do)
14:04 < Dune> they are fairly frequent
14:19 < Dune> anyone got ideas for a config name for the game ready warmup?
14:19 < Dune> sv_start_warmup ?
14:20 < Dune> countdown?
14:25 < Dune> sv_start_countdown?
14:28 <@heinrich5991> it should determine whether hte warmup exists or not?
14:28 < Dune> "Number of seconds to freeze the game in a countdown before match starts (0 enables only for survival gamemodes, -1 disables)"
14:29 <@heinrich5991> isn't that sv_warmup or so already?
14:29 <@heinrich5991> (I don't remember)
14:30 < Dune> you cannot disable the game start timer
14:30 < Dune> the 3 seconds thing
14:30 < Dune> sv_warmup cannot pilot it
20:36 < Dune> > 335 commits to master since this release
20:36  * Dune cries in changelog
20:37 < minus> git log 0.7.2..master >> changelog
20:37 < Dune> add in a | grep -v "
20:37 < Dune> fixed last commit"
20:38 < minus> =D
20:38 < minus> oh, last release was almost 4 months ago
20:38 < minus> better release something quick
20:38 < Dune> one release per season
20:39 < minus> 0.8 would be neat
20:39 < minus> last chance to overtake ZFS
20:39 < Dune> we can arbitrarily change the protocol to release 0.8
20:39 < Fudgy> Any new functionality planned before 0.7.3?
20:39 < Dune> Yes Fudgy :)
20:39 < minus> actually breaking backwards compatibility should cause a major version change if you'd go by sember
20:39 < minus> semver*
20:40 < minus> and new features would up the minor version
20:40 < Dune> that's how teeworlds works, right
20:40 < minus> wink wink nudge nudge
20:41 < minus> we'd probably be at 7.2 then
20:41 < Dune> I told some friend I was working on teeworlds and he asked "the soldat clone?"
20:41 < Dune> didn't know some people knew soldat better than teeworlds
20:42 < minus> :D
20:42 < minus> i've never considered it a soldat clone
20:42 < Dune> which one came first?
20:43 < minus> would be cool if they finally released the next version of it; it'll have linux support
20:43 < minus> soldat
20:43 < minus> 2002 vs 2007
20:43 < Dune> 2007? damn, teeworlds came in just a bit before android?
20:44 < Fudgy> Any game someone can say Teeworlds is a clone of has worse gameplay/movement anyway
20:44 < minus> soldat has the cannonball tho
20:44 < Dune> well clones tend to be better
20:45 < minus> man, i even forgot if i know how to do the cannon ball
20:46 < Dune> can you play it with a joystick tho :D
20:47 < minus> no, but you can't do that with teeworlds either
20:47 < minus> (i tried)
20:47 < Dune> you only need two joysticks :D
20:49 < minus> i used a gamepad
21:39 < Dune> somehow when I used +stats without a parameter the scoreboard wouldn't close
21:39 < Dune> need to look into it
22:17 < Dune> it's strange, removing the parameter breaks it :|
22:18 < Dune> when I press the key, "+stats 1" is sent, when I release the key, "+stats" is sent
22:20 < Oy> will take a look tomorrow
22:21 < Dune> okay :)
