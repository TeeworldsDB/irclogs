04:45 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: I posted a link for secure key exchange
04:47 <@heinrich5991> that works over a secure connection AFAIU: when you do the exchange with a server that doesn't know the password, the server will get one attempt at guessing the password
04:47 <@heinrich5991> i.e. basically no accidental password exposure
04:49 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: if you want to avoid dtls for some reason (maybe sth like overhead), just use whatever mosh is using ^^
16:13 < Fels> oink
21:04 < eeeee> heinrich5991: such secure password exchange would definitely be an improvement over plaintext passwords in a sense that the plaintext password won't leak, but as i understand a mitm would still be able to hijack the current session
21:06 < eeeee> so some kind of a more complicated scheme for transport integrity is required anyway
21:11 <@heinrich5991> eeeee: I don't think a mitm could hijack the session
21:12 <@heinrich5991> you build up a secure connection with someone
21:12 <@heinrich5991> (either eve or bob)
21:13 <@heinrich5991> then you prove that you are in possession of the secret, but this proof includes the secret of the connection
21:14 <@heinrich5991> but then eve either can't read the proof (because she didn't intercept the secure connection) or is in possession of the proof of the password that is useless to her as it is bound to the connection alice-eve
