14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> testâ€¦
14:36 <@heinrich5991> okay, now a whitelist of users will be able to send messages to IRC
14:37 <@heinrich5991> let's hope that this will work out better
14:37 <@minus> sounds pointless
14:38 <@heinrich5991> people not using IRC clients - people who wnat to have a backlog but don't have a bouncer
14:41 <@minus> my point stands :D
14:45 < pinkieval> I think I'll host a public instance of IRCAnywhere, to finally end that argument against IRC
14:46 <@heinrich5991> which argument? what is IRCanywhere?
14:46 < pinkieval> IRCAnywhere is a web client with a backlog
14:46 <@heinrich5991> ah
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Nibiru> Well the quakenet's web client does the same job except the backlog
14:49 < pinkieval> uh
14:49 < pinkieval> last commit in 2015
14:50 < rand> "except backlog"
14:51 < rand> backlog is life
14:52 < pinkieval> ooor you could use Mattermost instead of Discord
14:53 <@heinrich5991> what's mattermost?
14:53 < pinkieval> an open source clone of Discord
14:53 < pinkieval> and it's way more usable
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Nibiru> Of slack*
14:53 <@heinrich5991> rocketchat was open source of slack IIRC
14:53 < pinkieval> yeah
14:54 < pinkieval> I never quite understood the difference between Slack and Discord, actually
14:54 <@heinrich5991> I don't know slack
14:54 < pinkieval> except that Discord is litterally more than 100 times slower than my IRC client, while Slack is only twice slower
14:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Nibiru> Slack has no voice and you have to register an account on each of rooms
14:56 <@heinrich5991> discord is one of these "let's run a web browser to display our program"
14:56 <@heinrich5991> :(
14:56 <@minus> Mattermost is under the gitlab umbrella and it's not that great
14:56 < pinkieval> heinrich5991: I think running my IRC client on a Linux running in the web browser would be faster than Discord
14:57 <@minus> Most certainly
14:59 < pinkieval> let's try
15:01 < deen> pinkieval: sounds like a good case for https://bellard.org/jslinux/
15:01 < rand> xD
15:02 < pinkieval> deen: that's exactly what I'm using right now
15:08 < deen> pinkieval: Thank you for subscribing to Fabrice Bellard facts
15:08 < deen> When you start writing a C compiler, add cross-compiling, turn that into a recompiler, use it as a virtual machine and you end up with qemu.
15:08 < deen> JSLinux started with code written in JS, converted that to C, and then compiled into JS again using emscripten.
15:11 < pinkieval> you forgot ffmpeg
15:13 < deen> Actually before tcc there was obfuscated tcc: https://bellard.org/otcc/otcc.c
15:16 < pinkieval> damn, so many packages I have to install
15:17 < pinkieval> lazy
15:17 < deen> haha, you should use a smaller irc client: https://tools.suckless.org/ii/
15:17 < deen> or even https://tools.suckless.org/sic/
15:17 < pinkieval> let's not be unreasonable
15:23 <@heinrich5991> pinkieval: https://thelounge.github.io/ that's still in development
