19:15 < Learath2> Guess if we ever move over to 0.7 we'll need to keep the old hack to snap only the 16 closest players for vanilla clients
19:16 < Oy> or decrease to 16 players

19:19 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 3010a3a oy: made the version server work again. closes #1407
19:19 < Learath2> No thank you, we've been running 64 player servers for the last 6 years. I doubt the playerbase would appreciate a downgrade
19:26 < Oy> well, then there's the other option. we'll stick to 16 players for teeworlds - people would mind going back to 12 i guess
19:31 <@Dune> hey
19:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @oy did posted my list of contributors in the issue...
19:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> *did post
19:31 < Learath2> hi Dune
19:32 < Oy> hey
19:32 < Oy> Fisico: yeah, already answered
19:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> cool thanks
19:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> do you know if landil did maps?
19:33 <@Dune> it's troublesome to list coders-only
19:33 <@Dune> github has some contributors that may not be coders
19:33 <@Dune> might as well list them all in a bunch imo
19:33 < Oy> Fisico don't think so
19:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> dune, you can filter them out.. we have a artis/docu/maps list soon
19:34 < Oy> Dune: no need to list coders, it's just about the content.
19:34 <@Dune> oh, alright then
19:34 <@Dune> I feel like we're missing maps people
19:34 <@Dune> ctf7 is @LordSk/Steph iirc
19:34 <@Dune> ctf8 is @Sonix
19:34 <@Dune> ctf6?
19:35 < Oy> no idea :P
19:35 <@Dune> @LordSk or @Sonix might know
19:35 < Oy> i remember Pocram tiled most of the 0.6 maps
19:37 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> oO ok will add him
19:37 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ctf7 lordsk.. but he cant remeber if steph helped him
19:37 <@Dune> steph definitely did
19:38 <@Dune> I was there
19:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok
19:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> alright if Dune says so haha
19:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> oy do you know if serpis did maps?
19:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> he did graphic stuff with teetow so maybe also maps
19:41 < rand> o/
19:42 <@Dune> I moved the score first on the scoreboard, not sure if I agree with the change though
19:43 < Oy> Fisico no idea if serpis did maps, teetow might know ;)
19:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> is teetow still online?
19:43 <@Dune> he's on irc
19:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> oh cool
19:44 < Oy> Dune: probably looks odd if u seperate score from kill, deaths
19:44 <@Dune> my thoughts too
19:45 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1695
19:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UWElbkUzLhuoTiL6swj9l8sesKjV7ts6oSE4irMJYh0/edit?usp=sharing
19:45 < Oy> these gameplay informations shouldn't be seperated
19:45 <@Dune> yeah
19:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> looks strange, cause K/D is not there... but it's also good that the score is first in the table... not sure...
19:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> moving K/D is also strange
19:47 <@Dune> definitely don't move K/D
19:55 <@Dune> I would like to summon Landil for the quit button :<
19:56 < Oy> is that so important? flip a coin :D
19:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah make a decision Dune, and piss off half the people
19:58 <@Dune> hahaha
19:58 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpl70
19:58 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 7b51a1f oy: some token polishing
19:59 < Learath2> Dune: what are you trying to decide about?
19:59 <@Dune> I can't imagine how the design discussions for git options went
20:00 <@Dune> Learath2: the quit button, https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1683
20:00 <@Dune> there are some options like --unshallow
20:00 < Learath2> git options?
20:00 <@Dune> I guess linus just shouts on people
20:00 <@Dune> maybe we need matricks to write angry mails
20:00 < Learath2> git mostly follows a development principle of serving community needs nowadays, and the original set of git stuff is just linus saying what he wants
20:01 <@Dune> right
20:02 < Learath2> Dune: round only 2 corners to piss everyone off instead
20:02 <@Dune> Learath2: which
20:02 <@Dune> :D
20:02 < Learath2> top left and top right
20:02 <@Dune> hahaha
20:02 < Learath2> honestly I'd go for only bottom left
20:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> thank you
20:03 <@Dune> eh, just post that, that makes 3-1-1 and I can just go for it with absolute majority :D
20:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> dune make the X button as big(hight) as the buttons are, square it, put it in the corner and round all corner except the top right one, Done
20:04 <@Dune> haha, so you vote for 3 fisico.
20:05 < Learath2> Dune: btw are you using a font for the quit button now?
20:05 <@Dune> no
20:05 <@Dune> but I guess I should
20:05 <@Dune> no exit button is coming its way
20:05 < Learath2> yes, helps with scaling
20:05 <@Dune> we depend on zatline for the remaining graphics issues
20:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i also don't mind if only the bottom left corner is round
20:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and another joins the right-people's ranks
20:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ðŸ˜„
20:07 < Learath2> did you release 0.7 on steam?
20:07 <@Dune> no, 0.7.0 will not be released on steam Learath2
20:08 < Learath2> huh, why not? it might be a good source of players
20:08 <@Dune> because that's what 0.7.1 is for :)
20:08 < Learath2> I see
20:08 <@Dune> 0.7.0 doesn't have binaries on teeworlds.com either
20:11 <@Dune> if I make it a font, it will become black on hover :/
20:12 < Learath2> how are you rendering the text or handling the hover?
20:12 <@Dune> there is no text right now
20:12 <@Dune> but the UI functions do that
20:12 < Learath2> guess something changed on the way to 0.7
20:13 <@Dune> eh well i²ll just use ui->dolabel
20:13 <@Dune> maybe
20:14 < Oy> Dune: dolabel and buttonlogic
20:14 <@Dune> right
20:14 < Oy> search and copy ;)
20:15 < Learath2> does dobutton_menutab not exist anymore?
20:15 < Learath2> or does it have hover now?
20:18 < Oy> so much changed, there're lots of button things now... - that should be cleaned up
20:19 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpldu
20:19 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master a99addc oy: show current resolution in graphics settings
20:19 <@Dune> Learath2: still exists
20:19 <@Dune> Oy: yeah a lot could be done for the UI
20:20  * Dune coughs
20:20 <@Dune> scrollbars
20:20  * Dune coughs
20:20 < Oy> worsed thing is DoButton_SpriteClean
20:20 <@Dune> I used DoButton_SpriteCleanID for the quit button :D
20:20 < Oy> it doesn't use the button logic, so it messes with everything
20:21 < Oy> yeah, that's better
20:21 <@Dune> lol and spritecleanID does
20:21 <@Dune> counterintuitive
20:27 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/EVAra18.png
20:27 <@Dune> it's not centered D:
20:30 < Learath2> well how did you end up rendering it at the end?
20:31 <@Dune> dolabel
20:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> X is to small ðŸ˜„
20:36 < Learath2> well did you calculate the position correctly? dobutton_menutab centers it properly for me
20:42 < Learath2> You passed CUI::ALIGN_CENTER right?
21:24 <@Dune> yeah, position probably wrongly calculated
21:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> XText.HMargin(Button.h>=20.0f?2.0f:1.0f, &XText);
21:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune>                 UI()->DoLabel(&XText, "\u2715", XText.h*ms_FontmodHeight, CUI::ALIGN_CENTER);
21:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune>                 if(UI()->DoButtonLogic(s_QuitButton.GetID(), "\u2715", 0, &Button))
22:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Fisico Steph and chi1 made ctf6
22:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> chi1 made some maps i know yes
22:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> found some commits
22:27 <@Dune> cool
22:27 <@Dune> thanks for your work fisi
