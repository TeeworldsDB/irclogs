00:45 < laxa> Good news, I successfully merged from ddnet few commits into really old ddrace, maybe those my commits could be merged into DDRace
00:45 < laxa> I probably fucked up some things since I have some warnings
00:45 < laxa> Here is the repo, last 2 commits are the one to adapt to vanilla
00:45 < laxa> https://github.com/Laxa/teeworlds/commits/DDRace
00:54 < laxa> They fix the flooding issue
01:07 <@matricks> should do a proper fix :/
01:07 <@matricks> also, why did it add md5 and not use it?
01:13 < laxa> I kind of merged code that I didnt wrote, it's dirty and I fucked up merging some things probably, but it actually works, it's up to you to clean the merges I did
01:23 < laxa> I'll probably try to do a cleaner fix this week-end, gotta go sleep now
01:23 < laxa> I'll probably also fix zatch, inq and fastrace servers if I can find the repositories
01:24 < laxa> Funny thing, the merge I made works with password protected servers, this is not the case for ddnet
01:33 < burt> matricks: I agree, it should at least wait until the player is in the game or spectating before considering it a "player" that is connected 
01:37 <@matricks> yeah, I think it was tribes that had a cool system for fighting ddos attacks
01:39 <@matricks> first you do the antispoof, and when some one connects, they have to solve a problem, the more times the connect etc, the harder the problem becomes, effectivly burning cpu cycles on the attacker machines
01:40 <@heinrich5991> what kind of challenge do you have in mind? would computing an sha256 below a certain threshold fit?
01:40 <@matricks> dunno what they did :P
