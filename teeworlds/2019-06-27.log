09:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh yea! I implemented that for ddnet and i love to use it :) Its so peacefull you can keep playing with funvoters.
09:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But Assa do you think it should be a admin feature? Or also a user vote?
10:36 < rand> an admin feature, as kick/ban, you can vote for :3
12:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea that would mean a new tab in the vote menu. There is kick/spec/voteban/custom. Or we would allow custom votes to take player parameters o.O
12:16 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Just make a general "mute" command that disables chat and voting
13:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> That would be very bad @Dune . Taking the ability for people ot explain them selfs after they get vote banned is mean. The nice thing about removing vote power is that it is very harmless and people can still fully enjoy the game expirience and keep talking. Especially when there is some heavy discussions and funvotes a admin wants everybody invloved to stop voting and then liste <message clipped>
13:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Some people are spammy, would be nice to have other options than kick
13:35 < Assa> Hi ^.^,
13:36 < Assa> for the MapGenerator i moved backend_sdl and graphics_threaded.* to the shared folder - now i  can't compile anymore, because it doesn't find SDL.h
13:36 < Assa> any ideas what i need to do to fix it?
13:36 < Assa> This applies to both: client and server
14:28 < Assa> I needed to switch from #include "SDL.h" to #include "SDL/SDL.h"
14:28 < Assa> I don't know why, but it compiles now ...
14:31 < Assa> even SLD2/SDL.h works, i seem to have both installed on my computer
15:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune there is mute. But no reason to combin eit with something else.
15:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> There is mute?
15:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes clientside
15:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> would be an idea to implement it serverside too but not combined with something else pls :c
15:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune do both: an admin mute (for player spam) and an admin ban player from voting command
15:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe having one vote tab on the client side would be better, where you can select what you vote another player for
15:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I'm talking about server side mute.
15:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Don't complexify the UI for that
16:38 < day> im still confused about the new serverlist filter ui
16:39 < day> the old one was plain better :P
16:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> day: agree
16:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Assa: that likely only works on your computer
16:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you'd likely need to adjust some include directory handling for the server in bam.lua and CMakeLists.txt
16:58 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Assa it's unlikely you need support for rendering in the server though, why did you move it?
17:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @heinrich5991 can you tell me where i need to adjust it? I already edited them a lot
17:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> and I need them for map generation: Loading Embedded Images and saving them requires IGraphics
17:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> As LordSK pointed out, its probably an overkill
