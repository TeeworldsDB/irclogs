06:54 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> tried out the new teeworlds in devuan ceres.  wtf, no point for picking up a flag anymore?!
08:19 < rand> that has been fixed for the next release
08:57 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> o yup, i see, that's just 0.7.0-1 in ceres repo.
12:07 < Dune> hey rand
12:12 < Dune> I think having a console opening and closing is a bit ugly but maybe it is worth the sacrifice to get it to be a console option
12:12 < Dune> idk
12:34 < rand> I think it's ugly
12:35 < Dune> pretty sure we're going to get a crowd of angry people at release over that :D
12:36 < rand> but I don't want to ignore ChillerDragon point
12:37 < rand> yeah, still, it's also about either packaging or adding a option in the shortcut
12:37 < Dune> packaging?
12:38 < rand> in linux distribution
12:38 < rand> nvm
12:38 < Dune> sorry, I don't follow you
12:38 < rand> it's a windows issue
12:38 < Dune> yes
12:38 < rand> forget what i said about packaging ^^
12:38 < Dune> it would be a bit weird to have a cl_console option that does nothing under linux/mac right
12:39 < rand> hm, it can be in a #ifdef ...WINDOW scope
12:39 < Dune> right
12:40 < Dune> I wonder why code snippets are no longer working for me but they work for you >:(
12:40 < rand> which snippets ?
12:41 < Dune> code snippets on github
12:41 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1565#issuecomment-434723822
12:41 < Dune> broken all over there for some reason
12:46 < Dune> why is the dynamic camera in "general" and not "controls"
12:46 < Dune> took me forever to find it
14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> hi
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hey
15:09 < rand> it doesn't work for me anymore :x
15:09 < Dune> what doesn't?
15:09 < Dune> ah ,snippets
15:12 < rand> yes, even on previous messages
15:12 < rand> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1580#discussion_r229099219
15:12 < rand> it worked iirc
15:12 < Dune> must be a microsoft conspiracy
15:13 < rand> sure
20:38 < Dune> yeay, favorites are back in the serverlist, rand :)
20:38 < Dune> thx
