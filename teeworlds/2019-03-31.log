12:30 <@Dune> time to test the latest bind system :)
12:30 < Oy> there is one issue though
12:31 <@Dune> huh :c
12:31 < Oy> having an action on a composed bind and the releasing the modifier
12:31 < Oy> action is still active
12:31 <@Dune> first thing I test doesn't work :<
12:31 < Oy> ?
12:31 <@Dune> shift+1 to join a team
12:32 < Oy> cause shift is already taken
12:32 < Oy> bound
12:32 <@Dune> ahh
12:32 < Oy> to spec/emote selctor
12:32 <@Dune> unbound both shifts, still doesn't work
12:33 <@Dune> ah nvm
12:33 <@Dune> teams full this time :D
12:33 < Oy> :P
12:33 < Oy> tested it with ctrl
12:34 <@Dune> releasing the modifier shouldn't stop the action imo
12:35 < Oy> hm
12:36 < Oy> should releasing the key do it?
12:36 < Oy> right now, u have to press the modifier again and then release the key to stop it
12:36 <@Dune> releasing the key should yeah
12:37 <@Dune> when I'm in a text editor and I hold down ctrl-z, it rewinds
12:37 <@Dune> if I release ctrl, it keeps going
12:37 <@Dune> if I release z it stops
12:37 <@Dune> having to press the modifier again is an issue, yeah
12:39 < Oy> yeah, will do it that way
13:31 <@Dune> works for me :)
13:32 <@Dune> finally #1827 is out of sight :p
13:33 <@Dune> still haven't found a solution to the settings for the advanced scoreboard
13:33 <@Dune> If need be I could have it in a popup, a scrollable area, etc, but I don't see where I would put anything like that :|
13:37 < Oy> settings ->general->client
13:39 < Oy> popup might be best?
14:34 <@Dune> this general tab gets bloated :(
14:35 <@Dune> the general tab looks at the sound tab in envy :P
14:53 < rand> about instagib, it is usually with laser, but has a version with grenade also existed ?
14:53 < rand> maybe a config option
15:07 <@Dune> yeah, it was gctf
15:08 <@Dune> and the "zcatch" 0.7 servers are grenade instagib too
15:13 < rand> but, people tend to release players they killed, making this look like gDM
15:14 <@Dune> yeah
15:15 <@Dune> there were gctf servers in 0.6 back when I played there
15:15 <@Dune> I think gctf gameplay is very map independent, if the map isn't appropriate it's crappy
15:19 < rand> oh, there was a gCTF tournament few weeks ago :o
15:29 < Oy> don't need to list all the settings for advanced scoreboard there, could show that in a popup
15:29 <@Dune> right, make client two-columned then
15:29 < Oy> about the console: when there's a config for it we don't need the start params anymore right?
15:29 <@Dune> I was thinking about that
15:30 <@Dune> we might want to keep backwards compatibility
15:30 <@Dune> that's not too important
15:42 < rand> oh, gDM/gCTF do not use infinite ammo :o
15:42 <@Dune> huh, there are pickups?
15:43 < rand> no, auto reload, well it may depends on the server in fact
15:44 < rand> auto reload like pistol
15:44 < rand> I didn't play, so I don't have many reference...
16:07 < rand> wow, juste merge ginsta to 0.7, and it looks fine (with  few edit)
16:14 <@Dune> rand, makes sense, grenade spam sucks
16:15 <@Dune> I wonder what that quick edit mode is btw, must have missed when it was added
16:17 <@Dune> I'll have a look into the warmup code
16:18 <@Dune> sv_warmup -1/0/x can't be too hard to implement, right
16:18 <@Dune> just need to keep it for survival
16:18 < Oy> you can mark&copy text from the console
16:18 <@Dune> is that a win10 thing?
16:18 <@Dune> I can copy the console on win7 just fine
16:19 < Oy> should be possible on win7 too yeah
16:41 <@Dune> okay, it's a bad idea to change the windows console background color to blue
16:42 <@Dune> it's the second time I thought I had a BSOD for a moment
16:44 < Oy> :P
17:44 < Oy> these format specifier warnings are annoying :(
17:46 <@Dune> yeah they are
17:57 < Oy> rand: can i assign u to this https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1966 ? :)
18:14 <@Dune> trying to debug why the bot skin looks like https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/507109456631431168/560857838658912276/55173431-fed96c80-517b-11e9-9451-90002822f917.png
18:22  * rand starts running
18:23 < rand> I'll give time to it later (weeks/month) so you can :)
18:27 < Oy> ok, done :)
18:28 < Oy> Dune: probably have to be fixed in the file
18:28 < Oy> had similar problems with the santa hats
18:28 < Oy> when mirroring (looking left/right)
18:31 <@Dune> okay, that's what I feared. hopefully @zatline can adjust that :|
18:56 <@Dune> but it's difficult to get exact values, right? 
19:58 <@Dune> Oy, sv_warmup -1 is for player-ready mode
19:58 <@Dune> do I use -2 for "no warmup"?
19:58 <@Dune> not sure if it's consistent
20:03 <@Dune> this is all very confusing :/
20:52 < Oy> hm isn't 0 no warmup?
20:52 < Oy> Dune: 
20:53 < Oy> that stuff got kinda complicated :)
20:56 <@Dune> -1 use the player ready mode when sv_player_ready_mode 1 is set
20:56 <@Dune> 0 disabled - only use the Game starts timer
20:56 <@Dune> otherwise use the Warmup timer with the given value, followed by the Game starts timer
20:57 <@Dune> so it would be best to just change 0 to display no warmups at all
20:58 < Oy> could do a seperate command for the game start timer
20:58 < Oy> like game countdown
20:59 <@Dune> hmm
20:59 <@Dune> i don't know if that's necessary though
21:00 < Oy> warmup is sth else than the game countdown
21:01 <@Dune> https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/commit/7d3f791e4ad6183f716ff6db92504dde7b888e36 would be nice already
21:03 <@Dune> it gets rid of the training phase on sv_warmup 0
21:09 < Oy> hm still useful for survival
21:15 <@Dune> those timers give me a headache
21:15 < Oy> yeah :)
21:15 <@Dune> there should be a scripting languages for automaton state programming
21:15 <@Dune> there probably is already and I just don't know about it :P
21:15 < Oy> :P
21:17 < Oy> about the ai player parts: there's probably some issue with the rendering somehow - should be looked into deeper when there's time :)
21:17 <@Dune> right :/ 
21:18 < Oy> didn't feel logical when i did the santa hats back then - there was some odd pixel offset
21:19 <@Dune> alright :)
