09:54 < ChillerDragon> my server is solid also the minecraft server is empty but i can get a dump
12:03 < ChillerDragon> ah I just realized the dump would contain sensible user data or can i use the berkley filter to just capture master traffic?
12:04 < ChillerDragon> ah ye probably a destination filter 
12:11 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/LI
12:12 < ChillerDragon> "bad udp cksum" thats probably already bad i guess
12:12 < ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut
12:15 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/9h
12:18 < ChillerDragon> ah nvm the vanilla server also sends a bad checksum
12:20 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 do you have some tcpdumps I should run? So far I do not see a big difference to the vanilla server
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> That one is hard to reproduce. Tried on ddnet7 with 32 clients, high bandwidth, forced full snapshots (~0.6MBit/s per client), 32 rcon commands per packet, several thousand votes and simulated packet loss... but I'm still registered to the masterserver
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> However, at the end the server crashed with `errornous client id` =\
15:07 < ChillerDragon> errornous client id is such a classic biggest annoyance in 0.7 based servers
17:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @redix put it in gdb if you can crash the server
17:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Couldn't reproduce it yet. I'll try again later.
17:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon `tcpdump -i <INTERFACE> -w dump.cap udp port 8303`
17:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> and then send me the dump.cap
19:30 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 that would contain plaintext credentials
19:30 < ChillerDragon> I mean I trust you and all and I would send you my passwords but its user data I do not feel comfortable sending that to anyone
19:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Just capture masterserver traffic?
19:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It's that part of the protocol failing to recover
20:25 < ChillerDragon> yea thats what im asking what kind of filter do you think is good?
20:25 < ChillerDragon> I used 'src port 7303 and dst master1.teeworlds.com or dst master2.teeworlds.com or dst master3.teeworlds.com'
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> `dst port 8283 || src port 8283 || src port 8284` ?
20:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I guess it's not the only server running there, so maybe && each case with the port of this specific server
21:38 < ChillerDragon> there is only 1 src port 
22:22 < Learath2> When the masterserver responds it'll have src port 8283 or 8284
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: would be nicer if it would be everything. you could not capture while you log into rcon
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but it's fine that way too, I guess
