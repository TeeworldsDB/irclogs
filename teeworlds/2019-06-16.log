00:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> datasrc/network.py playerflag thingy
00:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the one that is used for chatting etc and gets sent to every player
00:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon it probably gets ordered in a way that you do not expect by the code generation
00:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> meaning that you send "chatting" when you aren't chatting
00:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> so you can't move
00:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i appended to the end
00:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> like people did it in 0.6 or did the order get inverted?
00:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't know how the code is generated, but there is probably no alphabetical guarantee
00:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> maybe it changes with the compiler, maybe it's not even deterministic, I wouldn't rely on that
00:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i thought it depends on the index of the array
09:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> @ChillerDragon Removing the weak hook is not game breaking but mere a bug. It is server sided (iirc) and will work for all clients whatever 0.7 version client they use.
09:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Btw. modifying existing NetMsg could be risky. What are you trying to achieve? Why don't you define your own NetMsg? That is at least what ghost did for the Streamer mod, to send the characters health to the streamer clients.

11:14 < Dune> Morning
11:15 < Oy> hey
11:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Slayer *gV* trying to add h-client/ddnet aimline that is seen by others
11:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh and it is changing the game mechanics i would call that breaking
11:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I dont want to join one server and have differnt physics than on a other server
11:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> hi
11:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> just noticed some bugs
11:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> features
11:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> aborting restart (restart 0) automatically inits game starts counter and resets round
11:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh you should be able to abort restart?
11:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah, warmup 30s f.e.
11:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> u type in restart 0 and it cancels it
11:36 < Oy> isn't that a good thing?
11:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> well if somebody accidentaly starts a restart vote during a game and u want to abort it
11:37 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> it doesnt abort but isntead resets game
11:37 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i mean starts a new one
11:38 < Oy> hm, you can't abort a restart countdown
11:38 < Oy> it already left the game state
11:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> you could
11:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> at least some time ago
11:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> its even written in the command description
11:39 < Oy> hm
11:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> then its bug
11:39 < Oy> it shouldn't be possible
11:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> "Restart in x seconds ( 0 = abort)"
11:39 < Oy> different game state
11:39 < Oy> doesn't know the old game timer anymore
11:40 < Oy> yeah, i guess it restarted instantly back then too?
11:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah it removes warmup text and thats all
11:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> now it inits "Game starts in 3 2  1" and resets scores and all
11:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> starts a new round, which shouldnt
11:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> the correct function should just cancel the restart/warmup countdown and no "game starts in" init
11:44 < Dune> restart 0 means "restart with no delay", it should just restart the game
11:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> thats "restart"
11:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> "restart 0" is used to abort it
11:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> "restart 10" restarts in 10 s
11:46 < Dune> looks a bit glitchy :P
11:46 < Dune> would you have a clue on https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12822, btw, Oy?
11:47 < Oy> but still the game timer information is gone. did it start at 0 again in the past?
11:48 < Oy> Dune: couldn't reproduce it. updating the sdl2 version like you suggested would be an option.
11:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> actually its the first time im playing with it
11:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> but in 0.6 it used to be the way i explained above
11:49 < Dune> he has SDL 2.0.8
11:49 < Oy> could also post the config used. maybe it's reproducible with some odd setting
11:49 < Oy> ok
11:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> ah also stats do not reset Dune ðŸ˜›
11:50 < Oy> Sonix could you open an issue on github? probably needs some thinking :)
11:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> sure Oy, I have one more regarding restart should i open a separate one for it
11:53 < Oy> yeah, probably best to do seperate ones
11:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> when u're alone in the server, restart votes restar game immediately independently from the seconds u typed in
11:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> f.e restart 40, restarts immediately
11:54 < Dune> warmups were a mistake :P
11:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> warmups are good, its the warmup + game timer combo thats wrong ðŸ˜›
11:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> or game starts countdown or whatever its called
12:05 < Oy> Dune: the user could also try sdl 2.0.9, might have been fixed there, though there's nothin in the changelog
12:37 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> does downloadable content mean loot boxes will happen too? ðŸ˜‰ lol
12:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> unlockable hats ðŸ˜®
12:39 < Oy> :D
12:39 < Oy> would be easy to provide a theme: christmas, halloween ...
12:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah, a lot of nice possibilities
12:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oy is there a public repo for the svg files?
12:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> not really
12:47 < Oy> ChillerDragon no, they're all in a dropbox folder. team members have  access to them
12:49 < Oy> though nobody can upload but zatline i think
12:49 < Oy> should probably improve that
12:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> why not public?
12:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> some artists might prefer to not have their source works public
12:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sad story ._.
12:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I thought we are an opensource game?
12:58 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> artists are not the game, its their right to choose wether to share their work or not
12:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> developers arent the game either
13:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> couldnt we use svgs as actual ressources for the game? To finally remov ethe pixels from the game :c
13:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> for example the sun on dm1 isnt sharp at all
13:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1564
13:01 < Oy> you'd need a total different rendering engine for that
13:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ya thought so .-.
13:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
13:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/589771832547082301/Unbenannt.PNG
13:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> look how crips the skin and gun i scompared to the supersize quad
13:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> crisp* .-.
13:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
13:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/589775565683163137/Unbenannt.PNG
13:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Hmm the markings allow for some weird combinations with the greensward skin
13:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> we could blur the borders of those fullbody markings at the end. So on a round tee the blur would be under the body border and on bigger tees it would remove sharp edges.
13:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> or just apply marking to full body, then mask using its body shape but thats future talks
13:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> o.O
13:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> thats the artist speaking.
13:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sounds great
13:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> its actually full square texture/pattern that when applied it adapts (mask) to the body skin
13:23 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> ^^
13:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah but the pngs in the client are masked already
13:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but you have the bigger texture somewhere in the private graphics repo i guess
13:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> dunno mine is just an idea
13:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> the actual markings are just based on the default tee
13:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> body
13:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Its perfect idea. And kinda important imo. Because many custom skins are a bigegr and different shape. The thing is most players probably want to see the popular custom skins but some people will put random markings on it and then you have to look at that .-.
13:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> but dunno how difficult is it to realize codewise
13:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> me neither i have no clue
13:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> as for graphic files nothing would change neither size nor file dimensions
13:37 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> omg how to use git -.-
13:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/DGI0z/ac710fa49b.png
13:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i synced with upstream but it still says im behind
13:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i have all commits from teewolrds/teeworlds tho
13:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> a quick example
13:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://i.imgur.com/PL8QShQ.png
13:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yy perfect
14:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Imo it is very annoying that you cant see the chat while being in menu .-. i hear the chat sound and i have to close the menu to see what is written even tho there is tons of space to display the messages
14:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also servermessages overlap if you are in scoreboard
14:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
14:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/589796245682257920/screenshot_2019-06-16_14-36-58.png
14:41 < Dune> I think that is an issue with TextWidth, not server messages in particular
14:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> look at the super long chate messages i wrote above
14:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> bewlo*
14:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> much wow english skills
14:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh wait i used long letters
14:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lets test with shorter ones
14:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> those also work
14:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
14:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/589796990326407172/screenshot_2019-06-16_14-42-29.png
14:43 < Oy> that overlapping was fixed already
14:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hmm weird i thougtht my tw is built from latest master
14:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but not 100% sure tho
14:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh wait or is it a serverside fix and the old server?
14:44 < Oy> no was client sided
14:46 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/934cd5a6cdf981d253d638d92773c7d58c40bdfe
14:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe reintroduced by https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/c5a928bd4c97b3205deeed7783a8dea06cc3aa6d
14:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but wait let me test a fresh build sec
14:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah yes seems like my build was outdated. weird tho
20:23 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Slayer *gV* the tutorial for cmake is in the github readme IIRC
21:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Is it only for me or a known issue that the menu loads super slow .-.
21:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> If i press esc ingame on a ctf server it says "(1)" a few seconds before it says "join blue" for example
21:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh waiiiit
21:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is it a delay feature?
21:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im so stupid xxd
21:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> haha yes looks like nvm sorri
