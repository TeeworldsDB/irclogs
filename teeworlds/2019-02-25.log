04:37 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> no one in normal gametypes anymore... :(  what's that ddrace bs?  did the new version scoop up fools?  ugh.  teeworlds is dead.  my addiction... i have to go cold turkey.
09:09 < day> Digit: ikr?
09:34 < rand> sad truth, don't give up!
09:55 < day> that being said im seeing more and more good players on 0.7
10:07 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> is 0.7 at all playable/enjoyable???  i had a quick glimpse, n it seemed like it was heading in the wrong direction in so many ways, like too zoomed in for one.
10:08 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> afaik 0.6 is no more and no less zoomed in than 0.7
10:17 < day> the menu is a step back imho. ingame i havent noticed much difference. also i could still swear tea collisions are much more severe/frequent
10:18 <@heinrich5991> I like the new menu
10:19 <@heinrich5991> if you want to go straight to the server browser on launch: I think we have an option for that
10:19 < day> yes thats possible
10:19 < day> but someone had the ingenious idea of removing the settings button from the server browser view :P
10:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It's still there
10:50 < day> the setting button in the upper right corner?
10:51 < day> it's there ingame. but not in the server browser
10:58 < minus> is there a good movement tutorial? esp. wrt hook
10:59 < minus> also how exactly hook physics work
11:01 < day> minus: occasionally you find a precious comment in the code :p
11:16 < rand> huhu
11:16 < rand> there is some tutorial by amarillo
11:19 < rand> like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErmocbgAgE8
11:59 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> :/  played idk how many games.  scored all the flags in most games, for both teams.  :/
13:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> minus what is a wrt hook?
13:14 < Edible> Digit: Don't badmouth ddrace, its the only thing keeping tw alive at this rate
13:16 < Edible> badmouthing vanilla defending ddrace, *shakes head*
13:16 < rand> ChillerDragon: "with respect to" ?
13:18 < rand> is teeworlds alive if vanilla is dead ?
13:20 < rand> ddrace is doing great, and vanilla is dying but has survived on its own until now
13:22 < rand> vanilla is not dead yet, it is still moving, no fire nor flamethrower will harm it
13:29 < rand> 180/240 players use 0.6 atm
13:31 < Edible> People are always bad mouthing good things here, ddrace brings in new players and vanilla feeds off of that, If you want to play on a specific match on vanilla then I suggest you do scheduled matches, I'd join a ML or some sort of notification service 
14:57 < rand> 0.6: 611 servers, 268 players
14:58 < rand> 0.7: 106 servres, 47 players
14:58 < rand> people have not migrated yet
16:27 < minus> Heresy
16:27 < minus> .7 is great
16:28 < minus> Tho i must say my mouse had terrible lag when i played earlier
16:43 < rand> probably because your speed is boyond human comprehension, then you fell like the mouse moves way later
16:43 < rand> that's not true
16:43 < rand> you are simply too fast
17:44 < minus> Or it's just X11 doing its thing
17:44 < minus> Or my wireless mouse
18:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Try inp_mousegrab 1
18:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> rand: because all the content is still on 0.6. New versions need to encourage content creators imo
18:58 < koomi> minus: I had mouse lag too, turned out to be sdl trying to exec dbus-launch (which didn't exist) on every event poll
19:35 < minus> >2 people in server
19:35 < minus> >get banned
19:35 < minus> nice
19:35 < rand> I bet that took 10s
19:35 < rand> poeple want to play alone sometimes :|
19:56 < minus> tfw i'm pretty good
20:46 < minus> just kidding, got owned badly
20:47 < minus> though i've improved a lot considering i've maybe played this for 2 hours in the last 5 year
20:48 < minus> okay probably a bit more than 2 hours
20:48 < minus> no mouse lag here at all fwiw, and also more than twice as many fps
20:48 < minus> praise the wayland overlords
22:44 <@Dune> day: I have the settings button in the browser too
