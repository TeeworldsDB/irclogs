00:40 < Learath2> I'm a little late, but I think you should drop either cmake or bam, maintaining two build systems is just unnecessary work
03:25 < eawo2k4> Heya
08:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Learath but bam is nice for macOS apps and cmake is famous tool for ppl coming from non tw projects
08:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I mean it’s not like there are too many changes so it’s unmaintainable. Sometimes it helps to have another possibility to build.
08:59 < Dune> Learath2: you mean with CD or in general?
09:00 < Dune> In general I agree that it's a lot of annoying work sometimes and there are unforeseen consequences of having to work with both because some project forks would only care about one
09:01 < Dune> Unfortunately cmake's popularity makes it really useful for package managers etc. and bam is still quite faster :/
09:21 < Dune> Of course everyone would rather everyone else get to use *their* build system :)
12:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Dune: in what way is bam faster?
12:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> have you tried using `-GNinja` during configure time (and having ninja installed)
12:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I'm not particularly attached to cmake, but I do think we should use *one* build system that is not just used by us
14:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Dune: does the settings comment '# Teeworlds 0.7.3' update if there is a new version?  Or is this planned?
14:41 < Dune> heinrich5991: I absolutely agree that there are large benefits to support a popular build system such as cmake, and I'm not advocating for it going away
14:51 < Dune> ChillerDragon: you can see what it does there: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2303/files
14:51 < Dune> Namely `		WriteLine("# Teeworlds " GAME_VERSION);` :)
14:56 < Dune> heinrich5991: here, make -j4 is 73.82s/22.8s. ninja is 71.20s/20.027s. bam is 36.5s/11.0s
15:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y i saw that i was just wondering if that version is planned to be changed
15:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Well yes it should change every release
17:42 < Learath2> huh, it's 13s for ninja, 32s with bam, 14s with make for me. that is in real time
17:43 < Learath2> even if it wasn't faster though, does it even matter? I still wouldn't maintain a second build system unless the difference is an order of magnitude higher
18:28 < Dune> Really? Strange, I did not tweak bam anyhow to achieve this and cleared all the files
18:33 < Dune> It has some other advantages such as being arguably simpler, not requiring to list all files, and a lot of legacy teeworlds build flow is built on it. 
18:33 < Dune> Now of course I am biased like everyone towards tools I am familiar with 
18:35 < Dune> Contrarily to cmake, bam does not require to be constantly updated, so I think the maintenance cost is significantly lower
18:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> Cmake also doesnt require to list all files, you can use globs, but its not recommended
19:05 < Learath2> I don't like cmake at all tbh, but it's used by everyone and their mothers and I don't like redundancy in build systems, so it's what I'd go for
19:05 < Learath2> But it's just a suggestion anyway, build system debates are always very subjective
22:32 < Dune> fair point
22:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> I would love something like maven for C++, but more KISS
22:45 < Dune> redix, would you want to have both white and black colored clocks?
