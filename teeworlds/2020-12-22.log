16:10 < ChillerDragon> is this a windows feature or did i get trolled?
16:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you should have asked more precisely and done a troubleshooting :'/
16:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe we would know.
22:09 < ChillerDragon> no chance @jxsl13 that guy rq 1 second after i wish i knew but he didnt seem like having the intention to update explain or help debugging

22:13 < ChillerDragon> i could swear i asked already but i coudlnt find it in the logs :/
22:15 < ChillerDragon> can we get a --version or -v to print the server and client version and exit?
22:15 < ChillerDragon> or does anyone think thats somehow usless / bad?
22:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> one day he will update.
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> one day. Hopefully not in 2077
22:30 < ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 arent u big with configs? xd
22:31 < ChillerDragon> i just wondered that the server loaded my ~/.teeworlds/autoexec.cfg instead of the ./autoexec.cfg shouldnt current dir be loaded because it is more specific?
22:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> check the beginning of the server output
22:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it has the priority
22:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> check your storage.cfg within the same folder as your executable, I guess
