00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @redix I started one on heinrich5991.de, can you check whether that one works?
00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @heinrich5991 yeah that one responds ðŸ™‚
00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so it's the server, not the code
00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> porbably
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> when you skip the serverbrowser you don't see the message
00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> it's only visible in the main menu
00:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> we should have some really annoying popup for that
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think a discreet note is fine
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> everyone playing on an old version is going to see it every time they join
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> not when the option for skipping the main menu is enabled
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> which is a console only option IIRC?
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> nope, it's in the general tab in settings
00:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm ok
00:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but still disagree on "annoying popup"
00:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> well many people are just too lazy too upgrade and this might be a bit more "motivating"
00:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> but yeah, it's probably too much...
01:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't think an annoying popup will bring us more good than wrath, but it's true the message should be in the server browser as well in case people have the skip-main-menu option checked
10:52 < ChillerDragon> oof seems like somewhere in the last commits there was something that impacted mouse speed :/
10:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Bisect for it
10:58 < ChillerDragon> ye nvm seems like its a bug happend during merge w my custom client 
10:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> ha
11:07 < ChillerDragon> fml im too lazy to debug this crap its probably some merge fail with the new controler code ._.
11:07 < ChillerDragon> @Dune did you have any problems with merging gamer?
11:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> With master? Yeah think so
