14:11 <@heinrich5991> does anyone have access to a freebsd machine? I'd like to know whether -lGL -lGLU -lX11 (without any -L) works there (and probably find out the reason why it doesn't)

17:27 < Assa> hey dune, as next feature i want to do the hover text - how do i get the mouse x/y?
17:36 < Dune> hey Assa, I don't think you need to know that
17:36 < Dune> what do you mean by "hover text", you mean tips?
18:06 < Assa> yeah, show settings tips, if your mouse is over the setting
18:06 < Assa> this is only possible if there is a function that knows the bounding box and the mouse position
18:07 < Assa> I see you already have that ^.^
18:07 < Dune> you don't need to get the raw mouse x/y though, look how it's done in the server browser and other Button logic functions

20:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Oy, not sure if you're here or not, I posted on the forum about the editor
20:19 < Oy> LordSk ok, will try to take a look
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> there is no rush, I'm just notifying you üòÉ
21:10 < Oy> LordSk looks good so far, great job :)
21:10 < Oy> will test it when i have more time and provide some feedback
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Is there a way to render text with a max width and an alignement?
22:12 < Dune> you should take a look at Assa's last PR, he does that
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I cant see any align
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I want to use ALIGN_CENTER
22:32 < Dune> @Fudgy so I just had a look at the function that does the aligning usually
22:32 < Dune> DoLabel is in ui.cpp
22:32 < Dune> 	switch(Align)
22:32 < Dune> 	{
22:32 < Dune> 	case ALIGN_CENTER:
22:32 < Dune> 	{
22:32 < Dune> 		float tw = TextRender()->TextWidth(0, Size, pText, -1, LineWidth);
22:32 < Dune> 		TextRender()->Text(0, r->x + r->w/2-tw/2, r->y - Size/10, Size, pText, LineWidth, MultiLine);
22:32 < Dune> 		break;
22:33 < Dune> so it's just a call to TextWidth and then to Text
22:33 < Dune> dolabel has a LineWidth parameter anyway can't you use that?
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I knew I could just do "r->x + r->w/2-tw/2" but I was wondering if there was a funciton somewhere for it already
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Im using Cursor
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> But it doesnt take an alignement
22:35 < Dune> so you can't use DoLabel directly?
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I know about textwidth
22:35 < Dune> well if you already know how to do it, say it in the question :P
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> DoLabel doesnt have a max width no?
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Well
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> it has but
22:35 < Dune> "float LineWidth"
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> it just switched to the next line
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I want TEXTFLAG_STOP_AT_END
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> or an equivalent
22:36 < Dune> what if you remove MultiLine?
22:36 < Dune> void CUI::DoLabel(const CUIRect *r, const char *pText, float Size, EAlignment Align, float LineWidth, bool MultiLine)
22:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> didnt try wait
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> ok thats what I wanted üëç
