11:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oy: how do you navigate in the terminal? Am I the only person who constantly uncounsciously attempts ctrl-a/e/k/u in tw consoles?
11:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> If my brain sees something terminal like it trys these and it works everywhere except in tw :c
11:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> If the only way to get this feature is also allowing in in all other chat buffers that would be okay but i dont think these shortcuts fit there
13:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is coany in this channel?
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Do we still have something like the old Global Sound?
16:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> can I somehow create a sound only for onr player?
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ` -- Looking for WavpackOpenFileInputEx - not found` AppVeyor, does anyone know how to fix that properly Oo?
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's not a problem
16:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's just feature detection which version of `WavpackOpenFileInputEx`
16:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> do you know, how to read the error logs, in AppVeyor?
16:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> *that's just feature detection testing which version of wavpack is in use
16:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 link?
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> where can I find a sharing link for that Oo?
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm rather new to this
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ok, where's your repo?
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jxsl13/zcatch
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe this?
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> `git clone -q --branch=zCatch-0.7.x https://github.com/jxsl13/zcatch.git`
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> branch is not he master one
17:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> please ignore the policy errors x)
17:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what do you mean, policy errors?
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> they seem to be the problem
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Oo
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> works fine on debian
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's cause the libraries didn't set any version
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> `cmake -Werror=dev`
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you're requesting warnings to be treated as errors
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (this is usually a good thing for CI, so you don't introduce new warnings)
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it would probably be best if you'd fix the warnings instead of hide them, but that's the reason it works for you but not on appveyore
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> -e
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well,  I'm not developing the libriries,  do you know whether it's possible to suppress those warnings only for those sub-projects?
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> libraries*
17:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but they're in your src/engine/external, so you could apply a fix to them
17:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there are external submodules
17:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> git submodules
17:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't know how to do this
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok, thanks anyway for the -Werror=dev part
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> `git checkout zCatch-0.7.x` this probably shouldn't be in there
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok
17:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> rip cmake.
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm?
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jxsl13/zcatch/branch/zCatch-0.7.x
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> oh man, should learn to read, I guess
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 Can I create global sounds serverside? If not, what would be the best workaround? Maybe sending the sound to every client on each position? Would I need to use ClientID for Mask in that case?
19:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or, 1LL << ClientID?
21:20 < JesseH> Are the assets in datasrc/skins under a different license?
21:21 < JesseH> I'm working on a project inspired by Teeworlds and was wondering what limitations may exist in using the graphics/assets.
22:17 < JesseH> I need to get a real client.
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Afaik its free to use
