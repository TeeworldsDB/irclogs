14:25 <@heinrich5991> what does a double comma do in javascript? [1,, 3]?
14:31 <@matricks> it's not a double comma
14:31 <@matricks> it's two single commands
14:31 <@matricks> you will have an entry that isn't anything
14:31 <@matricks> because JS
14:35 <@heinrich5991> so I probably have an array with only indices 0 and 2?
15:28 <@minus> index 1 will be undefined iirc
