14:07 < BotoX> Wasn't there someone in here who was running a bunch of TF2 instances on a server?
14:07 <@minus> BotoX: chsk
14:12 < BotoX> god damnit, I use -textmode in the launch options, it works on my local PC but it starts the full game when I do it on my server in VNC
14:12 < BotoX> and yeah, that's not really good: https://i.botox.bz/1407240754.png
14:16 <@minus> talk to the chsk
14:16 < BotoX> ya, you already highlighted him, now we wait D:
14:23 <@minus> i could hilight chsk again
14:24 < BotoX> I got it running without starting a window with: -textmode -nosound -nopix -novid -nopreload -sw
14:24 <@matricks> o/
14:24 < BotoX> But it's still using 450% CPU
14:24 < BotoX> so eh, not quite there yet
14:24 <@minus> that's normal i think
14:24 <@minus> hello matricius
14:24 < BotoX> I don't think it did that on my PC
14:25 < BotoX> oh wait what lol, I joined a server and it stopped
14:26 < BotoX> neat
14:29 <@matricks> minus: hellu
15:36 < chsk> woot
15:36 < chsk> BotoX: -textmode is kill, a patch from last year made it so you don't get drops with it
15:45 < chsk> additionally native linux performance is awful at best
15:45 <@minus> chsk: you're using a proxy opengl library that just does nothing?
15:46 < chsk> i'm just using llvmpipe
15:46 < chsk> but i managed to run the game with -noshaderapi, which kills off any rendering
