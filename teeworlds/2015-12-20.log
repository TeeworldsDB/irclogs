00:18 <@matricks> heinrich5991: http master?
00:19 <@heinrich5991> yes. except for checking the port forwarding
00:19 <@matricks> reasons?
00:20 <@heinrich5991> makes it immune against ddos attacks, because you can deploy a http proxy that hides the actual master
00:20 <@matricks> heinrich5991: fair enough
00:20 <@matricks> heinrich5991: write new master in... RUST!
00:20 <@matricks> \ :D
00:21 < Edible> good god
00:22 <@matricks> btw, just saw that new star wars movie
00:22 < Edible> aaaand
00:22 < Edible>  /ignore matricks
00:22 <@matricks> :) I liked it
00:22 < Edible> :)
00:22 < Edible> phew
00:22 < Edible> ok :)
00:22 <@matricks> not gonna spoil anything
00:22  * Edible leaves channel asap
00:23 <@matricks> got me thinking, in ep 1-6, who is the strongest user of the force?
00:28 < loler> Hey
00:30 <@heinrich5991> bye!
00:31 < Edible> oh!
00:31 < Edible> well, the sith lord
00:31 < Edible> and darth vader
00:31 < Edible> we never saw anyone from the light side actually doing anything powerfull at all
00:32 <@matricks> Edible: how about obi-wan?
00:32 <@matricks> Edible: I mean, the guy could just dissappear if he wanted to
00:32 < Edible> jedi mind trick? i think a lot of people did that
00:33 <@matricks> mind trick many could do, but never seen anyone else just disappear
00:33 < Edible> mm when did he disappear?
00:33 < Edible> when he died?
00:33 <@matricks> Edible: when vader struck him in ep4
00:33 <@matricks> "died", he just disappeared
00:34 < Edible> but he couldnt return to human form
00:34 < Edible> he just spoke to luke either
00:34 < Edible> so he just became one with the force
00:34 < Edible> which anakin did as well (and yoda)
00:34 < Edible> so i think jedi's become one with the force
00:35 < Edible> although i've never really thought about it
00:47 <@heinrich5991> minus: I feel dirty: https://github.com/heinrich5991/adventofcode-2015/blob/master/12/1.py
00:47 <@heinrich5991> :D
00:48 <@heinrich5991> ah, second question requires me to actually parse the json
01:45 <@matricks> blargh, don't like it when I need todo windows dev on bam :/
08:17 <@minus> heinrich5991: hehe, had a similar issue
08:18 <@minus> heinrich5991: i used json.load's parse_int hook
15:46 <@heinrich5991> minus: my na√Øve approaches to 19/2 are of sufficiently exponential nature that it doesn't work. do I need to implement a full-blown word algorithm for context-free grammars?
15:49  * matricks is optimizing bam
15:49 <@matricks> and microsoft is retarded as usual
15:49 <@heinrich5991> what's the issue?
15:49 <@matricks> well, first I battled with CreateProcess with redirected stdin and out
15:50 <@matricks> took a while before I figured out that microsofts own example was broken
15:50 <@matricks> and then comes microsofts broken way of parsing command lines
15:52 <@matricks> something that took me 5 minutes to get working in linux is taking more a couple of hours under windows
15:52 <@matricks> but it seems like it starting to work
15:53 <@matricks> and now it's workin
15:53 <@heinrich5991> the problem is probably that windows doesn't really have a concept of multiple parameters, it just has a single command line string
15:53 <@matricks> well, it's not only that
15:53 <@matricks> spaces in command lines is a bit, special
15:53 <@matricks> and the parsing is actually broken
15:54 <@matricks> if you pass this: command "sadf asdf" "sadf sadf"
15:54 <@matricks> it will give you this
15:54 <@matricks> command sadf asdf" "sadf sadf
15:54 <@matricks> it remove the first and last quotes
15:54 <@matricks> because windows
15:55 <@matricks> and then.. AND THEN
15:55 <@matricks> you have visual c++
15:55 <@matricks> which always tells you which file its compiling, so it ruins the build systesm nice output
15:55 <@matricks> so you have to special case for that and handle that
15:56 <@matricks> BUT WAIT, THERE IS MORE!
15:56 <@matricks> because if you launch from inside visual studio, cl doesn't write output to stdout
15:56 <@matricks> because they wanna support unicode so they set an environment variable that points to a pipe that cl will check for and open and send all output there instead
15:57 <@matricks> oh, but there is EVEN MORE!
15:57 <@matricks> if you are canceling a build, there is like 3 different cases that can happen, one of which is that msvc will kill the build system and a set of random processes that it spawned
15:58 <@matricks> leaving processes behind
16:00 <@heinrich5991> sounds fun
16:00 <@heinrich5991> regarding one of the thing: you could use GetCommandLine to get the actual command line and parse it yourself: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683156%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
16:00 <@heinrich5991> *things
16:01 <@matricks> nonono
16:02 <@matricks> this is a parameter passed to CreateProcess..
16:20 <@minus> heinrich5991: i'm still at 15
16:20 <@minus> other things to do right now
19:35 < Aerocell> Teeworlds 0.7 release date is still 24th december 2015?
19:36 <@matricks> there is a datE?
19:38 < ImYFU> ^Told on forum
19:38 <@matricks> where?
19:38 < ImYFU> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11525
19:39 <@matricks> lol
19:40 <@matricks> yeah, don't think that will happen :)
19:41 <@minus> replied
19:42 <@matricks> btw, HL3 is coming out next year
19:42 < ImYFU> yeah, already pre-ordered
19:42 <@matricks> I should be wearing pants for this
19:48 <@heinrich5991> minus: it seems no one understood why I put quotes around "minus announced on irc"
19:49 < ImYFU> you should use blue color
19:49 < ImYFU> it's official forum sarcasm color
19:57 <@matricks> wow, sarcasm, thats original
20:01 < ImYFU> Hey, we didn't invent a joke color yet
20:01 < ImYFU> Working with the little we have
20:42 <@heinrich5991> anyone here doing adventofcode and can give me a hint for day 19 part 2?
20:43 < Kirbs> whew, I was worried that 0.7 was going to be released before it was ready
