00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> btw
00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> is it bad to increase the server buffer?
00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i want to send more msgs at the same time
00:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and what is NET_CONN_BUFFERSIZE?
00:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> is it in MB?
00:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 1024*32
00:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut it's in bytes
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> know you can program for teeworlds without ever kompiling it, because the pipeline does it for you xD
00:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lol true
00:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's actually nice 🙂
00:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I would have loved it back in high school writing .txt files on the library's computer and compiling home :)
00:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> if i want an empty command i just send an empty string, right?
00:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i mean empty by arguments
00:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
00:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> empty commands do get added too, but that doesnt help xd
00:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> well it literally does `help`
00:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> `AddCommand("help", "", "show help", ComHelp);`
00:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> second argument is empty (what i wanted)
01:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
01:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i meant the command
01:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> "help" in this case
01:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you could hide eastereggs behind empty commands
01:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> dont think so
01:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> not with this system, with normal chat yes
01:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> zcatch uses SendMessage in SendMessageText to set proper linebreaks for long text messages. basically splits long text into multiple SendMessage calls. if that's what Assa means.
01:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> wtf, @redix is this the download error you talked about?
01:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/AssassinTee/catch64/runs/376595487
01:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @𝓔𝓼𝓼𝓲𝓰𝓪𝓾𝓽𝓸𝓶𝓪𝓽 yes. Merge this commit:
01:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/9313b914d229e3a1896857dfe10f0dae8befceef
01:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> thank you
01:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i fucked up a merge step
01:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> happens 😄
01:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I merged Hotfix and Netflix to Hotflix
01:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> got an idea for a streaming service right there <.<
01:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I like how i updated catch64 just to notice, that there aren't any servers anymore :C
07:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Thx redix now I can compile with my fked up python setup without modifying bam.lua each time
07:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Now I only have to comment the code that prevents crosscompilation xd
11:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @redix `E: Failed to fetch https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azure-cli/dists/bionic/main/binary-amd64/Packages.bz2  File has unexpected size (7745 != 7578). Mirror sync in progress? [IP: 40.76.35.62 443]` :(
11:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> something doesnt work again
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Now it works again
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so weird
13:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Hey, I have a color code string `const char *pColor = "^xxx"`, can i initialize this const char* with a variable that only contains the three numbers and the `^` gets applied automatically, or do i need to use a normal char then and format it?
18:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> What? GitHub actions is not free?
18:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> at least not unlimited
18:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oh, private repositories ^^
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> it's free for open source
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ye
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> just saw that
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> since everything I do is open source ... 😄
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nice
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what happens if i reach my minutes
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in private
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> pay
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nah
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it will just stop for the month, right?
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i mean either pay or it won't run, simple?
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ok
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe microsoft is generous
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> since their service isn't even close to a load
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *currently
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> lmao i got an email saying i used 100% of github actions and now its still building xd
19:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ah well
19:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its not uploading the artifacts
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but can still check whether it builds xd
19:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2361#issuecomment-571721780
20:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> can commands have optional parameters?
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> like `/restart` and `/restart 42`
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> (second parameter `"i?"` ?
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> no
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> let's do adventure for tw chat
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> 🤪
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol
21:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> optional parameters best
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> lol, clients can send commands that aren't registered, interesting
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> if they do i know it's a custom client
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> On my server only 7 commanda are registered the rest isnt
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> there are like a lot
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> sneaky
