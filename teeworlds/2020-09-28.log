12:31 < bridge> [09:49:03] [teeworlds] <Learath2> Probably. Atleast if you do rework it, it should be much easier to do
12:31 < bridge> [09:50:09] [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> i mean chat/console history to be clear
12:31 < bridge> [09:56:52] [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yes
12:31 < ChillerDragon> [10:04:39] nice issue xd
12:31 < ChillerDragon> [10:04:43] @Dune
12:31 < bridge> [10:56:16] [teeworlds] <Learath2> histories don't have much to do with lineinput, does it?
12:31 < bridge> [10:56:27] [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> no. that's why i'm asking
12:31 < bridge> [10:56:49] [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> so i can think about how do I tackle this
12:31 < bridge> [10:57:46] [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> it'd be more jank if I just try to add selection to `chat.cpp`.
12:31 < bridge> [10:58:41] [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> if we don't actually need selection and copy in history, i can just focus on making a better lineinput
12:31 < bridge> [11:01:50] [teeworlds] <Learath2> Realistically, you probably want something along the lines of a `CTextContainer` which can be selectable or not and you want a `CLineInput` you can "attach" to a container to allow you to input in it
12:31 < bridge> [11:02:10] [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> make sense
12:31 < bridge> [11:06:31] [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> le engineering
12:31 < MalwareTele_> [11:17:03] hi
12:31 < MalwareTele_> [11:19:30] uh hi
