00:42 <@Dune> minus: hello
00:43 <@Dune> don't I need admin rights to edit stuff in /var/www for the teeworlds server?
00:43 <@Dune> every file seems to be in read-only
00:43 <@Dune> except master bans.cfg
00:44 <@Dune> ah, that is probably on purpose. can you just give g+w for docs.php?
00:46 <@Dune> I thought I had access to the docs, sry, didn't see the group :)
00:47 <@Dune> docs.php needs a if($wiki_page == "compiling_everything") $wiki_page = "hacking";
00:48 <@Dune> after what your PR can be merged, @Fisico
00:48 < Teeworlds> [documentation] Dune-jr pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fhLtS
00:48 < Teeworlds> documentation/master b8c2296 Jordy Ruiz: hacking.md: #teeworlds-dev no longer exists
00:54 < TeeSlayer> about zomb
00:54 < TeeSlayer> >This mod was first developed 3 years ago and is thus balanced for 16 players slots
00:55 < TeeSlayer> does this mean that I can make my own waves file and optimize it for more players?
00:55 < TeeSlayer> Ping LordSk (if you're here)
00:57 <@Dune> @LordSk
00:58 < TeeSlayer> oh discord right? :D
00:58 < TeeSlayer> well, for now there's a new zomb server for 4 players
00:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hey
00:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> that means the mod has 4 player slots hard-coded
00:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and 12 zombie "slots"
00:59 < TeeSlayer> okay
00:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> as they were only 16 slots back then
01:00 < TeeSlayer> @LordSk my zombie server is "loli#15 > Zombie"
01:00 < TeeSlayer> if you want to list it in your thread
01:01 < TeeSlayer> it appears to be working :)
01:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> alright thanks for hosting
01:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> there is a bug right now that I have fixed on my repo but not yet released
01:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> if you want to update early
01:02 < TeeSlayer> I compiled it on my own
01:02 < TeeSlayer> with the latest commit
01:02 <@Dune> that's not necessarily a good idea
01:02 <@Dune> there was a bit of an unstable version iirc
01:02 <@Dune> not sure if @LordSk pushed that
01:03 < TeeSlayer> what about cffc2e1499b1a79725688a18942d18888487ac ?
01:03 < TeeSlayer> >Fixed a few potential crashes
01:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> https://github.com/LordSk/teeworlds/commit/84c4d21a8334a59703905f8053c7900fdaa0c3dd
01:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I'll release an "hopefully stable now" version tomorrow ðŸ˜‰
01:05 < TeeSlayer> LordSk: that's the one I used
01:06 < minus> Dune: changed it
01:06 <@Dune> thanks minus :)
01:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok, let me know if you have any issues TeeSlayer
01:07 <@Dune> btw, the loli ictf) servers are rip? :(
01:08 < TeeSlayer> why rip?
01:08 < TeeSlayer> they work for me
01:08 <@Dune> I mean the ictf)
01:10 < TeeSlayer> yeah I switched to ivamp for instagib because somebody wanted to have kill awards
01:11 < TeeSlayer> I didn't use ) anyway
01:11 < TeeSlayer> s/use/enable
01:11 <@Dune> :( shields refresh the gameplay a lot
01:11 <@Dune> oh well
01:11  * TeeSlayer doesn't like it :D
01:12 < TeeSlayer> shields were disabled anyway when I used it
01:12 <@Dune> welp
01:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> the shield revolution has been slowed down on that day
01:14 <@Dune> first person I meet that straight up dislikes them :D
01:20 < Teeworlds> [documentation] Dune-jr pushed 12 new commits to master: https://git.io/fhLqi
01:20 < Teeworlds> documentation/master 5dc216f Fisico: added missing server commands
01:20 < Teeworlds> documentation/master 5df3e70 Fisico: splited compiling documentation for each OS
01:20 < Teeworlds> documentation/master 0844883 Fisico: added bam downloads
01:28 < TeeSlayer> lol wave 10
01:34 < TeeSlayer> Dune: probably because I don't use the Gamer client^^
01:35 <@Dune> the large majority of people don't
01:35 <@Dune> the mod wasn't made for the gamer client, I just made some cosmetics because I really like instashield :)
01:35 < TeeSlayer> it would be nice if users can also download skins & other graphics (such as the shield)
01:35 <@Dune> opens a lot of abuse unfortunately
01:35 <@Dune> it's @LordSk's mod though, unrelated to my client
01:35 < TeeSlayer> how do you mean?
01:36 <@Dune> it's probably quite heavy to do that properly
01:37 <@Dune> the images aren't so much the problem, you need code on how to use them
01:37 <@Dune> and executing code sent by the server is... well :D
01:37 < TeeSlayer> but skins should be possible, right?
01:37 <@Dune> that's much easier yes
01:38 < TeeSlayer> that would be better for mods such as zomb for example
01:38 <@Dune> it would, yeah
01:38 < TeeSlayer> I guess most players don't even know where to extract the skins etc.
01:38 <@Dune> yeah
01:38 <@Dune> but the server would have to handle that so it would be quite limited
01:38 <@Dune> you don't want clients to send any skin they like
01:42 < TeeSlayer> I meant it the other way: that the server can send skins to the clients
01:42 <@Dune> yeah, but that is limited
01:42 <@Dune> that was my point
01:42 <@Dune> you still can't see others skins, just the server bots
01:45 < TeeSlayer> hm
01:45 < TeeSlayer> well, anyway, somebody please port lightcatch and allow up to 64 players :-)
01:46 <@Dune> you should ask that publicly and link to the 0.6 mod with the sources ^^
01:53 < TeeSlayer> I'm wondering whether my server can even handle that many servers/players when full.
01:53 <@Dune> network is probably (?) the issue
01:54 < TeeSlayer> I had a Tor node with over 20 TB per month previously
01:54 < TeeSlayer> with that setup
01:54 < TeeSlayer> but it's probably the amount of connections
02:02 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr created gamer (+66 new commits): https://git.io/fhLmy
02:02 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/gamer 4aa74e3 Jordy Ruiz: Add gfx_game_tiles

02:02 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr deleted gamer at 81cb593: https://git.io/fhLm9
02:03 <@Dune> shit, mixed up the ssh addresses
02:04 <@Dune> you're probably right TeeSlayer, amount of connections gotta be a big deal with some 20 ish servers :x
02:10 < TeeSlayer> once teeworlds gets more players again and my servers really slow down significantly, I'll disable some services^^
02:12 <@Dune> cool to hear :) thanks for the hosting
02:22 < TeeSlayer> np
02:22 < TeeSlayer> @LordSk the mod overwrites the options?
02:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> a few yes
02:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> needed for the mod to work properly
02:24 < TeeSlayer> ok just the gamemodes
10:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> iVampire is king <3
10:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> And btw Dune, I personally don't like the shields, too. But I see the potential for high skilled games, thus it may be a very great addition. At least some fresh ideas are always nice.
10:35 < rand> what is iVampire ?
10:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Thanks for asking. https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=8062
10:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> You gain life by killing opponents. Eventually you can survive some hits. You even can transfer your life to teammates, just in case.
10:44 < rand> that means I will give life to my enemies way to fast x)
10:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Feeding is real, yes.
12:56 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> Dune: I have some 0.7 DDRace remake code lying around.
12:57 <@Dune> ohey Zeta-Hoernchen_
12:59 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> It has some more features than just freeze, but it's completely rewritten from 0.7.
13:00 <@Dune> I didn't actually port any features, just wrote freeze for 0.7 to have fun on some vintage maps. I mean, DDRace with just freeze is very light to implement and nicely portable
13:00 <@Dune> I'm not sure what features are necessary for other maps - I'm keen on keeping it minimalistic
13:00 <@Dune> what did you write? :)
13:01 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> I know of at least one breaking change for some maps
13:01 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> Because the current DDRace keeps you unfrozen for one more tick if you enter freeze.
13:01 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> And mine doesn't, i think.
13:02 <@Dune> ah, the freeze duration is too long?
13:02 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> No, the first tick you are in freeze does not freeze you.
13:02 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> Thats why if you have a high speed, you can still jump out of a one tile deep freeze pool.
13:03 <@Dune> arr, I see. that's a tricky one to notice :)
13:03 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> I didn't want to preserve random inconsistent behavior just to maintain compatibility.
13:04 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> My implementation has semi-transparent walls of all kinds
13:04 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> so there is hook-through.
13:05 <@Dune> well it's interesting if you have material
13:05 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> I aimed to add every feature of DDRace, but i stopped at some point, because i lost interest since 0.7 didn't seem to go anywhere.
13:05 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> https://github.com/Speedy-Consoles/teeworlds/tree/ddrace
13:05 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> it's really old now and not merged with the master, i think
13:06 <@Dune> there just isn't any 0.7 code so I figured it is actually quite quick, adding a ton of features is not my priority (nor my goal)
13:07 <@Dune> thanks for the link. I'll keep it around if a major feature is lacking and credit you
13:07 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> Have you thought about making the freeze tiles' collision like the one of the kill tiles?
13:07 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> Because that would be way more consistent
13:08 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> but in no way compatible with old maps.
13:08 <@Dune> it was like that originally - I mean that's the default thing
13:09 <@Dune> but it breaks even the first maps as far as I can tell so meh
13:13 <@Dune> since you've done so much work, do you have any idea if there are any necessary, common features beyond freeze?
13:25 <@Dune> https://github.com/Speedy-Consoles/teeworlds/commit/f4c6a5207ec8e40f99d84635040ad9535ff9d346 I assume
13:33 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> Eh, yes, i think so. That was almost 5 years ago.
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> whaaat, that was ddrace feature

14:43 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> I also added the "cry" feature for when you are frozen.
14:44 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> And there is some nice ice cube animation instead of the ninja skin.
14:44 <@Dune_> server-side? :o
14:44 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> Yes, it's all server side.
14:44 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> It's not compatible to vanilla right now
14:44 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> You would have a ton of prediction errors.
14:45 <@Dune_> so you need client-side changes?
14:45 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> Yes.
14:46 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> But of course you could add some code in the server that sends alternative Vanilla or 0.6 net traffic to those clients who don't know about it.
14:46 <@Dune_> ah so it's not all server side
14:47 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> Ah, that's what you mean
14:47 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> You need server and client.
14:48 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> The plan was to add compatibility afterwards.
14:48 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> But someone else lost the motivation to do that as well :D
14:49 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> I could try to set up a server if you want to check it out
14:49 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> It's really smooth with server AND client having the features.
14:49 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> But we're talking about a new game mode in 0.7, aren't we?
14:50 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> And 0.6 clients won't be able to connect to 0.7 servers anyway, right?
14:51 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> If that's the case compatibility shouldn't be an issue.
14:54 <@Dune_> huh, it's not about making ddrace official
14:55 <@Dune_> I just did a couple of mods in a corner in a couple of days because it's low effort
14:56 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> Awww :(
14:57 <@Dune_> sorry if there was a misunderstanding
14:58 <@Dune_> race is bound to be official though, so we have to start with that :) but it's a lot of work to make it properly, server AND client
14:58 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> Well, the race part that would be official should be used in the mod then.
14:59 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> Like finish tiles.
14:59 <@Dune_> of course :) but has to be done first, it's a lot of work
14:59 <@Dune_> and everyone wants something different to be prioritized
15:57 < TeeSlayer> https://github.com/Matodor/TeeSharp why though
15:59 <@Dune_> :o
16:04 < TeeSlayer> ddrace server doesn't have collision or hook
16:05 <@Dune_> TeeSlayer: vote
16:05 < TeeSlayer> ah
16:05 < TeeSlayer> thx
16:12 < TeeSlayer> the freeze is too aggressive i think
16:16 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> There are probably just a bunch of minor things in addition to freeze that need to be added for simple DDRace.
16:16 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> like no damage
16:24 <@Dune_> yeah, that's a setting in redix's race but should be forced :)
16:40 < TeeSlayer> Dune_: ah you're hosting it on your own pc, that's why it's so laggy xD
16:44 <@Dune_> yeah, sorry xD
16:48 <@Dune_> i'm just testing, but everything seems fixed now
16:54 < TeeSlayer> Dune_: link to repo/branch?
16:55 < TeeSlayer> for ddrace
16:55 < TeeSlayer> is it "ddr"?
16:55 <@Dune_> wait
17:06 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed pull request #1919: Fix build for msvc (master...msvc_build) https://git.io/fhJHa
17:10 <@Dune_> hey, oy
17:11 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> src/engine/client/text.cpp:13:10: fatal error: 'ft2build.h' file not found
17:11 <@Dune_> is there any merging/testing work to do on the 5 old PRs?
17:11 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> what am i doing wrong?
17:11 <@Dune_> freetype, Zeta-Hoernchen_
17:11 < Oy> hey
17:12 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> i got this https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/freetype2/
17:12 <@Dune_> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything_linux
17:12 <@Dune_> hmm
17:12 <@Dune_> I think I had this problem on 32 bit linux
17:13 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> 64bit here
17:13 <@Dune_> had to hardcode freetype paths
17:14 < Oy> Dune_: the http master was just an example, could probably be closed
17:15 <@Dune_> yeha +1
17:15 <@Dune_> the list maps break compatibility right
17:16 < Oy> Dune_: dunno if the sorting algorithms should be added, would need some extensive testing to make sure they work corectly - think i already saw a bug when looking at it years ago
17:16 <@Dune_> hmm, what should be done :/
17:16 <@Dune_> heinrich5991: ^
17:17 <@Dune_> it's difficult to test
17:17 < Oy> the map list could be added, wanted to add a different behaviour to provide the information to the clients, before adding it - never had the time
17:18 <@Dune_> does it break compatibility?
17:18 < Oy> well, old clients wouldn't support it
17:19 < Oy> did it in 0.6 the same way with providing the rcon commands
17:20 < Oy> that waiting queue seems very outdated and breaks compatibility
17:20 <@Dune_> so it has to be ported to 0.7
17:20 < Oy> well, dunno if could be doable in a reasonable fashion without breaking compatibility
17:21 <@Dune_> well I'm not sure if the implementation is a good idea at all
17:21 <@Dune_> sounds like it would need client side integration
17:22 < Oy> yeah, client+server and protocol
17:23 <@Dune_> there is this btw https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1167/commits/3197db3097d97fbd42cc7f9ca8aeb52e74f63656
17:23 <@Dune_> I mean, it may require some additional UI
17:25 < Oy> that's what i was talking about
17:25 < Oy> the waiting queue
17:25 <@Dune_> ah
17:32 < Zeta-Hoernchen_> my repo wasn't up to date...
17:32 <@Dune_> ah, you didn't push?
17:32 <@Dune_> TeeSlayer: can you come? password is dne
17:33 < TeeSlayer> Dune_: I'm there
17:45 < TeeSlayer> Dune_: there are no laser walls (+switcher) or teleports right?
17:45 < TeeSlayer> in the upcoming release
17:45 <@Dune_> it is based on race so there is everything race
17:46 < TeeSlayer> okay
17:46 <@Dune_> it's only race+freeze

19:59 < Oy> hm. works for me
19:59 < Oy> sec
20:01 < Oy> works from the vs command prompt, but not from "cmd" cause it can't set up the environment
20:02 < Oy> Dune_: https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/issues/4 that's not fixed by that commit. should probably still add some notice
20:02 <@Dune_> @Savander knows the issue better
20:04 <@Dune_> ah, sorry Oy, should have been more careful
20:05 < Oy> probably some info here https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/blob/master/support/faq.md#faq ?
20:06 <@Dune_> hmmm
20:06 <@Dune_> yeah
20:06 <@Dune_> it's the best place
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> feels like faq is missing some issues
20:10 <@Dune_> yeah
20:11 <@Dune_> feel free to list them in an issue
20:11 <@Dune_> @Fisico already helped a lot with the doc :)
20:11 < Oy> yeah, faq could be expanded
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah, we should start with the most asked ones
20:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i think there was a thread in the forum
20:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> but is probably outdated
20:12 <@Dune_> you could find it and post whatever issues are most relevant
20:12 <@Dune_> github is convenient for that
20:14 < Oy> there used to be a help page by intel that showed how to proceed with this issue https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/issues/4 - but seems that page is gone :(
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> works from the vs command prompt, but not from "cmd" cause it can't set up the environment, you mean compiling teeworlds or bam
20:15 < Oy> http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-030506.htm that was the one
20:15 < Oy> Savander both
20:16 < minus> that link redirects me to the main support page
20:16 <@Dune_> me2
20:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> bam doesn't allow by default use vs2017, because https://github.com/matricks/bam/blob/master/make_win32_msvc.bat#L3-L22
20:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> doesn't search for 2017 version
20:17 < Oy> yeah, that link used to work in the past :(
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I mean, you have to run cmd manually and then use https://github.com/matricks/bam/blob/master/make_win32_msvc.bat#L45-L64
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> with build tools
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Are the translations documented somewhere? Where/how to contribute
20:17 < Oy> got it from here https://steamcommunity.com/app/380840/discussions/0/517141807565645142/#c517141882713332411
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <MertenNor> https://www.transifex.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/dashboard/
20:18 < Oy> Savander: just open the vs command prompt and then run the make script
20:19 < Oy> Sonix there is a description on top of teeworlds-languages repository
20:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I meant in the documentation
20:19 < Oy> *teeworlds-translations
20:19 < Oy> don't think so
20:19 < Oy> docs are pretty old
20:20 < Oy> translations were added later
20:22 <@Dune_> they are in the wiki of teeworlds-translation iirc
20:22 <@Dune_> i wrote them
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I'll just open an issue as a reminder
20:23 <@Dune_> ah nah it's for porting/backporting
20:23 <@Dune_> contributing translations is just using transifex
20:23 <@Dune_> @Sonix
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Yeah i guess a line in FAQ leading to transifex could be added
20:23 < Oy> yeah
20:24 <@Dune_> In teeworlds.com FAQ?
20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Okay, it works. Great. ðŸ˜ƒ But, the question is, why bam force gcc instead of cl ?
20:25 <@Dune_> bam config compiler=cl works I guess
20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> also, if i compile with default `bam.exe config`
20:25 < Oy> DUne yeah
20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> that's right, but with gcc it doesn't. It compiles, but doesn't run
20:26 < Oy> Savander it checks for gcc first then cl - uses what it finds first
20:26 <@DUne> =D
20:26 < Oy> :P
20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> yea, it compiles just fine. But running such application
20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> doesn't work
20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> the question, why
20:26 < Oy> oh
20:26 < Oy> let me check
20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> it says: "_ZdllPvj entry point"
20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> is missing
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> with CL, it compiles and run both ðŸ˜„
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> it doesn't matter if it's client or server
20:29 < Oy> works for me
20:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> So I don't know, could find any resources
20:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> about that problem :/
20:30 < Oy> do u use http://www.mingw.org/ ?
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> yes
20:30 < Oy> ok me too
20:30 < Oy> did u use bam build with cl?
20:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> yea
20:31 < Oy> me too
20:31 < Oy> x86 or x64 debug or release?
20:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> x86_64, debug
20:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> will try other
20:32 < Oy> ah that one shouldn't work
20:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> huh?
20:32 < Oy> mingw is just for 32bit
20:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> ðŸ˜®
20:32 < Oy> there's a mingw64, but never tried it myself
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> hmmm
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> are you compile bam with vs2017 64x or 86x?
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> don't know if it matters
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> but, x86, debug, server
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> the same thing, the same error
20:37 < Oy> use bam 64 when building 64bit tw and 86 otherwise
20:37 < Oy> do a "bam config compiler=cl"
20:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> That one works ðŸ˜ƒ
20:38 < Oy> the sdl/freetype libs are probably set to 64bit right now
20:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> sdl/freetype doesn't matter with server
20:38 < Oy> yeah, shouldn't :D
20:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Okay, so I make sure that i do it on fresh bam config
20:41 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/blob/master/support/faq.md "Q: The game stopped working, how do I fix it?" you can start the game with --default now to reset the config
20:41 < Oy> should probably update that info
20:42 < Oy> savander yeah, alsways best to do that line when switching arch or compiler :)
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> So I used: `make_win32_msvc.bat`, to compile BAM. Then, I used `bam.exe config` (it set compiler to gcc, and libs to 32bit).
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> compilation went good, but running
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> the same problem
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> maybe i have problem with my os. Can i send you my binnary ?
20:42 < Oy> hm
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> teeworlds_srv
20:42 < Oy> is cl set in bam config?
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> nope, gcc
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> gcc is set by default
20:43 < Oy> ok
20:43 < Oy> do a bam -c all
20:43 < Oy> and then run again
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> same thing
20:44 < Oy> that'S odd
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> If you don't mind
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> https://we.tl/t-NB6KccbhkS
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> teeworlds_srv, x86, debug
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Maybe my OS is the problem ^.^
20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> if yes, then huh.. user problem
20:47 < Oy> works for me
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> haha, great
20:47 <@Dune> :x
20:47 < Oy> but the file is pretty big
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> it's debug version, maybe that's why
20:48 < Oy> twice the size of what i get when compiling x86 debug
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> ðŸ˜®
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> i will try to update mingw then
20:48 < Oy> oh gcc
20:49 < Oy> yeah, that one is that big too
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> https://gyazo.com/fb3aa366376d536f6a73154af3d2e322
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I think, i have everything what i should have. But if it's problem from my site
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> then, maybe we shouldn't even try to solve that. It will be hard to find solution ðŸ˜ƒ
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> i can compile with CL just fine
20:52 < Oy> looks the same on my mingw install manager
20:52 < Oy> what kind of error msg do u get, when u want to start the server?
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I have polish message, but: "_ZdllPvj entry point of procedure not found in library teeworlds_srv.exe"
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> sorry "_ZdlPvj"
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> without that second "L"
20:55 < Oy> something gone wrong while linking
20:57 < Oy> could u manually delete builds/x86/debug/obj
20:57 < Oy> and then build again
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I cloned again teeworlds, removed old one
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> the same :/
21:00 < Oy> :(
21:00 < Oy> rebuild bam?
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> gcc (MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1) 6.3.0
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> correct version?
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> could you check?
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I think, yes
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> yes, i did.
21:01 < Oy> yeah same
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> let me try, build bam with "mingw" version, instead of
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> msvc
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> uhm
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Same thing. That's odd.
21:05 < Oy> https://we.tl/t-UHxcEWzMiC
21:05 < Oy> my bam
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> same thing, not bam related then
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> i will reinstall completly mingw
21:13 < Oy> hm, don't think it's mingw related
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> yea, i don't think it will change anything
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I just updated it to newest version..
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> ;D
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Anyway, it's day before new year. We shouldn't bother ðŸ˜ƒ
21:15 <@Dune> is it?
21:15 < Oy> you could try to restart windows and then try again
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> no changes ðŸ˜›
21:22 < Oy> do u have an autoexec or other config file that u use with the server?
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> i have content
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> from bam
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> whole data/
21:24 < Oy> then i'm out of ideas :)
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Me either. ðŸ˜„  hahaha
21:38 < TeeSlayer> 0.7 has now a blocker server, too :DD
21:39 < TeeSlayer> I should disable vote kick
21:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> ðŸ¤¦
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> facepalm*
21:53 < TeeSlayer> nobody wants to chill on a 0.7 blocker server? xD
21:54 <@Dune> I doubt you'll find your public here
22:58 <@Dune> should I PR this? https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/commit/81cb593caf855b4eab95aeedcb06f26bb23d7df2
22:58 <@Dune> it sanitizes gametype names so we don't end up looking for impossible filenames
23:45 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr opened pull request #1938: Sanitize gametypes with str_sanitize_filename (master...feature-sanitize-filenames) https://git.io/fhLD3
