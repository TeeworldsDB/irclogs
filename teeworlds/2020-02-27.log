01:33 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> so I have an idea that I'm going to shotgun in here because I suspect it *MAY* be of interest
01:34 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> so there's this FPS alien versus predator game
01:34 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> kind of a cult classic, not the biggest gaming franchise in history, noteworthy because you play as human marines, aliens, or predators
01:36 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> the aliens climb the walls, see in the dark, and basically have the run of the place, but they also don't have much range
01:37 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> the predators have a grappling hook that they can climb vertically with
01:38 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> and the human marines have a jetpack that works in short bursts
01:41 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> now, the reason I think it's interesting here, is that there's three popular sidescroller games that have mechanics that more or less match these three profiles, of which teeworlds is obviously one
01:43 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> soldat is the second, I'm sure everybody here has heard of it but if not *ABSOLUTELY* go download it now and try it out, it runs just fine in WINE
01:44 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> soldat has a jetpack mechanic and a number of sidescroller versions of classical actual military weapons, m79 grenade launchers and SOCOM pistols and gattling guns and such
01:48 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> the last one, maybe surprising, is the original sidescroller version of the gex franchise, which has a mechanic for sticking to vertical platform segments, and also to background walls, as two separate mechanics, and had a number of close combat options like bouncing from above onto enemies, whipping with a tail, etc.
19:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> after some fiddling ðŸ˜„ I made a moderation bot that connects your teeworlds econ to your discord channel. if anyone needs something like that, here you go. we currently use this for zCatch server moderation. https://github.com/jxsl13/TeeworldsEconDiscordModerationBot Depending on your settings, you can connect on a specific discord channel to a specific econ. the bot tries to hide as much IP-related information as possible(not ever
19:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> executing commands is also possible.
19:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and an access rights "system" is implemented in order to give people access on the fly. commands that can be executed via this terminal can be configured in the bot settings, have fun :0
20:21 < bridge> [freenode] <uovobw> it appears some text was snipped from the message of jsxl13? it ends abruptly at "as possible(not eve"
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as possible(not everything, tho). what becomes visible in the discord channel is a kind of econ terminal that can be used to read chat, see votes and so on. (requires the parsing patch mentioned in one of the issues) have fun
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's for players possible to request moderators by pinging them via @mods, which get's translated to a specific role ping.
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> in discord
20:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes, IRC messages are limited in capacity
20:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> probably best to advertise that bot on the discord channel, doubt the IRC guys care anyway
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe they do :0 use discord occasionally.
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> discord messages have a capacity of up to 2000 characters.
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> !op zc
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> wrong channel ._.
