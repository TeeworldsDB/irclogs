19:56 < heinrich5991> what is C in practice? http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/notes50-2015-05-24-survey-discussion.html
19:56 < heinrich5991> (e.g. TW relies on the compiler not touching the padding)
20:02 < EastByte> could you explain a little bit?
20:02 < EastByte> what's the problem of a compiler touching the padding
22:16 < heinrich5991> EastByte: I think I was wrong
22:16 < heinrich5991> I thought there was padding in NETADDR, but now I believe there isn't
22:28 < EastByte> heinrich5991: looks like 22 bytes
22:28 < EastByte> which implies a 2 byte padding?
23:29 < heinrich5991> EastByte: if that's the case, then TW relies on the compiler not touching the padding
