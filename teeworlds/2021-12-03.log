22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> teeworlds dual wielding, when?
22:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> perhaps some day. What would you dual wield? The Hammer? The Gun?
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ðŸ˜‚ two grenade launchers
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> katanas -NINJAAA
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> 2 hooks \:p
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> I'd go for shotguns, absolute killing machine closeby
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I go for 2 hammers, so i can kill Stiopa in ctf
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> sounds like what was it called SICK?
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> the tuned ctf servers xd
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> sounds like default vanilla, but with 2x more damage per weapon
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> Sick sick... I recall something like that? Wasn't that vani ctf but you had insane hook, insane amount of ammo etc.? I remember playing that years ago!
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> i mean the one where you had like almost no fire delay and tons of spread \:D
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> it was pure trash but ye it had full servers
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> Well as a newbie at the time I did enjoy it for a bit but it got quite stale after sometime
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> Also Assa, if you want to kill me in ctf you gotta catch me, and I bet you can't catch me underwater. ;) ;)
