13:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> teeworlds.com multiple choise polls would be nice ðŸ˜¢
13:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> choice*
13:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's already there @jxsl13
13:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> afaik you can select a vote count in punBB
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> how the heck does that work xD?
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think that votes count is complementary to the day, how long the poll runs, thus when one of them is reached, the poll ends
14:32 < bridge> [freenode] <RopeClash> Hi is anybody here?
14:33 < RopeClash> Hi guys
14:34 < RopeClash> I'm working on a new mobile game for android very similar to teeworlds and would love some early feedback from you guys
14:35 < RopeClash> Here's the link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mesibagames.ropeclash
17:18 < Dune> so rope is hook eh
17:19 < Dune> I wonder if it feels like teeworlds :)
17:25 < RopeClash> I also made a gameplay video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk6fP-IqAT0&feature=youtu.be
17:26 < Dune> it reminds me more of hedgewars with the bounces the creatures do
17:27 < Dune> teeworlds has different physics where the tee is pulled towards the target of the hook
17:27 < Dune> I guess that's the difference between a rope and a hook
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> It remindes me a lot of worms
