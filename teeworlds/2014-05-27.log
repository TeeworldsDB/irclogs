00:03 < deen> Still no idea, sorry
00:07 <@matricks> weird behaviour
00:07 <@matricks> 30fps sounds like a vsync issue
00:08 <@matricks> the fps spike is when a texture update happens due to new glyphs being rendered
00:08 < deen> on radeon when it can't sustain 60fps it automatically goes down to 30. alebrije: did you try setting FSAA to 0?
00:09 < deen> alebrije: and it would not go down to 30 if you set xv_vsync 0
00:09 <@matricks> clean the guck out of the mouse?
00:11 < alebrije> deen: FSAA = 0 on my config, i never use it
00:13 < alebrije> matricks: is not problem of my mouse, :P
00:25 < alebrije> At 1600x900 on window mode dont have that lag/spikes problem: http://i.imgur.com/VNLCepR.jpg
00:26 < alebrije> So... its a problem of Vsync on fullscreen?
00:26 < deen> No
00:26 < deen> I think it's the high resolution
00:26 < deen> and the text makes your fps drop a bit
00:27 < deen> once you go below 60 fps your gpu switches to 30 fps
00:27 < deen> but you can also try lower resolutions at fullscreen
00:29 < alebrije> the native res of my screen is 1920x1080 and if a select a lower resolution on fullscreen, dont look fine. On full screen i must select the native resolution (1920x1080)
01:36 < alebrije> bye all
01:36 < alebrije> (and thx for all)
01:36 < alebrije> weeeeeeeeee
01:36 < alebrije> o/
10:59 < ircu> matricks: http://torrentfreak.com/huge-wolfenstein-download-infuriates-but-doesnt-deter-pirates-140526/ 
10:59 < ircu> you're a genius
11:00 < ircu> “43GB, the hell? No thanks, guess I will buy this when the price drops to £29.99,” said user u2konline.
11:01 <@matricks> hehe
11:02 < ircu> pack it w/ loads of zeros 
11:02 < ircu> srsly if that was on purpose, i applaud you
11:03 <@minus> is the steam release smaller?
11:04 <@minus> 43G doesn't take that long to DL though
11:04 <@minus> except if shitty swarm
11:17 <@matricks> if it just were zeros, that would be compressed down
11:17 <@matricks> but the data that is on there is already heavily compressed to fit on a bluray so you can't really compressit
11:17 <@matricks> *compress it
11:18 <@minus> for your next game go with procedual texture generation!
11:18 <@minus> saves a ton of space
11:19 <@matricks> hehe
11:19 <@minus> you might have longer loading times though
11:20 <@minus> Requests per second:    11040.99 [#/sec] (mean)
11:20  * minus nods and continues stuff
11:21 <@matricks> procedual kinda goes against what we do, and we already do a bit of it
11:21 <@matricks> if I remember correctly
11:21 <@minus> against what you do? why?
11:21 <@minus> artists can operate procedual data generation tools too
11:21 <@matricks> every texel in the world is unique and the artist has control over veryone of em
11:21 <@minus> CPU @ 96C :/
11:22 <@matricks> a problem in the games industry today is to generate and build all the content that is needed
11:24 <@matricks> also.. 1.5 weeks left before I go to austria
11:24 <@minus> yay, a bunch of OOM kills
11:24 <@minus> :D
11:24 <@matricks> also, I've not heard anything that wolf has been banned in germany yet
11:26 < koomi> it's not banned, just censored
11:26 <@matricks> I know, I impelemented most of the systems to censor it
11:26 < koomi> ah :D
11:26 <@minus> can they be circumvented?
11:27 <@matricks> no
11:27 <@minus> boring
11:27 <@matricks> we made sure that it doesn't even gets written to the disc
11:27 <@matricks> koomi: I'm just hoping that we didn't miss anything
11:27 <@minus> replacing all swastikas?
11:27 <@matricks> minus: more then that
11:27 <@minus> than*
11:27 <@matricks> soo much more then that
11:27 <@matricks> than
11:28 <@matricks> like.. the number 14...
11:28 <@matricks> and 88
11:28 <@matricks> and HH
11:28 <@matricks> etc etc
11:29 <@matricks> there is a locker room somewhere in the game where the lockersw go 11,12,13,..,15,16,17
11:29 <@matricks> >.<
11:29 <@minus> wat
11:29 <@minus> that's just retarded
11:29 <@minus> why 14?
11:29 <@minus> and 88?
11:30 <@minus> they're not even prime numbers
11:30 <@matricks> they didn't wanna take any chances
11:30 <@matricks> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Words
11:30 <@matricks> 88, 8:th letter in the alphabet is H.. 88 == HH == Heil Hitler
11:31 <@minus> right
11:32 <@matricks> we censored 23423914986 as well
11:32 <@matricks> because it had 14 in it
11:32 <@minus> i hope you replaced all that with something nice
11:33 <@matricks> yeah, we exchange the swastikas for wolf logoes, made up new ones etc etc
13:21 <@matricks> someone suggested we do this http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/appdata/
14:10 <@minus> file a bug report!
14:10 <@minus> or tell them to do so
14:11 <@minus> heinrich5991 might just do it
19:04 < savander> Hey!, Someone here have zCatch source for 0.6 ? Because on github, i found only updated version.. (for 0.7) :/
19:13 < BeaR_> savander: maybe this one ? (haven't tested) https://github.com/Teetime/teeworlds/tree/zCatch
19:13 < heinrich5991> savander: can you point me to the updated one?
19:16 < savander> in official thread
