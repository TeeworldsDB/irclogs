09:15 < day> Dune: o.0
09:15 < day> Dune: don't tell me theres another setting that turns it on or off
09:19 < bridge> [freenode] <richrd> oh hi Digit, wavi here! any idea what happened to lizard?
09:34 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> i pop in from time to time (in the best of the fake lizards), per chance to catch a crowd.  bzhu's game sometimes pops up too.  usually in the small morning hours of gmt.
09:35  * bridge [freenode] <Digit> pops in for a walk
09:36 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> lizard no lag, come on in, the weather is warm. come play, come play.  :)
09:37 < rand> friendly fire ?
09:37 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> the only way to play.
09:37 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> sorts the skill from the spray
09:37 < rand> nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, bombing everywhere ! scanning by spamming pistol !
09:38 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> skilled spray's different.  ;)
09:38 < rand> :]
09:39 < rand> game is different with friendly fire, I never played it with skilled players
10:13 < bridge> [freenode] <richrd> nice to hear, I'll come by some time
10:13 < bridge> [freenode] <richrd> I kind of miss the friendly fire games on lizard
10:14 < bridge> [freenode] <richrd> I'm tempted to setup a lizard clone with all the same maps etc
10:39  * bridge [freenode] <Digit> spectating on the one with humptydumpty, crimescene & extra mile.  pity no dogfight or darkened cave.
10:39 < day> rand: mario found someone who agreed to 1v1 him on dm1
10:40 < day> yesterday evening
10:40 < day> "winter" maybe you've seen him. i frequently plays ctf5. it was a massacre ^.^
10:41 < day> s/i/He
10:47 < rand> meh
10:47 < rand> winter is good
10:47 < rand> the guys we played with yesterday without name was also strong enough
10:47 < rand> mario is… flawless
15:16 < day> right..i was curious who that was
15:17 < day> Taipan or w/e his name is is solid as well. and then theres another guy with a polish flag/ clan tag
19:28 <@Dune> someone asked how comes no one suggested rewriting teeworlds in rust
19:40 <@heinrich5991> we could write some components in rust if we wanted to ;)
19:40 <@heinrich5991> 0.17 is out!!
19:40 <@heinrich5991> for 30min already
19:53 <@Dune> of? factorio?
19:53 <@heinrich5991> yes :)
20:00 < rand> Dune: did you answer, “feel free to do it” ? :3
20:00 < rand> part of the protocol has been done iirc (?)
20:01 <@Dune> no, it's more like he was amazed the search for the string "rust" on github returned no result
20:01 < rand> libtw2 \o/
20:01 <@Dune> yeah :D
20:01 <@Dune> I didn't figure what all those tools were for
20:01 < rand> no readme :c
20:02 <@Dune> feel free to PR one :3
20:02 < rand> han
20:02  * rand has left
20:02  * Dune waves
20:05 < rand> i guess the code is selfdocumenting
20:06 <@heinrich5991> just ask me :)
20:06 <@heinrich5991> it has a PoC 0.6 server
20:06 <@Dune> rand, so like teeworlds
20:06 < rand> I like exploring, I dont do rust
20:06 < rand> wow
20:06 < rand> Poc server is nice
20:07 < rand> like, awesome
20:08 < rand> i have to gather the pieces of mind that spread on the floor because of mind blow
20:08 <@Dune> how is your mind typed?
20:08 <@Dune> ordered set?
20:12 < rand> partially ordered set
20:13 <@Dune> that makes searches inefficient
22:48 <@heinrich5991> and 0.17.1 is out :P
23:02 < minus> Of teeworlds? :o
23:06 <@Dune> that sounds a lot like teeworlds :D always releasing a .1 right after :P
