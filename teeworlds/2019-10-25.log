15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Okay, so my master problem is for real rcon auth. Whenever I login to rcon it will fail during the next master server check.
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Why?
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Any ideas?
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Strange
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
16:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yikes my log system broke :/
16:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> just why https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/c705f048f3f62e0ed92686e19763a61309125d98 :c
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so my only options are a symlink or creating a dumps directory? :/
16:30 < rand> if you built a log system above teeworlds, you should find a solution on your side I guessâ€¦ but, "dumps/blah.txt" is meh for a log path file
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> my side relies on the log path being in a specific dir
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i dont want to move all my logs into the tw folder now :/ i am used to the place where it was and polluting it with a bunch of dumps folders is not what i want
