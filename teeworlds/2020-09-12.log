16:18 < fablt> Hi, I'm planning to host a game session with friends where we switch maps about every 15 minutes
16:18 < fablt> As I understood, I have to run a server myself for this. Is this correct?
16:23 < fablt> If so, is there a map selector where I can preview the maps before I switch? The only way I found so far is the change_map command where I have to know the available map names and can't preview them
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> As far as I am aware, there exists no specific "map viewer" created for the sole purpose of previewing maps ingame. However, you can open the map editor using ctrl-shift-e and load the specific maps in it to check them out prior to map change. All of the default maps should be there available
16:47 < fablt> bridge: Good to know, thanks
16:48 < fablt> And is it right that I have to run a server myself? Or would it be possible to find and empty running server and switch through the maps there?
16:48 < fablt> *an empty
17:02 < Dune> fablt: I believe you can list map with some command
17:02 < Dune> "maps" maybe
17:02 < Dune> if you can't, we should add that :p
17:03 < fablt> Dune: I think I tried typing "maps" and seeing if there was a completion, but there wasn't
17:03 < Dune> ah, welp
17:04 < fablt> The hint with the map editor is fine for me for the moment, but being able to list maps would be nice indeed
17:05 < Dune> standard maps are all dmX ctfX
17:05 < fablt> I just found the "ec_" server settings. What does external console mean?
17:05 < Dune> if you want to switch maps every 15min you need to set sv_maprotation and sv_timelimit 15
17:05 < fablt> Ah nice
17:06 < Dune> ec_ is rcon except you access it without opening the game at all
17:06 < Dune> hence "external"
17:06 < fablt> So I can be in another game but still access the console of my server? Or is it accessible from the terminal?
17:09 < Dune> no, external console is from outside of Teeworlds
17:10 < Dune> you don't need to use it unless you specifically want the convenience of managing your server without oepning the game
17:11 < fablt> I see, all right. Just out of curiosity: how do you connect to it? SSH?
17:11 < Dune> uuh almost never used it, not SSH iirc
17:19 < fablt> OK, never mind then
17:19 < fablt> I just started a server locally to test the "maps" command
17:19 < fablt> It indeed doesn't exist
17:20 < Dune> oh don't, it doesn't exist
17:20 < Dune> yeah
17:20 < fablt> But I was suprised that someone joined the server!
17:20 < fablt> How come? I thought I first have to configure port forwarding etc.
17:20 < Dune> you do
17:21 < fablt> Huh. So I have to check if I configured my router in the past
17:21 < Dune> or you joined the wrong server
17:22 < fablt> I could call change_map, so it must've been mine, I though
17:22 < fablt> +t
17:22 < Dune> oh, well if rcon works yeah :D
17:22 < fablt> And I can see the player joining in the terminal output of the server
17:23 < Dune> yeah so your ports are open
17:24 < fablt> I'm just checking, I'm really curious now. That was quite a surprise :D
17:26 < fablt> Indeed TCP port 5500 is being forwarded. But I ran the server without configuration file and I thought the default port is 8000something?
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> 8303 is the default port
17:32 < fablt> That's unexpected then. I have only one rule added in the port forwarding section and it says "<my local IPv4>, TCP, port 5500-5500"
17:46 < Dune> weird
17:47 < fablt> I'm trying with a configuration file now where I explicitly set a port other than 5500
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> econ uses telnet fot communication. a client like putty should work.
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> for
17:56 < fablt> Ah, thanks!
18:06 < fablt> Hm, now I started with a very small server configuration file with "sv_port 8333" and it doesn't even show up in the "Local" tab
18:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> "please join to test if the server ca"? is that the one you hosted?
18:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> Just asking, since it has the "8333" port :p
18:12 < Dune> the Local tab only shows servers with ports close to the default port
18:12 < Dune> 8333 probably doesn't qualify
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> 8303-8310 IIRC
18:12 < Dune> we should fix the UI somehow to indicate this
18:12 < Dune> don't you think @hein
18:12 < Dune> heinrich5991?
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm not sure where to add it
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in the LAN UI?
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> mentioning that we only scan ports 8303 to 8310?
18:14 < fablt> That's the one!
18:15 < Dune> yeah
18:17 < fablt> But I can't find it in the Global tab even
18:18 <@heinrich5991> fablt: your own server usually doesn't appear in the global tab
18:18 < fablt> Ah, I see
18:18 <@heinrich5991> it appears for others there if you don't get the "please activate port forwarding" message
18:18 <@heinrich5991> if you tell me your IP, I can also check it
18:19 < fablt> I'm checking it
18:19 < fablt> 89.14.145.20
18:20 <@heinrich5991> I'm online
18:20 <@heinrich5991> on port 8333
18:21 < fablt> Right, I can see it in the logs
18:21 < fablt> How can I join then? Via local IP?
18:22 <@heinrich5991> either change the port to something between 8303  to 8310, or just enter "localhost:8333" in the address field
18:27 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2729
18:28 < Dune> "list available maps" is https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1972 actually
18:28 < Dune> thanks to Learath2's PR, you should be able to see the maps you can use using autocompletion from sv_map, fablt
18:33 < fablt> Nice, thanks!
18:35 < fablt> Heinrich has clarified why it works without port forwarding, it's UDP
18:36 < fablt> Now I just have to find a good configuration, then I can test if a server on my laptop can handle 16 players
18:36 < fablt> What's the difference between sv_max_clients and sv_player_slots?
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> sv_max_clients is the proper amount of clients allowed in your server, and sv_player_slots is the amount of slots for clients that are playing. 4 player_slots and 16 max_clients would amount to 4 players and 12 spectators
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=server_settings is pretty useful
18:44 < fablt> I see, thanks! I've been looking at that page and set both to 16, but wanted to be sure I understood correctly
19:06 < fablt> Do the map names and game types have to match? E.g. can I play CTF on dm3?
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <a gerdoe> you can, but dm3 has no flags
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ctf on dm3 is meaningless, there are no flags
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you can play dm on ctf maps though
19:13 < fablt> OK, good to know, I'll have to pick the right maps for CTF then
19:19 < fablt> Last question :)
19:20 < fablt> I tried to add a vote to change the game type with "sv_gametype ctf" but that didn't seem to work
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> need to reload after that
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> type `reload`
19:21 < fablt> I see. I did that when I typed sv_gametype directly, but I thought after a vote it happens directly
19:21 < fablt> Thanks
19:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> can add it into the vote
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> "sv_gametype ctf; reload"
19:22 < fablt> Command separation with semicolons, noted
19:23 < fablt> So I could probably also put a batch of commands in a file and call "exec file" then, right?
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
19:23 < fablt> Perfect
19:26 < fablt> Thanks a lot, all of you! I'm usually hesitant to join IRC channels because in my previous experience people either didn't reply for several days or they didn't provide helpful answers. The experience in this channel was nothing like that :)
19:30 <@heinrich5991> you found a good time
19:30 <@heinrich5991> we're not online 24/7 to answer questions ^^
19:33 < fablt> Haha, yeah, I didn't expect that :D But it's still not that usual that people reply competently to all the questions in a friendly way
19:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> no problem! I hope you and your friends have a great time playing! Especially with the variety in maps one can make and of mods that one can play!
19:34 < fablt> I had tried to find the information in the forum, but the search didn't really return useful results
19:34 < fablt> Thanks, I feel so much better prepared now. I think it'll be great fun!
19:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> Out of curiosity, how many people will be playing?
19:36 < fablt> I have seen the number 16 on the website, so I provided this as the maximum number of participants
19:36 < fablt> But seeing that the defaults are lower, I might go with a lower number
19:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> I believe 16 is the max ingame playerbase, but you can have extra 48 spectating
19:38 < fablt> Also I'm not sure yet if my connection and my laptop will make it with 16
19:38 < fablt> Good to know!
19:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> Only time will tell I suppose. Good luck! I hope teeworlds proves to be a great experience. I, for one, am still having fun after few years. But I did burn out a few times. If you are looking for non-vanilla maps to spice up your game, I recommend the Maps section on the forums, it's got some interesting maps
19:43 < fablt> Thanks! I've actually played some years ago and am picking it up again to keep in touch with people despite Corona
19:45 < fablt> I might even contribute to the code, seeing that this game is still in active development after all that time :) I'll see if I find time for this now and then
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <a gerdoe> any potato can stay with open teeworlds server with 16 player on
20:28 < fablt> Good news for my potato!
21:04 < Dune> sounds cool, nothing to keep in touch  with friends than spamming grenades on them
21:04 < Dune> like*
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Robyt3 is amazing
22:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> I can only agree with that statement. I am in awe with how many issues the guy is fixing and how much he is contributing
