14:19 < SNAK3> My DDRace server is stuck somehow 
14:19 < SNAK3> it wont go past 
14:19 < SNAK3> [14-09-27 14:16:35][server]: version 0.6 626fce9a778df4d4
14:20 < SNAK3> I'm usng the latest DDRace mod 64bit on Ubuntu 14.04
14:27 <@minus> might be better to ask on #ddrace
15:06 < SNAK3> I allready have Thank you minus 
22:17 < pielover88888> Oi.
22:44 <@minus> aloha
22:46 < pielover88888> oh hi minus..
23:13 < Learath2> pielover88888: one question why did you come in and ask for an OpenFNG bot in the official teeworlds channel
23:14 < pielover88888> Learath2: Are we not allowed to talk about bots? also not enough people are in the Openfng room.
23:18 < Learath2> pielover88888: well aimbots are not allowed, i think there aint no rules about discussing them but i remember mtricks kicking Btxs ass for it 
23:23 < pielover88888> it's not an "aimbot" it's a human-versus-bot 4v4 OpenFNG kind of thing.
23:26 <@minus> why'd you bypass highlighting matricks and BotoX?
23:27 < pielover88888> indeed.
23:34 < Learath2> its 1 AM didnt want to bother them. 
23:34 < pielover88888> if they have it set to alert them, it's their fault.
23:35 < Learath2> someone woke me up with a hilite at the middle of the night because i fell asleep with my phone on max volume and headphones
23:35 < pielover88888> you use a phone to use IRC?
23:35 < pielover88888> also that's still your fault xD
23:44 <@minus> it's actually 11pm for them
23:45 <@minus> Learath2: that's your own faul though
23:45 <@minus> turn your phone off/into flight mode at night
23:48 < laxa> Am I allowed to make advertisement for a race challenge there ?
23:50 < heinrich5991> yes
23:51 < heinrich5991> (as far as I understand you, that is)
