11:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> As I remember correctly, there was a problem analyzing Teeworlds logs?

21:00 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> @Assa you mean parsing it?
21:08 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> It can be nasty that sometimes players can join as "(connecting)" and then suddenly have a different name https://github.com/chillavanilla/TeeworldsEconMod/issues/49
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> do you need perfect logs?
