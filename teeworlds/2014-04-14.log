03:54 < BotoX> >A would-be saboteur arrested today at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland made the bizarre claim that he was from the future. Eloi Cole, a strangely dressed young man, said that he had travelled back in time to prevent the LHC from destroying the world.

16:01 < ghost91> would be nice to see some of the stuff, that’s been done getting merged
16:01 < ghost91> (or rejected..)
16:02 <@minus> so, convinced the intern to use buildbot for continuous integration :D
16:02 < ghost91> it’s kind of difficult to develop atm, cause it’s hard to get an overwiev of what needs to be done… :P

17:37 <@minus> the files in it have an modification date of february 2010
17:37 <@minus> and there's a .svn directory
