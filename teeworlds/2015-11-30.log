01:15 < allu2> Someone should add IRC client to Teeworlds :P
01:17 <@heinrich5991> has been done before :)
01:17 <@heinrich5991> I think in the h-client for example? or the gamer client perhaps
01:17 < allu2> Then make client autojoin to some channel and add authentication at server, and suddenly we have authentication support :P
01:18 <@matricks> allu2: http://matricks.se/tw/teewars.png
01:18 < allu2> Yeah noticed from that
01:18 <@matricks> allu2: also, no
01:18 <@matricks> don't do it
01:18 < allu2> Why it got removed?
01:18 <@matricks> allu2: that isn't even the same teeworlds
01:18 < allu2> Ah, well, why not reimplement it?
01:19 < allu2> or i guess implement if it was never in there :S
01:19 <@matricks> how about a movieplayer, webbrowser and music workbench as well?
01:20 < allu2> Well I've played games with irc client inbuild also handling the authentication and its been working alright :P
01:20 < allu2> game*
01:20 <@matricks> it's about scope
01:20 < allu2> But it could help with the usability problem of joining to random servers to ask "one more for 3v3" :P
01:21 <@matricks> why?
01:21 <@matricks> use an irc client on the side
01:21 < allu2> :( but the console is already so pretty, would be shame to have to alt-tab away from the client
01:22 <@matricks> it's classic feature creeping
01:23 <@matricks> soon you are making everything but the game :)
01:24 < allu2> Hum, is there any changes in 0.7 to rcon commands?
01:24 <@matricks> dunno
01:25 < allu2> I guess I could make TeeBot do looking up of players and sending them interserver messages where TeeBot is running
01:27 < allu2> Though it might encourage people to talk between servers and just make the chat in both servers more messy then it needs to be
01:32 < koomi> matricks: steam overlay already provides a webbrowser :-P
01:33 <@matricks> for people who use that shit, yeah
01:36 <@matricks> oh well, sleepy time
01:41 < allu2> Hmm might have to start using steam.. I mean combined with glowingbear I use now it will also give me IRC :P
10:20 < Flutterbat> matricks: you here?
10:45 <@matricks> Flutterbat: yes
10:49 < Flutterbat> matricks: had some freenode issues. knew you would be on there as well. found someone else already.
10:50 <@matricks> freenode has been under DDOS attacks
10:55 < allu2> Seems one of my university servers got banned from freenode by some automatic system during that :P
11:18 < Flutterbat> matricks: i know. im getting funny error messages like
11:18 < Flutterbat> 10:14 -!- ERROR Closing Link: p30.dip0.t-ipconnect.de (Sorry, server is full - try later)
11:18 < Flutterbat> and failed ssl handshakes
11:18 < Flutterbat> its full!
11:21 < Flutterbat> yeay im in 
12:01 <@heinrich5991> "the internet is full, go away!"
12:02 <@heinrich5991> (see also: ipv4)
16:16 <@minus> hihihi, i'm connected to freenode
17:10 < Obani> minus, I can't connect to it ;(
17:20 <@matricks> heinrich5991: bah, I remember when the internet was full using modems :)
17:26 < fstd> i remember when the internet was for porn
17:59 <@matricks> what, like 5 minutes ago?
18:11 < fstd> yeah and also like 5 minutes ago
18:11 < fstd> (what i had in mind was that ridiculous WoW dance video.  or at least i think it was WoW)
18:11 < fstd> pretty old one
