00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> basically zCatch
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> >:o
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> solofng is nice
13:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> Was it normal that I'm losing contact to the Masterserver?
13:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> It seems to work for a while after I restart my Server
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> Its normal i guess, masterservers are always having some problem, any version
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> having issues as well @Trafalgar Law ?
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> at least fetching the list seems to always work fine
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> No I have no problems with the Masterservers
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I haven't heard of other people having issues with 0.7
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Why doesnt ``save_config`` overwrite the normal config file? Or is there any way to actually save the config other than closing the client.
18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `save_config` should work
18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh so it writes two files?
18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> two?
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can give it an **optional** parameter
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it will save in `%APPDATA/configs`
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i get this
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/669237339024916481/unknown.png
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> without parameters
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and when i delete configs directory nothing happens
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> > it will save in %APPDATA/configs
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> nothing happens? wdym
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nothing
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but i guess thats expected
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the folder should not be deleted
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what do you expect to happen?
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> anyways i want my config to be saved where its loaded
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> a simple fix sounds like to load it from `./teeworlds/configs`
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so when my client crashes or i exit it dirty i want my saves to get loaded agian
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so you want me to do a exec configs/a.cfg in my config?
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> or modify storage.cfg?
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its not too much about me
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i mean in general wouldnt it make sense to add some option to save the config?
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also when doing binds and editing them in file idk
19:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah I'm a bit surprised it does that too
