21:19 < necropotame> Hi keep1
21:19 < keep1> Hello
21:19 < necropotame> I've a question related to your bInfMod code. Which branch is the most up-to-date?
21:19 < keep1> how you doing ?
21:19 < keep1> no one :D
21:20 < necropotame> :(
21:20 < keep1> well, hmm bModInf branch i guess
21:20 < keep1> branch with bots
21:21 < necropotame> Do you plan to update it a little? It's for this: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12145
21:21 < keep1> but actually when i add something in one branch i try to add it in the second
21:21 < keep1> why not
21:23 < Obani> yo keep1 
21:23 < Obani> Long time no see
21:23 < Obani> Need some maps ?
21:24 < keep1> Hey Obani :) you made new ?
21:24 < Obani> Nop
21:24 < Obani> I quitted teeworlds months ago
21:24 < Obani> But I can still make maps if you contact me
21:25 < Obani> I turned to the real side of quake
21:30 < keep1> Obani: thanks for proposal, i'll tell you if i need
21:30 < necropotame> keep1, you should maybe remove zombie explosion on self kill
21:30 < Obani> keep1, actually I had made a map that you never added
21:30 < Obani> it was inf_warehouse_summer's last version
21:32 < keep1> necropotame: i know, it's controversed "feature", i long time hesitated to remove it
21:32 < keep1> Obani: i'm not 100% sure :/
21:32 < necropotame> Keep it, but check if the zombie dies using the kill command before
21:33 < Obani> keep1, I am
21:33 < Obani> https://github.com/MinetestForFun/xorhub-serverscontents/tree/master/SRV-FPS/teeworlds/TeeWorlds_infclass/data/maps
21:33 < keep1> Obani: oh i just understood :D send it to me :)
21:33 < keep1> Obani: thaaaaanks
21:33 < Obani> It's totally different
21:33 < Obani> So I don't know
21:34 < Obani> tell me if you try it now, I might come
21:34 < keep1> Obani: yep later, i gonna cook
21:34 < keep1> necropotame: i did not understand
21:35 < necropotame> I like that zombies explode. But if seems that players don't like when one play like a boomer
21:36 < necropotame> I've got banned like this :P
21:37 < necropotame> The only problem seems to be when you die on purpose. So you can check if the zombie dies using cl_kill, or if he just dies because of wall/death tiles/0 hearts
21:37 < Obani> necropotame, I think bModInf is good in the fact that it let's users free
21:37 < necropotame> And disable the explosion in the first case
21:37 < keep1> necropotame: aaah yes i understood
21:38 < keep1> necropotame: hmmm
21:38 < necropotame> Obani, yes, but it's not clear if boomer style is fair or not
21:39 < necropotame> I've created InfClass because I got bored of being banned for that :D
21:39 < keep1> necropotame: i thought i openned an issue for this, but seems like no
21:40 < keep1> necropotame: oh yes i did
21:40 < keep1> https://bitbucket.org/gwilherm/infection/issues/4/allow-only-izombie-to-explode-on-selfkill
21:41 < keep1> i openned it 1 year ago.... someone here is quite lazy
21:41 < necropotame> lol
21:41 < necropotame> I've not checked the issues, sorry
21:42 < keep1> i don't blame you :D
21:43 < necropotame> :)
21:44 < necropotame> Btw, bInfMod players/you rejected my maps, or you just forget about it?
21:44 < necropotame> Just to have some feedback, to know if there is something to improve
21:45 < keep1> actually i had only 1 answer ^^
21:45 < necropotame> I would like that InfClass maps are compatible with all infection-like mods (at least for the simples ones)
21:46 < keep1> i think i should just add them and see
21:46 < keep1> make some stats
21:46 < necropotame> The new format is compatible with the vanilla editor
21:47 < keep1> but the more i add maps the more i see vote-wars
21:47 < necropotame> That's why I've switched to map rotation :D
21:47 < keep1> yes i saw
21:47 < necropotame> Try just with infc_skull
21:47 < keep1> okay
21:47 < necropotame> Maybe infc_damascus
21:47 < keep1> i'll add it and see
21:48 < necropotame> The others are maybe not balanced for only engineers
21:48 < keep1> Zaby also asked me if i want to add his new maps
21:48 < necropotame> I don't know him
21:48 < keep1> he made the maps for the first russian infclass 64p
21:49 < keep1> but he made again huge maps
21:49 < necropotame> InfClass with 64 players?
21:49 < keep1> yes
21:49 < necropotame> Since when there such a fork?
21:50 < keep1> it was before your Infclass
21:50 < Obani> I coul make mmo maps for that
21:50 < Obani> could*
21:50 < necropotame> OK, you are talking about infection, not InfClass
21:51 < keep1> i don't remember the name of the mod
21:51 < keep1> it was infection with classes and 64 players made by browed
21:52 < necropotame> I saw some infection mid with 64 slots, but based on DDNet
21:52 < necropotame> I always die in freeze zone, and never from infected :P
21:52 < keep1> yes coffee's infz ?
21:54 < necropotame> Dunno
21:55 < keep1> on ddnet network, infectionZ is mod by a french modder coffee
21:56 < necropotame> I would say also that adding +3 to the score when a zombie infect a human could be more fair
21:56 < keep1> ah ?
21:57 < necropotame> It's how it works in InfClass. Since it's hard to infect, the reward should be better
21:57 < keep1> hmmm yes why not
22:03 < keep1> well i have to open some new issues then 
22:05 < necropotame> M
22:05 < necropotame> True, it will be helpful in one year :D
22:05 < keep1> delete client and editor, /about command, score +3 when zombie
22:05 < keep1> necropotame: :D
22:05 < keep1> eeeeeh i'll try to find time to this
22:06 < necropotame> Just merge this branch
22:06 < necropotame> https://github.com/teeworldsmods/teeworlds/tree/tw06server
22:07 < necropotame> It will remove the client/editor and make it compatible with bam 0.5.0
22:07 < keep1> cool
22:07 < keep1> thaaaanks
22:08 < necropotame> It will remove your readme also, so you have to check it ^^
22:08 <@heinrich5991> does git merge work if the deletion removes modified files?
22:08 <@heinrich5991> I'd guess it'll create a merge conflict in that case
22:09 < necropotame> Depends if the order, I guess
22:10 < keep1> why do i use mercurial ? :D
22:10 < necropotame> Didn't though about that. Sorry :D
22:11 < keep1> actually i use mercurial because i forked it from Orangus mod and he was using mercurial
22:11 < necropotame> heinrich, I've only tested it for DummyCapture. There was a lot of conflict, but not related to deleted files.
22:11 < necropotame> If you have a github account, it would be easier. Most of teeworlds mods are here
22:13 < keep1> yes you're probably right
22:13 < necropotame> In particular for issues, so players don't have to create a second account 
22:17 < keep1> and i almost created the repo on gitlab :D
22:18 < necropotame> Never tested this one :)
22:19 < keep1> hosted on https://framagit.org
22:21 < necropotame> Seems nice
22:22 < necropotame> I hope that framasoft will be able to continue to host all those servers
22:22 < keep1> i hope too
22:23 < necropotame> They said that it's more or less limited in time because it's mainly to demonstrate that an alternative is possible
22:24 < keep1> too bad :(
22:24 < keep1> but i understand it's much work 
22:24 < keep1> and money
23:19 < necropotame> keep1, there is also a branch "chatcmd" in the github link. It contains the /about cmd. Do you have custom commands, or you just drop what start by / to avoid spam?
23:20 < keep1> I just have whisper command and drop all unknown commands
23:35 < necropotame> OK.
23:35 < necropotame> I've to create a branch whisper too
23:46 < keep1> :o
23:53 < necropotame> I'm trying to create a branch for each useful piece of code for teeworlds
23:54 < necropotame> That way, to create a mod, you just have to merge branches and tweak the gameplay
23:56 < keep1> nice work
23:59 < keep1> it will be like plugins ^^
