08:33 <@minus> guenstigwerben: seems i forgot changing the cert there, fixed
14:54 < nameless_tee37> hello?
14:55 < nameless_tee37> any chance at talking to a developer?
14:55 <@heinrich5991> hi
14:55 <@heinrich5991> ask your question, maybe someone knows the answer
14:56 < nameless_tee37> It doesnt directly relate to the game, so i doubt it, it's more of a legal thingy
14:57 < nameless_tee37> i'm developing a game and I'm adding a little easter egg with a nod to every game we played during development, and tee worlds is one of these, I just wanted to know what the devs' stance was on this, it'd just be a small nod in the form of the classic teeworlds character painted on a wall
14:59 <@heinrich5991> that sounds totally fine
15:00 <@heinrich5991> and it looks like it's entirely within the range of the license as well (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib_License)
15:03 < nameless_tee37> awesome!
15:03 < nameless_tee37> thanks for your answer :)
15:03 < nameless_tee37> I'll shoot them an email just to let them know
15:03 < nameless_tee37> cheers!
15:04 <@heinrich5991> what kind of game are you developing?
15:07 < nameless_tee37> it's a plateformer adventure game called Fossil Echo :)
15:07 < nameless_tee37> www.fossilecho.com if you want to check it out
15:07 < nameless_tee37> not anything like teeworlds though!
15:37 < nameless_tee37> Thanks again! Cheers
16:23 <@matricks> heinrich5991: got the mail, just said got a head :)
16:24 <@heinrich5991> ah. great :)
16:25 <@matricks> we are gonna get some keys for the game as well
16:25 <@matricks> dunno how to distribute those :D
