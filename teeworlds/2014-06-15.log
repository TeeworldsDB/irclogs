19:00 < heinrich5991> this is why I'd like triple buffering
19:01 < heinrich5991> to not having to tell people 'turn off vsync if you want to reduce the latency'
19:26 <@minus> heinrich5991: add it then
19:26 <@minus> shouldn't be much, assuming the driver supports it
19:27 < heinrich5991> given unlimited time :P
19:27 < heinrich5991> but yeah, I could look into that
19:27 <@minus> it's probably a oneliner
20:24 < uChar]]> hi! one question... teewords don't accept donations anymore?
20:30 < Shahan_> Hello, guys
20:30 <@minus> good evening
20:30 < Shahan_> I'm trying to build Teeworlds for Win64
20:30 < Shahan_> windows 8.1
20:30 < Shahan_> i have both VS 2012 and VS 2013 installed
20:31 <@minus> uChar]]: we currently have no use for further donations
20:31 < Shahan_> but I can't build bam for winx64
20:31 < Shahan_> that's output http://pastebin.com/JafJ2q1c
20:32 < Shahan_> as the output says, I need something else to build bam and teeworlds
20:32 <@minus> you don't need to build bam as 64bit btw
20:32 < Shahan_> does anybody knows, what else should I install for bam?
20:32 <@minus> did you do vsvarsall x64?
20:32 < Shahan_> not yet
20:33 < Shahan_> doyou want me to try>
20:33 < Shahan_> t?
20:35 < Shahan_> I guess you mean vcvarsall.bat amd64
20:37 < uChar]]> minus and how maintenence servers?
20:39 < uChar]]> if not too much to ask :\
20:41 <@minus> Kottizen hosts, i maintain
20:41 < Shahan_> minus: it's strange, I hardcoded my VS path, and now bam built without errors. Should I report about it anywhere?
20:42 <@minus> if you feel that it is an error
20:44 < Shahan_> minus: btw, as far as I remember, you are not the code developer. Who is the code developer now?
20:44 < uChar]]> minus thanks for answering :)
20:44 < uChar]]> Shahan_:  oy no?
20:45 < Shahan_> uChar]]: not looks like
20:45 < EastByte> Shahan_: Oy is the code maintainer (not really active though)
20:45 < Shahan_> (not really active though)
20:45 < Shahan_> right, that what I'm about
20:47 < uChar]]> What is the name of Oy in teeworlds forum?
20:47 < uChar]]> ups.. bad words.. sory for my bad engliush
20:56 <@minus> oy is oy
20:56 <@minus> !seen oy
20:56 < Nimda3> I've last seen Oy 49 days, 21 minutes and 27 seconds ago in #teeworlds saying "minus: about your bam.lua update - i'm not sure what to do with sdl/freetype on windows".
20:58 < uChar]]> xD
20:58 < BeaR_> !seen oy_
20:58 < Nimda3> I've last seen Oy_ 81 days, 22 hours, 54 minutes and 39 seconds ago in #teeworlds saying "you need a permission from court if one is 16 other one has to be at least 18".
20:58 < BeaR_> hmm
21:01 < Shahan_> !wtf freetype
21:01 < Nimda3> Freestylin online via facebook or AIM w/e.. You just type like you would speak in a freestyle and dont take too long or edit your lines just let it flow.
21:01 < Nimda3> Example: .. freetype
21:02 < Shahan_> !choose Oy or Oy_
21:02 < Nimda3> Shahan_: Oy_
21:02 < Shahan_> ^^
21:02 <@minus> stop it
21:02 < uChar]]> ?? what do choose?
21:03 < Shahan_> minus: you wrote that I don't need to use Bam x64
21:03 < Shahan_> minus: but my Teeworlds "hangs" oftenly :(
21:04 < Shahan_> actually, my problem described here: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10823
21:05 < Shahan_> I suggested a wrong solution
21:05 < Shahan_> DDRace client hangs too
21:16 < heinrich5991> has someone worked with the threaded graphics stack and can tell me what KickCommandBuffer does?
21:17 < heinrich5991> Shahan_: does it still hang with SDL2?
21:17 < Shahan_> heinrich5991: ohi
21:17 < heinrich5991> hi :)
21:17 < Shahan_> heinrich5991: I didn't try SDL2 
21:17 < heinrich5991> ok
21:17 < heinrich5991> what does the hang look like
21:17 < heinrich5991> have you tried to debug it?
21:17 < heinrich5991> can you still switch windows?
21:18 < Shahan_> no, I don't know how to debug on windows:(
21:18 < Shahan_> cmd.exe doesn't know gdb --args :)
21:19 < Shahan_> I heard Teeworlds 0.7 will use SDL 2 only
21:19 < Shahan_> Are there any amateur projects that made Teeworlds 0.6.2 work with SDL 2?
21:21 < heinrich5991> to debug on windows you'd need msvc
21:21 < heinrich5991> about sdl2, not sure
21:31 < Shahan_> yes, i have msvc
21:32 < Shahan_> i just don't understand why matricks added 64 bit support to bam if it doesn't work?
21:40 < heinrich5991> sushi successfully compiled for amd64 on windows
21:41 <@minus> also, we have a 64bit windows download
21:43 < Shahan_> it was magic
21:44 < Shahan_> well, I give up for today
21:44 < Shahan_> anyways, thanks for help
21:44 < Shahan_> bb all :)
