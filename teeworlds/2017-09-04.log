16:26 < daey> teeworld in 144hz is like a totally new experience o.o
16:26 <@minus> heh
16:27 <@heinrich5991> 144hz screen?
16:33 <@minus> what's there to question?
16:33 <@minus> 144hz monitors do exist
16:34 <@heinrich5991> I was wondering whether the 144hz was referring to a screen or something else
16:34 <@heinrich5991> maybe audio output or something
16:34 <@minus> i wonder why it's 144. it's a multiple of 24 at least
16:39 < daey> i think its 144 because 144/2 and 144/4 are usable
16:40 < daey> well or maybe that doesnt make sense :^)
16:47 < daey> its also cleanly dividable by 3.
16:48 <@heinrich5991> it's 12^2
16:48 <@heinrich5991> it's divisible by a lot of numbers
16:48 < daey> yeah. but everything >4 doesnt make much sense because sub 30fps its going to look terrible anyways
16:48 <@heinrich5991> 15 numbers to be exact :)
16:50 < daey> how did you know its 15? is there a trick to it?
16:51 <@heinrich5991> you can check which prime numbers are in there
16:52 <@heinrich5991> since it's 12*12, we can easily factor it to 2*2*3 * 2*2*3, so 2^4 * 3^2
16:52 <@heinrich5991> and then each divisor must have a subset of these prime factors
16:52 <@heinrich5991> we have 4 twos and 2 threes
16:53 <@heinrich5991> how many different divisors can we build from these? there are 5 possibilities to choose the number of twos (0,1,2,3,4) and 3 possibilities for the number of threes (0,1,2)
16:53 <@heinrich5991> thus, we have 5*3 possibilities for all divisors
16:54 < daey> interesting
17:27 <+matricks> math y0!
17:29 < deen> also 144 is divisble by 24, so you can watch movies perfectly
17:30 < deen> oh, minus said that, nevermind
17:53 < daey> dont they have 24.xxx fps?
17:59 < deen> daey: 23.976 with NTSC frame rates
18:06 <@minus> It's a huge improvement over 60Hz for that
