22:56 < Funni2> is there a version 0.6.3 for 64 Bit in sight?
22:57 <@heinrich5991> linux 64 bit?
22:58 <@heinrich5991> Funni2: most likely your linux distribution has it in the package manager anyway
22:58 < Funni2> oh no i mean windows
22:59 < Funni2> i have a ! in front of many servers because i am using 0.6.3 64
22:59 < Funni2> and i love a "clear screen" :)
23:00 <@heinrich5991> ! indicates 32 bit or what?
23:01 < Funni2> no the ! in indicates 0.6.2 server (different versions) i mean
23:02 < Funni2> but i am not sure. i don't have tw installed on this box
23:03 <@heinrich5991> I think ! indicates a custom server, but I could be wrong
23:03 <@heinrich5991> but 0.6.2 have known vulnerabilities
23:03 <@heinrich5991> *has
23:05 < Funni2> in the client-version on windows 64 too?
23:06 < Funni2> wir k√∂nnen auch deutsch reden falls dir das grammatikalisch lieber sit :)
23:11 <@heinrich5991> ah no
23:12 <@heinrich5991> client version of 0.6.2 and 0.6.3 are not really different
