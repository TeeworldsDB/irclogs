18:35 < luca> If I want to connect to my lan server (non registered), possible to take the IP of my pc+port so eg 12.3.456.12:8303?
18:36 < Henningstone> if it's running on the computer from that you want to connect, just do localhost
18:36 < luca> no, I mean for other people
18:37 < Henningstone> ah ok, I misunderstood. Go to for example wieistmeineip.de, that will show your the ip that your friends need to connect to
18:37 < luca> i tried, but not rlly working
18:37 < Henningstone> did you open the ports?
18:37 < luca> server runs on port 8303 so i did myip:8303 - nothing
18:37 < EastByte> *forward :p
18:38 < Henningstone> luca: you need to *forward the udp port 8303 in your router then; did you do that?
18:38 < luca> Sure...but I don't know why it is not working
18:38 < luca> It doesn't registers @ master
18:39 < luca> But, no errors ocuring
