18:18 < Obani> heinrich5991, is there  problem with the masterserver ?
18:21 < EastByte> yup, master4 is currently being attacked
21:16 < quatria> why do people attack master servers? what is the reason?
21:18 < Learath2> obv compensating for something....
21:25 <@matricks> quatria: people who can't create, destroy
21:27 < quatria> i can understand when you attack for example a rival business so more customers come to you and you earn more money, but an open source free to play game? You gain nothing from attacking that
21:27 <@matricks> well, people kill each other over who has the better imaginary friend, go figure
21:31 < Learath2> quatria:  when someone hurts their feelings instead of taking it they just ddos to show who is the "boss"
21:33 < Learath2> had an encounter with a similar mentally challanged person last night on ddnet
21:48 < quatria> but who are they hurting with that? Mostly the new people that come to the game, others have favorite server list. So you are most likely not attacking the person you want by ddosing master4
21:49 < Obani> Ok so that was really a ddos
21:49 < quatria> idk
21:49 < Obani> Actually, it being incomplete it made me rediscover some mods I had forgotten
21:49 < Obani> Are there several master servers ?
21:49 < necropotame> Yes
21:50 < Obani> I mean is the one used for teeworlds vanilla dispatched in several pieces ?
21:50 < Obani> (a bit like an irc server ?)
21:50 <@heinrich5991> yes
21:50 < Obani> That's why
21:51 < necropotame> minus, I'm starting to spread unique_ptr in all my programs. It's magic. Thanks for the advice
21:51 <@minus> :D
21:51 <@matricks> well, irc servers know about each other, the teeworlds masters doesn't
21:52 <@minus> i put a raw pointer in my code today. but it's non-owning, the owner has a unique_ptr to it and the lifetime is guaranteed, so it's okay
21:52 <@minus> what's with all this chattery here
21:53 < Obani> Yeah, kinda unusual
21:53 < Obani> You just need a ddos to revive a channel
21:53 < necropotame> Maybe it's one of us that I'd bored :D
21:53 < necropotame> is*
21:54 < Obani> lol
21:54 < Obani> In fact it was all part of my plan
21:55 < Obani> Dropping DDOSs on games I follow on IRC to revive their network
21:55 < Obani> hehehe
21:57 < quatria> i think the person/s who are ddosing are also reading this, it makes sense right? 
21:58 < Obani> No
21:58 < Obani> It could be a random chinese of russian on the other side of the world
21:58 < Obani> Happends often
22:00 < Stitch627> not in teeworlds
22:00 < Obani> it does
22:00 < Obani> If it happends often in a random palce and it already happend sometimes in teeworlds
22:00 < quatria> ok maybe, but if i would ddos i would like to see the reaction of the people, i would like to see them complaining and being pissed
22:01 < Obani> quatria, DDOS can be a political attack
22:01 < Obani> Or many other things
22:01 < quatria> lol
22:01 < Obani> It's not only a kikoo thing
22:01 < Obani> It's the simpler attack
22:01 < quatria> so you are saying a nation is ddosing teeworlds? :D
22:01 < Obani> And the most hard to get rid off
22:01 < Obani> quatria, obviously
22:02 < Obani> quatria, there's a website that does a cartography of ddos attacks
22:02 < Obani> in real time
22:02 < Obani> I thin it's http://map.norsecorp.com/
22:02 < Obani> If you think that cyberwar is a joke
22:03 < Obani> Well you should think norml war is too
22:03 < Obani> normal*
22:03 < quatria> so you are saying they are not aiming for teeworlds but it affects it too? ("accidently")
22:04 < Obani> quatria, no
22:04 < Obani> quatria, I just say that the reason for a cyber-attack can be way more than a simple kikoo that downloaded a software
22:05 < Obani> And also, the attack of a service can turn back on every of it's users
22:05 < Obani> BACK
22:05 < Obani> back*
22:06 < Obani> quatria, let's take an example
22:06 < quatria> welcome back
22:06 < Obani> Some months ago, one of the largest DNSs services got attacked
22:06 < Obani> Which made it be unavailable for some days
22:06 < Obani> or hours, I don't remember
22:07 < Obani> Well, every website that was using it, (and that's a lot, even of the largest ones), got their dns unusable
22:07 < Obani> Which means that you couldn't type github.com to go on Github
22:07 < Obani> Nowadays, nobody connects a website with its IP
22:07 < Obani> So this was kinda effective
22:08 < EastByte> effective in order to make the tw git repo unavailable, well planned
22:08 < quatria> damn
22:09 < Obani> EastByte, I think that was the main goal indeed
22:09 < Obani> They are nasty
22:09 < quatria> took down a big dns service only to harm teeworlds... these people...
22:09 < Obani> Teeworlds is a major strategic point
22:09 < Obani> Well I don't get why you guys don't get in fact
22:10 < quatria> and we have to hold it! not for us, or any other selfish reason, but for everyone on this planet !
