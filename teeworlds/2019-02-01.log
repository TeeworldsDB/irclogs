19:44 < TeeSlayer> is it possible to modify the alternative broadcast position? like "wait for next round" or "game starts in" etc
19:44 < TeeSlayer> as a server
19:46 < TeeSlayer> ehm, not position, but text
19:46 < TeeSlayer> "wait for next round" doesn't really fit with my mod
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the text displayed in the middle of the screen is a client-side thing that cannot be messed with (hence the separation with the lower part broadcast)
20:52 < TeeSlayer> would be cool if that was possible :>
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think the idea is to separate trustful broadcast and server-sided messages
20:57 < TeeSlayer> is not being able to modify k/d part of that trust plan?^^
20:59 <@Dune> modify it how?
21:00 < TeeSlayer> well if people come into the game, kd is always 0 for everybody - as an example
21:01 < TeeSlayer> for the trustful broadcast: I'm using deadspec in a way that doesn't want players to wait for the next round
21:01 < TeeSlayer> rather "turn"
21:23 < day> was the collision reworked in the new version?
21:24 < day> i remember that once you crossed a certain speed you could kind of blurr through tees
21:24 < day> *something i liked* :P
21:29 < day> whats also super odd is how slow teeworlds looks in replays
21:41 <@Dune> blurr through tees?
21:41 <@Dune> you mean skip a deathtile?
21:41 < day> as in the collision wasnt registered
21:42 <@Dune> TeeSlayer, the k/d is completely unrelated to that
21:42 < day> maybe it's ping related, im playing on 20ms servers atm
21:46 < day> btw. was there ever a discussion about pistol reloading while it is stashed? I think that would be very nice
21:48 <@Dune> I think so too but I don't think the gameplay team agrees :P
21:48 < day> who is the gameplay team?
21:49 < day> *i need names, adresses and daily schedules*
21:50 < day> i can see the appeal to keep it how it is to motivate switching, but the reloading is so tedious slow, maybe the reload should be twice as fast after you havent shot for a few seconds so that you can reload it quicker
21:51 < day> aside from 1on1 it's a one shot wonder imho. empty it once and forget about it
22:07 <@Dune> yeah I agree
22:07 <@Dune> another solution is just to increase the regen speed
22:08 < day> see my 2nd last line :p
22:08 <@Dune> ah sorry :)
22:08 < day> i think it would be wrong to perma up the regen rate, that would make it too strong
22:13 < TeeSlayer> Dune: K/D is just another thing the server has no control over.
22:13 <@Dune> because it's not in the protocol
22:13 < TeeSlayer> But it should have. Just my opinion.
22:13 < TeeSlayer> yeah
22:35 <@Dune> well, it would have been done if someone did it :P
22:44 < rand> I'm not sure why K/D is this relevant. Usually, I check the score of the opponent to get an idea about how strong he is
22:45 < rand> and if I join a game, it's fine to compare to other players on K/D on the same time span
23:28 <@Dune> K/D is more relevant than score when you join in-between
