11:52 < ChillerDragon> can some1 explain me this code thank
11:53 < ChillerDragon> i see a if statement and a teneary with the same condition
11:53 < ChillerDragon> check if m_ClShowsocial is set
11:54 < ChillerDragon> if it is set print `pMsg->m_pDescription` if it is not set copy `pMsg->m_pDescription` into `aName` and then print `aName` 
11:54 < ChillerDragon> i dont get it
11:55 < ChillerDragon> Isnt `aName` either unset or the exact same as `pMsg->m_pDescription` at all times?
11:56 < bridge> <d_une> if showsocial = 0, Name is not unset, it is equal to the value of Description
11:57 < bridge> <d_une> if showsocial = 1, we use `pMsg->m_pDescription` straight up
11:57 < bridge> <d_une> is that equivalent to just using `pMsg->m_pDescription`? looks like it to me
11:58 < ChillerDragon> ye so it either uses pDescription directly or copies it first into a buffer
11:58 < ChillerDragon> whats the purpose?
11:59 < bridge> <robyt3> agreed, I think it was supposed to be something like `Config()->m_ClShowsocial ? pMsg->m_pDescription : ""` so it hides the player name with showsocial = 0
11:59 < ChillerDragon> drunk tw devs
11:59 < bridge> <d_une> so many nonsense redundant options anyway, an artefact of diplomatic collaborative development :D
12:00 < bridge> <robyt3> Would have been better to introduce some placeholder names like the bots in counter strike instead of hiding the names completely though
12:00 < bridge> <d_une> we at least escaped having player IDs on everyone by default...
12:00 < ChillerDragon> that was a thing for some releases wasnt it?
12:03 < ChillerDragon> I cba to open another pr i already have 9 pending
12:03 < ChillerDragon> robsti u still into fixing vani stuff?
12:05 < bridge> <robyt3> Not on teeworlds recently
12:05 < bridge> <robyt3> You could open an issue or add it to that one "issues with the code" issue so at least it's not forgotten entirely
12:14 < bridge> <d_une> only was a thing for the 0.7.0
12:15 < ChillerDragon> ok done robsti
12:18 < ChillerDragon> btw @heinrich5991 you could mark "Why is Sv_Broadcast gone?" as completed in this issue https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1120
