00:00 < foxlet> Pathos: Two in Frankfurt, One in Iowa (new), Two in Virginia, and one that’s not usually used in Singapore.
00:02 < Pathos> Wait a minute... all AWS?
00:03 < foxlet> Pathos: No.
00:03 < foxlet> Pathos: The 2 Virginia ones are hosted by my own, Frankfurt is on DO, and Iowa is on GCE.
00:03 < foxlet> Singapore is on DO too.
00:38 < ***> Buffer Playback...
00:38 < foxlet> [00:13:35] Pathos: I only started Iowa to better capture both users on west (California, Washington) and east (New York, Virginia).
00:38 < foxlet> [00:13:50] Pathos: So it mostly does load balancy operations from Virginia.
00:38 < Pathos> [00:14:04] Ah I see
00:38 < foxlet> [00:14:33] I also run DOOM and Starmade servers off of it.
00:38 < Pathos> [00:14:39] Hahaha
00:38 < Pathos> [00:15:00] 1 gbps -- runs Doom server
00:38 < Pathos> [00:15:13] That's nice
00:38 < Pathos> [00:15:38] I guess you play those?
00:38 < foxlet> [00:15:47] Pathos: You can try it if you want, it just copies userdata from Virginia to Iowa.
00:38 < foxlet> [00:15:57] Pathos: Yes, I do.
00:38 < foxlet> [00:16:43] IRC also runs off Frankfurt, although I don’t think text needs 1Gbps.
00:38 < Pathos> [00:17:20] Oh, I thought it's in Virginia
00:38 < Pathos> [00:17:26] That Iowa offer is very tempting haha
00:38 < Pathos> [00:18:49] I'm currently looking for UK host though and I've been hesitant to sign up for DO because I hear about some inconsistency
00:38 < foxlet> [00:19:28] Pathos: Your current instance are on the Virginia boxes.
00:38 < Pathos> [00:19:38] Right
00:38 < Pathos> [00:20:03] Oh what the hey, I'll try the Iowa one too haha
00:38 < Pathos> [00:20:48] Ports 8303-8305 should be more than enough :)
00:38 < foxlet> [00:25:15] Pathos: Actually, Frankfurt was picked because it makes having a server in the UK essentially redundant. https://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4474223017
00:38 < heinrich5991> [00:26:05] Pathos: thanks for the maps again, quite a few new ones :)
00:38 < Pathos> [00:26:21] heinrich5991: NP at all
00:38 < Pathos> [00:26:31] foxlet: I don't understand, those are your pings?
00:38 < foxlet> [00:27:10] Pathos: Those are pings from EU-1, the primary Frankfurt server, to another box in London.
00:38 < Pathos> [00:28:47] I see, I thought you lived in Frankfurt or something haha
00:38 < foxlet> [00:29:05] Pathos: No, I live in the U.S.
00:38 < Pathos> [00:29:53] Actually, can you copy the files to your Frankfurt server as well?
00:38 < Pathos> [00:29:58] I thought so haha
00:38 < foxlet> [00:29:59] Pathos: The servers are placed to get the best coverage/ping across the widest amount of people.
00:38 < Pathos> [00:30:09] Ah of course
00:38 < foxlet> [00:30:43] Which takes quite a lot of strategic planning and coordination with the various datacenters that host it.
00:38 < foxlet> [00:31:11] It’s time consuming, but it works out nicely.
00:38 < Pathos> [00:32:08] Maximizing efficiency for Doom I see
00:38 < foxlet> [00:32:46] Pathos: Well, the server also hosts maps for Doom, some mods at 80MB+.
00:38 < foxlet> [00:32:57] Pathos: Those are downloaded when you join via Doomseeker.
00:38 < Pathos> [00:34:33] Haha my HDD capacity I had when I had Doom was 100MB or something
00:38 < Pathos> [00:35:04] This also works on your PowerPC as well?
00:38 < foxlet> [00:35:37] Pathos: Yes, they all compile just fine on it.
00:38 < foxlet> [00:36:48] Pathos: Oh, if you’re going to copy to Frankfurt it’ll take a few hours since movescript has to allocate data for it.
00:38 < Pathos> [00:37:13] What other projects do you have for the PowerPC?
00:38 < Pathos> [00:37:19] Okay NP
00:38 < Pathos> [00:37:49] Also, did you get TW to work on PowerPC?
00:38 < ***> Playback Complete.
00:39 < foxlet> Pathos: Yes, I managed to compile the server component on it.
00:39 < foxlet> Pathos: It was interesting since the PPC libraries didn’t exist for it yet, I had to compiled those too.
00:40 < foxlet> Pathos: I’m guessing that Florida one is yours?
00:41 < Pathos> Ooh, how was performance with the server?
00:41 < Pathos> PPC libraries from scratch?
00:42 < Pathos> Yes and Chicago is my Raspi
00:43 < foxlet> Pathos: It’s about the same as the Core2 and the Xeon tests.
00:43 < foxlet> Pathos: Your Florida box is giving me 80-120ms from my end.
00:44 < Pathos> Oh interesting, I thought performance would be slightly different because of the architecture; I guess wrong
00:44 < Pathos> Well, not just architecture, but just an old one
00:45 < Pathos> People from South America get lower ping than that foxlet !
00:45 < Pathos> That's actually the reason why I got the Florida server, so that NA and SA can play with decent pings haha
00:45 < Pathos> Chile, Venezuela get 60 ping to it, which is pretty nice I think
00:45 < Pathos> Wait, maybe not Chile
00:45 < foxlet> I wonder how well it goes from Iowa.
00:46 < Pathos> Iowa is probably good for connecting Canada and Mexico
00:46 < foxlet> I get 45ms from my end.
00:47 < foxlet> The issue with SA I find is that not many developed datacenters are there, so there are no mass-lines goings towards it.
00:47 < Pathos> Yes, especially some embargo policies going around as well, which just infuriates me
00:48 < Pathos> Even Brazil has issues internally in terms of infrastructure
00:48 < Pathos> Some get 250 ping to each other
00:49 < foxlet> Pathos: Although, I did play DOOM with someone in Bolivia while on Iowa, around 150ms.
00:49 < Pathos> Oh
00:49 < foxlet> I’ve never heard of hostdime though.
00:49 < Pathos> Bolivia to Iowa 150 is actually really impressive
00:50 < Pathos> Yeah, Hostdime doesn't really have any cheap plans, but I contacted a guy that used to work for Hostdime. Hostdime gave him a little cut of their server.
00:51 < Pathos> That's the one with 60 ping to Venezuela etc.
00:51 < foxlet> Pathos: I’m guessing they’re not on a massline though.
00:51 < foxlet> Or another large backbone.
00:52 < Pathos> I don't know what massline is, but I think I remember having a discussion about some infrastructure
00:52 < Pathos> Don't remember the details
00:53 < Pathos> They should be connected to the overseas cables though
00:53 < Pathos> Would difficult to explain the ping if they weren't
00:53 < foxlet> Pathos: It’s just my term for larger routing centers, most datacenters end up carried on larger backbones such as Google’s central backbone in California.
00:53 < foxlet> Or on Level3.
00:53 < Pathos> I understand
00:54 < Pathos> How do you find out?
00:54 < foxlet> Pathos: Traceroute.
00:54 < Pathos> Oh!
00:54 < Pathos> And any reference/cheat sheet of the backbones
00:54 < Pathos> ?
00:55 < foxlet> Pathos: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone#Modern_backbone
00:55 < foxlet> Pathos: I keep my own though.
00:55 < Pathos> Danke schon
00:55 < Pathos> Your own backbone?
00:56 < Pathos> Or reference?
00:56 < foxlet> Pathos: Reference.
00:56 < foxlet> Pathos: If I did have a backbone, I’d be an ISP.
00:57 < foxlet> Pathos: But usually it’s the likes of MCI, Telia, Level3, CenturyLink, Vodafone, AT&T, Google, Verizon, Sprint/PCS.
00:57 < foxlet> 6/9 are ISPs.
00:57 < Pathos> 6/9?
00:57 < foxlet> 6 out of 9.
01:00 < Pathos> Well backbone doesn't have to be a big network... right? Thought you built your own in your town or something maybe haha
01:00 < Pathos> Silly ideas
01:02 < foxlet> Pathos: Well, I guess you could call a local one a backbone.
01:02 < foxlet> Pathos: It still needs lots to invest, and a lot of red tape in some local govs.
01:03 < Pathos> But not something like Meshnet right?
01:03 < Pathos> Though not necessarily backbone
01:04 < foxlet> Pathos: Meshnet really isn’t so much of a backbone, since there is no “central” location where lots of data can pass through at once.
01:05 < foxlet> Pathos: The exchange is random/routed through the shortest path, which may be slower/not apt for lots of daa.
01:05 < foxlet> *data
01:06 < Pathos> There could be one data center, though I'm not sure if that's feasible wirelessly, right?
01:07 < foxlet> Pathos: That would be hub and spoke, not meshnet.
01:07 < Pathos> Ooh
01:09 < foxlet> Pathos: Meshnet is solely decentralized.
01:11 < Pathos> I see, that's true
01:11 < Pathos> Spoke and hub network is good to know
01:16 < Pathos> What do I need to know to set up a small spoke and hub network in a building or a block or something?
01:16 < Pathos> Oop
22:02 < unnamed_tee> I'm looking into translation of Teeworlds, but I can't find where to start.
22:03 < unnamed_tee> I've seen the Transifex project, the teeworlds-translations repo, and the teeworlds/datasrc/languages dir, but I have no clue which one is used.
22:06 < BotoX> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-translation
22:06 < BotoX> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=7655
22:07 < BotoX> oh oop, linked the old thread, here you go: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10929
22:07 < unnamed_tee> Okay, thank you.
22:07 < unnamed_tee> Is their a way for me to request Esperanto?
22:08 < unnamed_tee> *there
22:08 < BotoX> in the forum probably
22:08 < BotoX> or heinrich5991 might be able to help you
22:14 < unnamed_tee> heinrich5991: Any way I can get Esperanto added on Transifex?
