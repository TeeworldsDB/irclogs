14:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> Hi! Guys, can you tell me if there's any restriction due to code modification in the case of core game modes? Can I modify the code, that doesn't change gameplay and still be allowed as e.g. CTF server? Or I do have to change the name
14:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> you can check masterban list
14:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> there are a lot of server with modified vanilla
14:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> there are a lot of servers with modified vanilla
14:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> ahhh
14:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> you arent changing gameplay
14:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> so i think yes you can
14:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Savander no, you can't
14:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> Yea, I don't want to change gameplay, but need to make few changes due to my needs.
14:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> CTF-broadcasting servers must behave exactly like an unmodified server
14:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> @Savander you want to refactor base code? ðŸ‘€
14:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> Okay, so I will use econ then ðŸ™‚
14:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> If it still exists, I wasn't here for a while.. ðŸ˜„
14:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> still exists!
14:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> Not exactly refactor, but need to collect some data
14:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> for website
14:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> (welcome back)
14:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> heh
14:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> It would be much easier to do from code, than from other sources
14:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> But it's doable so, I don't want to break the restrictions ðŸ˜›
14:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> status.tw 2.0 with advanced statistics about player :)
14:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> Meeh, not really
14:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> ^.^
14:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think status.tw is already great, it would be a shame to rebuild anything from scratch
14:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> Definitely not status website
14:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> nor any servers crawler
14:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> status.tw has no player ingame stats cuz it based on masterserver
14:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> status.tw has no player ingame stats cuz it based on masterserver list
14:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> and its bad a bit
14:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> ðŸ™‚ That's right
14:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Savander> there is no much information about stats, not needed for server-list
15:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> waiting for 0.8's server-side stat-counting and update masterserver for monitoring players' stats
15:18 < ChillerDragon> what stats do you want to collect and why do you need econ for it @Savander also wb :)
15:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> I need some opinions on this one:
15:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1458
15:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> Do you think it would be okay to quantize the velocity with 0.01 accuracy? The client would show the correct path for projectiles in this case.
16:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> looking at the image, it doesn't seem like a big deal
16:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't understand why we can't increase the precision though
16:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah, it's in the protocol
16:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> Yeah. I think doing 0.01 quantization is easier than introducing compatibility code for increasing the precision
16:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah, definitely
16:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> so a server patch
16:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> And by using round instead of int cast we could even halve the error
17:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> vanilla econ/rcon logging is kinda broken, so parsing is possible to the point wuere people need to change the map.
17:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> where
18:53 < ChillerDragon> oof what map change issues did you encounter @jxsl13? I was asked to add some maps to my vanilla server
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I forgot how you parse your joining player stuff, but my issue was that on a map change a ton of people join in an order that is mostly based on ping, which cannot really be extracted from the logs.
22:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> The logging of vanilla teeworlds has at no point a consistent assiciation between nickname/ip/id, making it impossible to associate those correctly on a map change.
22:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> My previous approach was to have a joining player state machine that changes state then a new player is ready, then the next state where the player gets his nickname, etc. this gets broken when a ton of players join a the same time. all of them are in thebready state (10 messages with ip/id being in state ready), then they get a nickname(I think this is the part that seemingly does not exist anymore in vanilla, you might have a diff
22:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (discord crap. )@ChillerDragon
22:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> player ready ip/id -> next player in state "get nickname" is the previously ready player .... this works with one player joinijg at a time.
22:58 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 10 players ready ip/id -> 10 nicknames in arbitrary order, try associating ip/id with nick
