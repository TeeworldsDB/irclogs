00:04 < teetow> swedtopia is best topia
15:03 < Safa_[A_boy]> IMPORTANT: How is the maintainer of the TeeWorlds Transifex project? There is someone how needs to be kicked out of Arabic team! How can I get the Arabic team permissions?
15:04 < Safa_[A_boy]> Reason for kicking: Huge amount of typos and wrong translation!
15:05 < Safa_[A_boy]> BTW, What happend for the plural? :(
15:05 <@minus> heinrich5991 admins that
15:13  * Safa_[A_boy] about 10 strings needs to be plural...
15:19  * Safa_[A_boy] restarted the laptop
15:21  * Safa_[A_boy] there is something wrong, A tiny mouse appears in the game
15:21 < Safa_[A_boy]> curser*
15:36 < Safa_[A_boy]> The game is flashing! Why?
15:38 < Safa_[A_boy]> What is the meaning of  """   "%s %d/%d", Localize("Match")   """
15:45 < Safa_[A_boy]> I understood it know :D
16:10 < fisted> Safa_[A_boy]: are you sure they need to be plural in all places they appear?
16:10 < fisted> stuff like that is a common problem and the main reason why i18n largely sucks
16:11 < Safa_[A_boy]> I didn't understand "in all places they appear" well...
16:12 < fisted> let me try an example
16:12 < fisted> take for instance the word "Red" (as it appears in "Red team", and in just "Red" when referring to a team color)
16:13  * Safa_[A_boy] is this plural?
16:13 < fisted> in german, you'd need two translations for this word, actually, because "Red Team" is "Rotes Team", while just "Red" is "Rot"
16:13 < fisted> no that has nothing to do with plural
16:13 < fisted> but it is the same underlying problem
16:13 < Safa_[A_boy]> Well, It's done like that in 0.7 as I see...
16:14 < fisted> alright.  doesn't matter, though, because i'm only trying to explain a specific family of translation issues
16:15 < fisted> in your case, you should consider all places where the word you're changing appears
16:15 < fisted> for each place, see if it makes sense to be plural
16:15 < fisted> brb
16:43 < fisted> back
16:51  * Safa_[A_boy] trying to find a solution for plural
17:09 < Safa_[A_boy]> I have an idea, but I can't implement it because I'm not a C++ developer
17:11  * Safa_[A_boy] will make a paste for not flooding the channel
17:25 < Safa_[A_boy]> http://pastebin.com/aMwPgyWB :)
17:26 < Safa_[A_boy]> Is such thing possible?
17:26 <@minus> i guess gettext has plural support
18:04 < Safa_[A_boy]> minus: IT HAS PLURAL SUPPORT
18:04 < Safa_[A_boy]> I said that many times
18:47 <@matricks> localization... it's just a can of never ending worms
18:47 <@minus> matricks: maybe they like fishing
18:48 <@matricks> too much bait, too little pond
18:48 <@minus> true
18:48  * minus has all his things in english
18:48 <@minus> works fine
18:50 <@minus> matricks: you missed birdie?
18:50 <@matricks> didn't go
18:50 <@minus> well obviously
18:51 <@minus> hard to go there when in austria
18:51 <@matricks> I was in sweden at home
18:51 <@minus> wasn't it last weekend?
18:51 <@matricks> no
19:25 < heinrich5991> Safa_[A_boy]: the game currently doesn't work for arabic, right?
19:27  * Safa_[A_boy] is watching a football match
19:27 < Safa_[A_boy]> heinrich5991: Not exactly
19:41 < BeaR_> heinrich5991: You are still working on the unicode support? Did some quick test with pango, works pretty fine (:
19:45 < heinrich5991> BeaR_: mh. for some reason in the past I didn't really like pango
19:46 < heinrich5991> maybe it was platform problems or so
19:46 < heinrich5991> or that it's too big or something
19:46 < heinrich5991> don't remember
19:46 < BeaR_> yeah it's pretty big and fontconfig is also annoying /:
19:47 < heinrich5991> aside from that it looked really good
19:47 < heinrich5991> but the problem is that we need to provide downloads at teeworlds.com, and the larger the game is the less likely ppl are to download it I guess
20:21 < heinrich5991> meh
20:21 < heinrich5991> 30s lag on the interface
20:23 <@minus> speaking of downloads. i should move the download server and cancel the service
20:50  * Safa_[A_boy] : |
