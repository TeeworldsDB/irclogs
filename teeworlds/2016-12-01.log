08:53 <@minus> no time, no tickets
10:13 < EastByte> heinrich5991: I'm not sure
11:01 <@minus> but tickets are already sold out, can you still get in?
11:03 < EastByte> well, I did some angel work in the previous kongress but looks like I didn't get a voucher
11:03 < EastByte> but I have a few friends there, so wouldn't be impossible to get in I guess
11:04 < EastByte> strange, I didn't find it that crowded last time, why did they limit the sales on this way
13:45 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: last year it was sold out
15:08  * koomi is coming
15:09 <+koomi> if you had asked in time I could have given you vouchers :-P
15:11 < EastByte> well, I guess I can skip c3 once
15:11 <@heinrich5991> koomi: I'll ask you next year :)
15:22 <+koomi> sure, assuming they keep a similar scheme
