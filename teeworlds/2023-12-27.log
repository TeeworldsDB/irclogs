14:20 < bridge> <blade67> Note to self: Printing entire buffers in Godot is not a good idea. Crashes the editor every time
14:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Xd
15:03 < bridge> <blade67> I can't seem to read the name of layers
15:17 < bridge> <blade67> Interestingly enough I get the correct amount of characters but the encoding doesn't seem to be ascii...
15:19 < bridge> <robyt3> Layer names are not C strings. See `I32String` in the documentation.
15:21 < bridge> <blade67> OH
15:22 < bridge> <blade67> That makes sense-ish
15:23 < bridge> <blade67> Now to figure out how to convert that in Godot
16:16 < bridge> <blade67> A i32String seems to only hold 8 characters, but I could save a name of 9 characters in the game, and it still loads with it as well. What's going on here?
16:30 < bridge> <blade67> Note that I can't seem to read that last character from my map file
17:05 < bridge> <robyt3> One unit of `I32String` is a 32 bit int, 4 bytes. The layer name consists of 3 `I32String` according to the documentation so the string is at most 12 bytes long (of which the last one is probably the zero terminator)
17:10 < seabass> ChillerDragon: helloooo 
17:10 < seabass> Just wanted to let you know that your CTF5 server is having some lag issues right now (60ms extra ping or so)
17:19 < bridge> <blade67> Oh, it's 3x4bytes! That makes sense, although not specified in the docs
17:20 < bridge> <blade67> Actually, no, it does make sense
17:20 < bridge> <blade67> Silly me
18:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Oh no ill have a look later
18:16 < bridge> <chillerdragon> (<@572881769641279488_seabass>)
22:03 < seabass> ChillerDragon, good to hear that; thanks :)
