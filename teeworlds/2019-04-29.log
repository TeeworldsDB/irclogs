22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how does tha command autocompletion work? Is it possible to send commands from a server mod to vanilla client? Like rcon commands
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
22:44 <@Dune> not afaik?
22:44 <@heinrich5991> are we talking rcon or chat?
22:46 <@Dune> I think this is about chat
22:47 <@Dune> the chat commands set the layouts for more (like the rcon stuff) but nothing like that is implemented (yet)
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> chat
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> do we have a issue for it?
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sounds like a nice feature to me
22:50 <@Dune> nope, we don't have an issue for it
22:50 <@Dune> so if you have some idea that wouldn't be too heavy to implement write it :)
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i will create an issue and u haxx0rs can deal with it :p
22:51 <@Dune> well, the main issue is the design part, from my understanding it shouldn't be too heavy if vanilla teeworlds doesn't benefit from it anyhow
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm idk couldnt it be sovled similar to the remote console?
22:53 <@Dune> yeah but what chat commands would you want exactly, how do you select them etc
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wdym? Just let the server sent what it wants and let the client autocomplete them? Exactly like remote console does it.
23:02 <@Dune> currently, commands are translated into (basically) f1 console commands
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah i see
23:03 <@Dune> and it's not even that simple, the /friend thing does something smarter according to the name
23:03 <@Dune> so unless the server sends remote code to execute (lol) you cannot reproduce the behavior of the currently implemented commands by sending them from the server
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea these command should be transalte into normal chat messages and the server can do with them what he wants. I would not do any fancyer
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and then the server does something with the chat message if it wants. Like all chat commands work in 0.6
23:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> probably the chat commands from the server should be marked optically
23:05 <@Dune> that's a design idea, yeah. should write that down
23:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh thought thats kinda obvious xd
23:06 <@Dune> it's not (and it has downsides to do it like that, it's a bit dirty to send it via chat) etc
23:06 <@Dune> there are probably alternatives to that too
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes its dirty via chat and it worked fine for years
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> doing something nicer only for mod support isnt vanilla style i guess
23:07 <@Dune> yeah because mods don't really have a standard for smooth UX/UI
23:07 <@Dune> teeworlds is different
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im not agianst it. But idk who would go through the effort for nothing.
23:07 <@Dune> teeworlds did stuff just for the mod support, but usually it has to be something that's not too big and burdensome to support
23:08 <@Dune> (this only binds me, I'm not in charge of that decision :P)
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is it even possible to turn the vanilla commands of?
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> imo they are annoying coming from 0.6 and expecting only server commands doing everything in console or via binds
23:10 <@Dune> you can't use binds to mute a player
23:10 <@Dune> it's faster to do it that way than to escape -> browse the menus and click it
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> didnt mute a player in the last 3 yrs lol
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i like talking to people ðŸ˜ƒ
23:13 <@Dune> lots of spam in large servers, maybe it's different on moderated race servers
23:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no its worse
23:13 <@Dune> then maybe you have a high tolerance to bullshit :)
23:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yep
23:13 <@Dune> I think the "show social" button is there for a reason
23:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> "be unsocial"*
23:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ya well lez see if the 0.6 community even moves to 0.7 at some pomnit -.-
