05:15 < tsamt> hi
13:43 < jxsl13> BotoX :O?
15:39 < Sadale> Interesting. It seems that my ctf server got some constant players.
15:39 < Sadale> not sure why. It's located in Asia and has high ping :S
15:39 < heinrich5991> I hope it's a serious server with a exlamation mark and lots of spaces in the front of the server name :)
15:40 < Sadale> lol it isn't
15:40 < Sadale> BTW, I hate the "!     " servers
15:41 < Sadale> It's a 24/7 server, tho :p
15:56 < allu2> Sadale: I hate them too, yet run 3 of them :P Still hoping client would default to player count sorting instead of name
15:56 < Sadale> allu2, I hate you now :P
15:57 < allu2> This way players who want to play with others could just join any server and have that server rise in priority
15:57  * allu2 proud hoster of ChickenServer 2, 4, and 5
15:57  * Sadale is the hoster of HK servers :3
15:58 < Sadale> They're named "HK <whatever> Server"
15:58 < allu2> But honestly I don't like the ! space spam's ether
15:59 < allu2> Would be so much better to have them sorted by the amount of players on the server, since I think the rules of masterserver phorbit faking playing players
16:00 <@minus> send a PR
16:00 < guenstig_werben> is some dev here who have enough free time to help me/other making a mod?
16:00 < Sadale> allu2, why do you do that if you hate it? :P
16:00 < Sadale> guenstig_werben, probably no. Maybe you can wait for other dev. But to be honest, it's unlikely to happen.
16:01 < guenstig_werben> ok
16:01 < Sadale> alright. bedtime \o/
16:01 < heinrich5991> not over here
16:01 < heinrich5991> where are you from?
16:03 < Sadale> China.
16:03 < Sadale> alright. good night :3
16:08 < rand> allu2: hey, do you plan to push TeeBot2 again on github repo ? :3
16:18 < dhkmt> could anyone help me with compiling teeworlds using g++? it has problems with "closest_point_on_line" and tells me that clamp is not declared in this scope but later in math.h...
16:19 < guenstig_werben> ?
16:19 < guenstig_werben> not using bam?
16:19 < dhkmt> ofc using bam
16:19 < dhkmt> but bam is configured to use g++
16:20 < dhkmt> its the following function: http://puu.sh/k1TLS/e079d4ec57.png
16:21 < heinrich5991> dhkmt: can you post the exact error message, please?
16:21 < heinrich5991> (the first one, if there are multiple)
16:21 < dhkmt> sure
16:21 < dhkmt> i'll put it on pastebini
16:22 < dhkmt> http://pastebin.com/rLYmtr5i
16:24 < heinrich5991> dhkmt: you shold be able to fix that by adding a '#include "math.h"' in src/base/vmath.h
16:24 < dhkmt> clear
16:24 < dhkmt> oops
16:24 < dhkmt> ok
16:25 < dhkmt> it already is
16:25 < heinrich5991> only with <>, not with ""
16:25 < heinrich5991> you need both
16:25 < dhkmt> oh, okay
16:25 < dhkmt> could you explain me why?
16:25 < heinrich5991> (<math.h> is from the standard library and "math.h" is from the current directory)
16:25 < dhkmt> ah
16:26 < dhkmt> works fine, thank you
16:38 < guenstig_werben> got a problem
16:39 < guenstig_werben> I'm trying to compile warcraft sources (with bam files from ddnet, crazy dev don't add them)
16:39 < guenstig_werben> I'm running into following problem
16:39 < guenstig_werben> src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp:19:19: fatal error: conio.h: No such file or directory
16:39 < guenstig_werben> compilation terminated.
16:39 < guenstig_werben> bam: 'objs/game/server/gamecontext.o' error 256
16:39 < guenstig_werben> bam: error: a build step failed
16:39 < heinrich5991> guenstig_werben: it's probably only for windows
16:40 < guenstig_werben> conio.h is a Windows file
16:40 < guenstig_werben> I know
16:40 < heinrich5991> conio.h is a header file specific to windows
16:40 < guenstig_werben> but how can I do that in Linux?
16:40 < heinrich5991> 1) compile it on windows, run it in wine
16:40 < guenstig_werben> I mean it's platform independent.... teeworlds
16:41 < heinrich5991> or 2) check where function from conio.h are used (most likely `getch()`) and replace them with equivalents
16:41 < heinrich5991> the mod might not be platform-independant
16:42 < guenstig_werben> OK.... damit
16:44 < LittleWhite> could use ncurses to have similar function, I think
16:50 < allu2> rand: I think I'll do some work on TeeBot soon, perhaps then
16:50 < rand> come plugins are missing :/
16:50 < rand> *som
16:50 < rand> *some
17:03 < allu2> from repo?
17:03 < allu2> Some aren't included on purpose though
17:04 < rand> plugin_loader wants to load missing plugins
17:04 < allu2> :P Should be easy to fix
17:05 < rand> ofc
17:05 < allu2> But yeah I'll rework some stuff today hopefully fixing that problem as well
17:05 < rand> but im sad fresh teebot can't run without fix this ^^
17:05 < rand> :D
20:45 < allu2> Any info on when could we expect 0.6.4 binaries?
20:46 < heinrich5991> when Oy announces that the translations are done, I guess
20:47 < heinrich5991> why do you ask? :)
20:52 < allu2> Partly paranoid of the spoofing vulnerability, partly wondering if I should try make the "sort by players on default" and hope to get it into 0.6.4 (since afaik 0.7 might take another 3-4 months to pop up)
20:53 < Henningstone> sorry, if you think 0.7 will come in 3 months you are completely beyond good and evil :/
20:54 < allu2> I got the image its estimated to be on this side of the year
20:54 < Henningstone> and not everything of the spoofing problem is fixed in 0.6.4, though
20:54 < heinrich5991> allu2: the best thing to do would probably be to open an issue on github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
20:54 < heinrich5991> if you don't have a github account, I could do it for oyu
20:55 < Henningstone> he has
20:55 < allu2> I do, I'm just pondering if the change can be so hard I couldn't make up patch for it myself before making it
20:55 < allu2> (Since I've basicly never touched the TW source itself :S
20:56 < heinrich5991> allu2: have you programmed before? if so, you could definitely try
20:57 < Henningstone> java and python I guess, allu2? ;)
20:57 < allu2> I have, just wondering where the default sorting is decided, quick look made me think to try changing stuff in https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/serverbrowser.h
20:58 < allu2> Henningstone: Indeed, I know C and C++ but never really done anything big on them
20:58 < heinrich5991> allu2: if you want to cheat (:P) I can tell you where the default sort order is defined
20:58 < allu2> Since I started with Java/Python C and C++ feel bit clumsy to me :P
20:59 < Henningstone> It should be in menus_browser.h if I am right?
20:59 < heinrich5991> it might be there, but it isn't in this case
20:59 < heinrich5991> note that the sorted column persists between restarts :)
20:59 < Henningstone> never used them ^^
21:00 <@minus> allu2: making a patch for default sorting order?
21:00 < allu2> Was planning to
21:00 < heinrich5991> (i.e. it's saved in the config, so you can find the defaults in https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/shared/config_variables.h )
21:00 <@minus> +1
21:00 < allu2> But I kinda feel everyone of you could do it in fraction of the time I would :D
21:00 <@minus> would merge
21:00 <@minus> though it's not my place to merge that
21:00 < Henningstone> Oh if it is a config var it is so easy :D
21:01 < Henningstone> just change one number, done.
21:01 < heinrich5991> (yea, but you need to place a magic value there, not so nice)
21:01 < heinrich5991> i.e. 4 if I'm not mistaken
21:01 <@minus> it's okay
21:02 <@minus> br_sort 4; br_sort_order 1
21:03 < Henningstone> ah then just try to adjust the value in f1 and see what happens :)
21:03 < allu2> Just when I managed to figure its 4 I look here you guys talking of it :D
21:03 < heinrich5991> yea, sort_order 1 is kinda important :)
21:04 < allu2> Btw why br_sort and those wont show up in autocomplete on F1?
21:04 < allu2> They work when you type them but it doesn't suggest them
21:05 < allu2> Or actually it does at some point.. but br_s doesn't suggest "br_sort br_sort_order" instead it shows nothing to me
21:05 < allu2> while br_ shows also br_sort and br_sort_order
21:06 < Henningstone> invalid, it instantly displays them to me
21:06 < allu2> Eh ok, so now it works again :S
21:06 < rand> xD
21:06 < allu2> Seems like it somehow scrolled to the right
21:07 < allu2> Ah, so if you br_ tab to the end, then remove and type br_s you see nothing
21:07 < Henningstone> yeah there is a bug if you scroll to the right and then the list is shortened down, you are at the right anyway (doesn't scroll back)
21:08 < Henningstone> should fix that ^^
21:10 < Henningstone> just press tab and it scrolls back to the left :/
21:11 < rand> there are other magic values in config_variables
21:11 < rand> one more…
21:15 < heinrich5991> rand: which one? :)
21:16 < Henningstone> Since I'm not a wizard, I don't like magic values... but wait... maybe I am a wizard... Look that: 10^15==5, 10>>1==5, ~10==5
21:17 < rand> hm, ec_output_level, some sv variables
21:17 < rand> (ok it's a bit bad faith)
21:19 < heinrich5991> ~10 == -11 I think
21:19 < rand> not to add magic value, we can swap SORT_NAME and SORT_NUMPLAYERS in engine/serverbrowser.h :3
21:20 < rand> --->[]
21:22 <@minus>  heinrich5991: not -9?
21:23 < heinrich5991> thought so too, but luckily I decided to enter it into python before posting :D
21:25 <@minus> oh, brain derp, i was thinking of 0 as the highest negative number
21:27 < Henningstone> hm then I actually thought wrong... It is -11 indeed. I thought ~1010==0101?
21:28 < allu2> rand: I was originally thinking something like moving the = 0 from SORT_NAME to SORT_NUMPLAYERS but I honestly have no idea how those are used or if it would make any difference :P (noob when it comes to TW source)
21:28 < Henningstone> wait, the negative interpretation of this would be... 1011 so -11
21:29 < heinrich5991> Henningstone: you're not counting the leading zeros
21:29 < heinrich5991> 10 is 0b000...01010
21:29 < heinrich5991> -11 is 0b11...10101
21:29 < heinrich5991> *0b111
21:31 < rand> allu2: from what i see, it's use smartly
21:33 < Henningstone> heinrich5991: oups I've cut them of, but if you take the 2nd comlement you have 10101..01011 == -11 ^^ binary has so much lol...
21:34 < rand> allu2: there is no for loop on this enum
22:00 < allu2> So is it alright if I just make pull request with the changes to the config_variables on the 0.6 branch? I did test that the values sorted servers by player count in most players first order by default
22:01 < Fels> oink
22:01 < Henningstone> allu2: that is the sense of pr's. if it is not ok, you'll be told :)
22:01 < Henningstone> wau
22:01 < allu2> :P
22:04 < allu2> Oh my, feeling nervous :P But sended the second PR in my life :P
22:05 < Henningstone> congraz ;)
22:06 < allu2> Would be great to get that change on as soon as possible, the "! (spaces)" competition for catching players is unbearable :P
22:07 < Henningstone> Yeah especially nowadays when the new steamplayers just enter the topmost servers and do not care about anything else
22:07 < Henningstone> btw what's up with steam? didn't look at it for a week :3
22:08 < Henningstone> ah, last 24 hours, a new peak of... wow... 883!!! was reached!!
22:09 < allu2> Nice :)
22:10 < allu2> Am I right in that by default you can't set server to say its arbitary gamemode(besides simply MOD)?
22:11 < Henningstone> it is hardcoded
22:11 < Henningstone> change it in the source
22:11 < Henningstone> but hey, heinrich5991 as you expected, the total number of players didn't rise... surprisingly or not; most longtime players may have switched to steam :/
22:12 < allu2> Hum thats inconvinient, I could've used such feature a lot
22:12 < Savander> 2000 playesr
22:12 < Savander> it's 2x more than before
22:12 < Savander> ;D
22:12 < Henningstone> rly? didn't see that number ever
22:12 < Henningstone> maybe I am looking at it the wrong time :(
22:13 < Henningstone> allu2: that is not inconvenient. a feature to change it if you are NOT a modder 'd be completely shit.
22:13 < allu2> Why I need it :P
22:13 < Henningstone> because every kiddy can than change the gamemode to something he want and nobody knows what he is actually running
22:14 < allu2> I could basicly do this https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11515 with a TeeBot plugin and thus wouldn't need to mod the server at all, but then I'd also have to go edit the server sources and compile to have appropriate mod name
22:15 < allu2> Ofcourse I have the option to write the plugin and run it as normal CTF (since server isn't modified at all :P )
22:15 < allu2> But I feel I'm kinda on the gray area as it is with TeeBot :P
22:16 < Henningstone> hm. didn't thought about. but vanilla tw doesn't care about mods, that should be the reason.
22:17 < allu2> but it already has the "MOD" gamemode :/ but its not really descriptive
22:17 < Henningstone> thats only a template for modders ^^
22:17 < allu2> I think you are forced to use it with tunings
22:18 < allu2> Could be wrong though
22:18 < Henningstone> you are right. it is forbidden to change ANYTHING in the game mechanics of vanilla (that includes tuning) so change to MOD->allowed.
22:19 < Henningstone> but never saw a server with "MOD" gamemode ;)
22:19 < allu2> But wouldn't it be all the same to allow use of "any X letters excluding DM, TDM, CTF"
22:19 < Savander> haha
22:19 < Savander> MOD isn't commented in source?
22:19 < Henningstone> no ofc not xD
22:20 < Henningstone> tuning would be completely useless than
22:20 < Henningstone> and if you change the server code so that it allowes tuning on vanilla, you'll get a masterserver ban.
22:21 < rand> oh, the masterserver can detect this ? 
22:21 < rand> or it's up to masterservers mainteners ?
22:21 < allu2> I'd imagine it to be manual
22:22 < Henningstone> would be awesome but I'm not sure if it really works. but people can detect it aswell and report it
22:22 < Henningstone> referre to this: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=3101
22:24 < Savander> Henningstone,  which tunning?
22:24 < Savander> i thought, mod.cpp is just template
22:24 < allu2> Savander: for exmaple setting gravity to 0.1
22:24 < Henningstone> Savander: in rcon => tune .. ..
22:24 < rand> it may be possible to code a fake client to check vanilla servers
22:24 < Savander> Henningstone,  mod doens't have anything to tunes
22:24 < Savander> "mod" gametype ofc
22:24 < Henningstone> wait i am confused. xD
22:25 < allu2> "Even if a modified server does not affect the vanilla gameplay, it must not run as CTF, DM or TDM." Which makes me bit afraid to do the opposite of having Vanilla server with non vanilla enforce gamestyle by TeeBot, thus for them I'd like possibility to have custom gamemode name (MOD being rather undescriptive)
22:26 < Savander> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/gamemodes/mod.cpp
22:26 < Savander> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/gamemodes/mod.h
22:26 < Savander> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L1376-L1377
22:26 < Savander> ;)
22:26 < Savander> template for you'r own mod
22:26 < rand> what are lms and sur btw ?
22:26 < Savander> new mods
22:27 < Savander> sur, if i remmber
22:27 < Savander> you have one life
22:27 < Henningstone> jaisgutaba: is tuning really done in the mod itself?
22:27 < Savander> it's dm
22:27 < Savander> ah not, LSM 
22:27 < Savander> Last Man Standing
22:27 < Savander> LMS*
22:27 < Henningstone> ^^
22:27 < Savander> Deathmatch without respaws
22:27 < rand> ok
22:27 < Savander> Sur, don't remmber
22:27 < Savander> but i know, in sur and LMS you have new graphics
22:27 < Savander> ;p
22:28 < rand> :D
22:29 < Henningstone> Savander: tuning is not defined in mod.cpp/ctf.cpp whatever.cpp
22:29 < Henningstone> try run a server with gametype "mod" and use "tune gravity 0".
22:29 < Henningstone> workz.
22:29 < Savander> in python
22:30 < Savander> i know
22:30 < Savander> ^^>
22:30 < Savander> i mean, it's a generated class
22:30 < Savander> with tunings
22:30 < Savander> am i wrong?
22:30 < rand> sur looks like lsm for tdm
22:31 < Savander> Team LMS
22:31 < Savander> ;D
22:31 < Savander> that's cool :D
22:31 < Savander> i played teeworlds with slopes
22:31 < rand> looks like survival ctf x)
22:31 < Savander> and Obst did a map for it
22:31 < Savander> realllyy good ctf map
22:31 < Henningstone> er, back to your question allu2, if you use TeeBot to modify the gameplay of a vanilla gametype'd server, you'll likely get a masterban too.
22:32 < Savander> Henningstone,  really? rules was changed?
22:32 < Savander> when?
22:32 < rand> Henningstone: that's why he asked about the MOD
22:32 < allu2> Yeah thats what I was thinking, so far TeeBot just adds some stats and broadcasts, which aren't affecting gameplay, but it could be made easily to for example move players who die to spectators while reducing amount of players allowed to play
22:33 < Savander> im just curious. As i remember, it was only when you modified standard gametype without changing mod name.
22:33 < rand> Savander: hm, indeed, the rules hasnt changed yet
22:33 < allu2> Thus creating survival kind of gameplay
22:33 < rand> but it's possible to change the gameplay thanks to econ bot
22:33 < Savander> econ is via telnet?
22:34 < allu2> Yeap
22:34 < Henningstone> hmmmmmm I am now reaaaallly not sure. but joining a modified vanilla doesn't work clientside and so I think you will be banned???
22:34 < Savander> I have never used :/
22:34 < Henningstone> since you are not "abusing" the rcon/econ. that is no problem!
22:34 < Savander> btw. Python allows you to use telnet?
22:34 < allu2> Yeap
22:35 < allu2> telnetlib
22:35 < Henningstone> but changing the server itself
22:35 < Henningstone> is a problem
22:35 < allu2> But as I said, I can edit gameplay mechanics by swift execution of rcon commands :P
22:35 < allu2> Without modifying server at all
22:35 < Henningstone> yeah of cause
22:35 < Savander> look, meskalin did a bot with quizes
22:35 < Henningstone> no problem at all
22:35 < Henningstone> I fancy that ^^
22:36 < Henningstone> but it is only client chat so no problem
22:36 < Savander> rcon isn't too
22:36 < Savander> it's just client
22:36 < Savander> So, for me it's legal
22:36 < Savander> you didn't change server code, k
22:37 < Savander> all is good
22:37 < Henningstone> ok conclude: if nothing at the server DIRECTLY is changed: LEGAL! if so, ILLEGAL
22:37 < Henningstone> ** if not
22:37 < Savander> it works like that, now
22:37 < Savander> ;P
22:37 < rand> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11433
22:38 < rand> What is a “pure” server ?
22:38 < Henningstone> oh dear, I'm really not up to date :(
22:38 < Savander> For me, without any changes in server code
22:38 < Henningstone> exactly this
22:39 < Savander> it's not possible to check, if client-bots are yours or not :D
22:39 < Henningstone> no it is not since they could be also a player :/
22:39 < Savander> exactly.
22:39 < rand> hm, econ is used with localhost
22:40 < Savander> you can bind adress
22:40 < Savander> if i remember?
22:40 < rand> ofc
22:40 < Henningstone> yes
22:40 < Henningstone> but it is dangerous :/
22:40 < Henningstone> there is some awesome stuff you can do ;D
22:40 < rand> but who will give open access to its server through econ ? ^^
22:40 < Savander> i have never used it
22:40 < Savander> nobody i guess
22:40 < Savander> or....
22:40 < Savander> if you have servers everywhere
22:41 < Savander> and want to do something from one server
22:41 < Savander> xd
22:41 < rand> its like rcon without graphics
22:41 < Savander> btw. Chat messages are there?
22:41 < Henningstone> rand: it is not that difficult to get the econ pw ;) uses spoofing... so it should be fixed anyway soon
22:42 < Henningstone> with some other shit it works too, but never tried it.
22:42 < rand> everything with econ_level_output 2
22:42 < Savander> really?
22:42 < Savander> i need to test it
22:42 < Savander> ;d
22:42 < rand> pickup, flag_grab
22:42 < Savander> first, enable telnet on my windows
22:42 < rand> kill
22:43 < rand> basically, when the server use Console->PrintLn() (or smth closed), if econ is enable, the message is sent
22:43 < rand> according to loglvl
22:44 < Savander> chat messages which level has?
22:45 < rand> hm, 0 or 1 I guess
22:47 < rand> 1
22:48 < Savander> thanks
22:48 < Savander> i'll check
22:48 < Savander> ;)
22:48 < rand> default level iirc
22:52 < Savander> level: 1
22:52 < Savander> for  chat messages
22:52 < Savander> it shows info about player too
22:52 < Savander> but without kill messages
22:52 < Savander> and pickups
22:53 < Savander> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=87076#p87076
22:54 < Savander> btw, another question.
22:54 < Savander> Just im curious
22:54 < Savander> php can use telnet?
22:54 < rand> idk
22:55 < Savander> like external console on website
22:55 < Savander> :PPP
22:55 < rand> er, it may be possible
22:55 < rand> telnet is plaintext
22:55 < allu2> Well our clan actually has remote control panel with real time chat from most(if not all) chicken milk servers
22:56 < Savander> ohm
22:56  * rand didn't know
22:56 < Savander> Im not really experienced in programing
22:56 < Savander> stupid questions
22:56 < rand> is that recent ? 
22:56 < allu2> rand: kinda management stuff, since it also includes global ban system
22:56 < allu2> I think its been a while for roosters, lucky made it afaik
22:57 < rand> ok
22:59 < allu2> I'm still bit unsure how I should go about with the plugin system
22:59 < Henningstone> use it and nvm.
22:59 < rand> i added econ on my bots too btw, i wanted to managed them with a TeeBot plugin 
23:00 < rand> but it didnt behave well
23:00 < allu2> I'm thinking I could make some "default_Plugins, additional_Plugins" files based thing
23:00 < allu2> So we keep default ones in default, those which will be published in github, and add manually the additional plugins we got per server
23:01 < rand> you can make something like supybot plugins
23:01 < allu2> This way it would be easy to make TeeBot work out of box in github
23:01 < rand> one folder per plugins
23:02 < allu2> Yeah we already have the one folder, but I'm bit unsure how to automate adding of all plugins in that folder :P
23:02 < allu2> (And make it look nice and pretty)
23:02 < allu2> Ofcourse I could go with some monstrous eval thingy
23:02 < rand> you can os.lsdir
23:03 < rand> wait
23:03 < rand> i made sth like that with an irc bot : http://git.died.re/botirc/tree/base.py#n61
23:05 < allu2> (Funny facts, TeeBot1.0 was originally made from my old irc bot )
23:05 < rand> :)
23:05 < allu2> telnetlib is nice when handling with irc as well :P
23:06 < Henningstone> allu2 the problem is, if some players see for example the killing spree messages and report that, your server might be anyway banned because nobody can now that it is just your TeeBot, that might suck.
23:07 < allu2> Henningstone: You mean like https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11235
23:07 < Henningstone> yes exactly :/
23:08 < allu2> But as it says, in MOTD it says TeeBot runs there with link to github
23:08 < allu2> and especially saying its making the killing spree messages
23:09 < Henningstone> the ks-msgs was just an example. take every type of plugin written by anybody. and "anybody" didn't make a note in his private server
23:09 < Henningstone> and he gets reproted.... doesn't realize...... banned.... VERY MAD
23:10 < allu2> But then again, I think its the server hosters responsibility to be brief about anything like TeeBot
23:11 < Henningstone> ok let's say it's his fault. xD
23:11 < allu2> Yeap :D
23:14 < rand> agreed
23:14 < rand> and that's player fault not to read motd
23:16 < Henningstone> +1 both
23:43 < allu2> Ugh every time I try develop something on Windows i get reminded I hate it so much :/
23:44 < Henningstone> xD that is the case every time I start it !! xD
23:44 < allu2> "ConnectionAbortedError: [WinError 10053] An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine"
23:44 < allu2> Cause trying to connect localhost is so darn hard :/
23:46 < rand> xD
23:54 < allu2> Windows is giving me canser with default programs :/ I mean seriously what is this shit? http://puu.sh/k2lKt/dad4fcf333.png --> http://puu.sh/k2lLu/777eff3487.png --> http://puu.sh/k2lM9/bb5666ccf0.png --> http://puu.sh/k2lMA/73ad5e9a76.png
23:54 < allu2> How the hell do I get this to run it with Python3 I select especially
23:54 < allu2> Since doing so makes it magically run python2 from another drive :/
23:55 < Henningstone> OH DEAR!! IS THIS WIN10????
23:55 < allu2> Nope 8.1 :P
23:55 < Henningstone> oh looks the same.
23:55 < Henningstone> win10 would be a big mistake ! 
23:55 <@minus> i've said it before and i'll say it again: install linux
23:55 < Henningstone> i have <3
23:56 < allu2> I have it, but rebooting for something that should be trivial to do is annoying
23:56 < Henningstone> on windows nothing is trivial what is not made by microsuck
23:56 < allu2> I mean its so annoying cause this is supposed to do what I expect right? but doesn't do it :/
23:59 <@minus> man, i've been using arch linux for 3 years already, i'm getting old
