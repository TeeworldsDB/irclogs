16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> when writing a whisper message autocompletion for names cannot be used :/ and even worse it just sends the message to another target thats a trap
16:54 < Dune> turns out writing shells is not that easy :P
17:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ?
17:18 < Dune> lots of corner cases to handle

17:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> last post contains spam in their signature, so basically a spambot that tries to bypass the system ðŸ˜„
17:26 < Dune> very common, please just repotr
18:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> How can i write a guide in the teeworlds forum?
18:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> It says i don't have permissions
18:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I want to do a guide to host your own lan-gctf-server for the mapper tournament
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Create it somewhere else, only approved (by mods) and useful tw tutorials are moved there
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> if u meant the Tutorials section
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes i do
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> where is a good place for it?
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Discussions, Mods? i guess
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe discussion makes a bit sense
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> thank you

20:12 < Haretuerk> ok, hi Dune
20:12 < Haretuerk> good evening
20:15 < Dune> cheers Haretuerk 
20:15 < Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=123948
20:16 < Haretuerk> omg, you are so quick!
20:16 < Dune> I recommend CM quickfire keyboards ;-)
20:19 < Haretuerk> ok, step by step.... ./teeworlds starts but without graphics
20:19 < Dune> Oh, nice that is progress
20:19 < Haretuerk> no wait
20:20 < Haretuerk> it works flawless from menu...
20:20 < Haretuerk> from command line without graphics.
20:20 < Dune> (hmm, it looks like flatpak/flathub installs maps, but to a location that is not found when you just start ./teeworlds_srv from anywhere. I think we should tweak storage.cfg)
20:20 < Dune> > it works flawless from menu...
20:20 < Dune> the Teeworlds start menu?
20:21 < Haretuerk> from linux mint menu
20:21 < Haretuerk> thats ok
20:21 < Haretuerk> starting teeworlds vom CLI is not necessary for me
20:22 < Dune> Ah, but the one from linux mint menus is the one installed by flatpak maybe?
20:22 < Dune> It would be nice if you could paste what you get when running `./teeworlds`, from the CLI
20:22 < Haretuerk> starting teewolrds_srv from CLI as discribed in the forum (looking for the maps)
20:22 < Dune> yeah right
20:22 < Dune> but I'm talking about the original error
20:23 < Dune> unzipping teeworlds, then ./teeworlds
20:23 < Dune> that's supposed to be the easy way, and I have the same system as you do, so I'm surprised it doesn't work
20:23 < Haretuerk> its a huge log... wait pastebin
20:23 < Dune> yeay for pastebin
20:24 < Haretuerk> https://pastebin.com/9YS2tYR1
20:24 < Haretuerk> thats ./teeworlds from CLI
20:24 < Dune> huh
20:24 < Dune> do you not have a data folder?
20:25 < Dune> ls data && ./teeworlds
20:25 < Haretuerk> and i have a screenshot from no-graphics-teeworlds
20:25 < Dune> looks like windows 95 icons? :D
20:25 < Haretuerk> yes windows logo
20:25 < Dune> haha yeah
20:25 < Dune> that means it didn't find your data folder
20:25 < Haretuerk> no data folder in that directory
20:25 < Dune> did you move teeworlds.exe without its data folder nearby? that'd be the issue 
20:26 < Haretuerk> exe? i am an linux.... here: /var/lib/flatpak/app/com.teeworlds.Teeworlds/x86_64/stable/9c3c7a1f4ec22bf6c0c5601e180f4a2237262037e7fa79606c3c48fb11039fed/files/bin$
20:26 < Dune> oops, no .exe indeed :D
20:26 < Dune> right, but I'm not talking about flatpak now
20:26 < Dune> Can you
20:26 < Dune> 1. get linux x86_64 from https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=downloads
20:26 < Dune> 2. unzip it
20:26 < Dune> 3. ./teeworlds
20:27 < Dune> (or start it from the file explorer, should work too)
20:27 < Haretuerk> ok
20:29 < Haretuerk> ok, downloaded 7.4. now works fine... but why
20:30 < Dune> "works fine... but why" most frequently asked question on unix systems :D
20:30 < Haretuerk> you did not change that zip last days?
20:31 < Dune> no!
20:31 < Haretuerk> maybe i had some old 0.6.x or 0.7.3x? stuff installed
20:31 < Dune> well, they shouldn't break either
20:32 < Haretuerk> ok, and no I can start the server from that zip... works
20:33 < Dune> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
20:33 < Haretuerk> i kind of dont like that flatpak stuff
20:34 < Dune> it's just an alternative I proposed, you don't have to use it
20:34 < Dune> it should run just with flatpak run com.teeworlds.teeworlds, but it's not really built for running the server afaik
20:34 < Haretuerk> maybe distribute server seperately?
20:34 < Dune> you can also use Steam on linux
20:35 < Dune> yeah maybe
20:35 < Haretuerk> Dune, thank you so much for this support, maybe one day i can help the teeworlds comunity in another way
20:36 < Dune> np, that was easy
20:36 < Dune> you could draw your own skin :)
20:36 < Dune> actually we could use a short guide on that :p
20:36 < Dune> cc @Assa ;)
20:37 < Haretuerk> my english is to bad, i could do german stuff
20:38 < Dune> you could introduce more people to play Teeworlds at work
20:39 < Haretuerk> i do!!
20:39 < Dune> thereby decreasing your workplace productivity
20:39 < Haretuerk> there are ~10 kids here....
20:39 < Haretuerk> so we need our private server
20:39 < Dune> makes sense!
20:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yet another guide in bad english
20:39 < Haretuerk> noobs against online highskillers is annoying
20:39 < Dune> Check https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewforum.php?id=24 for mods
20:40 < Dune> yeah I get you Haretuerk
20:40 < Dune> it's possible to vote in servers to have max 4, 6, 8 players etc
20:40 < Dune> that could help
20:41 < Haretuerk> ok, see you then, have a nice evening
20:41 < Dune> see ya
22:13 < rand> I didn't know weak hook was that weak :o
