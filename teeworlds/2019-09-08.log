13:29 <@Dune> hey day
13:29 <@Dune> when you use joystick
13:29 <@Dune> does your mouse teleport like crazy?
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is there an easy way to prevent the execution of sv_map after the config has been loaded?
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> neither votes,not rcon execution
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and enforce change_map instead
16:31 < Oy> Dune: didn't that come up before https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2218 ? should that be fixed?
16:31 <@Dune> what came up before 2218?
16:31 <@Dune> ah, missing comma :p
16:32 <@Dune> I haven't really heard of what @fokkonaut mentions here
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ?
16:34 < Oy> the scoreboard increases the size when there are more players but doesn't get smaller when there are fewer players again
16:34 < Oy> someone mentioned that before, dunno where it was
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea
16:36 <@Dune> can't confirm but that should probably be fixed
16:36 < Oy> that circleci seems broken on ur pr
16:36 <@Dune> yeah, because of sdl
16:36 < Oy> nah
16:37 <@Dune> huh
16:37 <@Dune> ah, right, it just doesn't show anything :/
16:37 < Oy> some internal error
16:37 < Oy> pipe error
16:37 <@Dune> heinrich5991 might have a clue?
16:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oy, what about we let players decide in which order they want the scoreboard entries? (so you can move score back left again and flag to the right, for example)
16:37 <@Dune> gotta have a bit of courage with design decisions imo
16:37 < Oy> there was a discussion about that before
16:37 <@Dune> can't make everything customisable
16:38 < Oy> yeah can't make options for everything
16:39 <@Dune> you can always have custom clients for that too
16:40 <@Dune> I would argue that maybe those verbose debugs with velocity/player shots should be the job of custom server modifications, since they're to be used with a custom external tool anyway
16:41 <@Dune> if you want lots of stats for your server, just add debugs in your own server code
16:41 < Oy> but then you're not allowed to run pure servers
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> correct
16:41 <@Dune> oh, that's right
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> for real?
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> is that a modification already?
16:41 < Oy> yeah, no modifications allowed
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what
16:41 <@Dune> usually servers that show no different behavior are tolerated
16:41 <@Dune> you can't detect them anyway
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or use econ
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> like chiller
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> he has a vanilla server with stats in 0.6
16:42 < Oy> yeah you can run the script via econ, no problem there
16:42 < Oy> you don't change the server code
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Btw, Oy
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> How do I detect incoming packages
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> because i wanna debug the out of buffer thing
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> when many people have rainbow
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> wasn't that econ stuff considered different beaviour already ðŸ˜®
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and not allowed to be vanilla?
16:43 <@Dune> huh? econ is integrated in vanilla?
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I mean running some kinda script
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yes, Dune? :D
16:43 <@Dune> seems like travis ran fine
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> for like extra server messages?
16:43 < Oy> well, it that econ had been done for that purpose
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or something like tat
16:44 < Oy> so you don't have to touch the server code
16:44 <@Dune> I think appveyor will fail though
16:44 < Oy> failed because of that unused variable last time :)
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think I read something a few years ago saying that some announcement bot/script via econ on a vanilla server was not allowed. Weird. Don't host any vanilla servers, so I don't really care much about the consensus opinion there.
16:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but would be neat to know correctly
16:46 <@Dune> as far as joysticks are concerned, there are still a few issues (obviously)
16:46 <@Dune> the 1 joystick sensitivity seems too high for some controllers
16:46 <@Dune> no reason to *50 it
16:47 <@Dune> and the whole jitter tolerance thing is very confusing for end users
16:47 <@Dune> huh, maybe I should rename it to "dead zone", could be more intuitive
16:47 < Oy> yeah, true
16:49 <@Dune> I thought about generating a GUI of server sided commands, since we fetch descriptions for them from the server
16:49 <@Dune> Most people probably know how to deal with rcon though now
16:50 < Oy> now circleci failed
16:50 <@Dune> same error?
16:50 < Oy> the sdl thing
16:51 <@Dune> :|
16:51 <@Dune> I don't understand why
16:51 < Oy> what os is that?
16:51 <@Dune> I guess different SDL versions?
16:51 <@Dune> circleci? idk
16:51 <@Dune> I can't see the error you're talking about (anymore)
16:53 <@Dune> https://circleci.com/gh/teeworlds/teeworlds/1129
16:54 < Oy> oh, still have it open from when it happened
16:54 <@Dune> not sure what's going on with that
16:55 < Oy> src/engine/client/input.cpp:102:78: error: 'SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MAX' was not declared in this scope   return static_cast<float>(SDL_JoystickGetAxis(m_pJoystick, Axis)) / (float)(SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MAX+1);
16:55 < Oy> maybe older sdl version
16:55 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-libs/blob/4bf6dbc8c9f9b2fa89b2b5be1928f5e85bca01e6/sdl/include/SDL_joystick.h#L288-L289
16:56 <@Dune> input.cpp includes SDL.h, includes SDL_joystick.h
16:56 <@Dune> since you have the log with that error, can you check how circleci gets SDL? is it teeworlds-libs?
16:58 < Oy> Unpacking libsdl2-2.0-0:amd64 (2.0.5+dfsg1-2)
16:58 < Oy> seems old
16:59 <@Dune> yeah
16:59 <@Dune> we ship 2.0.8
17:00 < Oy> SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MAX came with 2.0.6
17:00 <@Dune> yeah, just checked
17:00 <@Dune> so either use #ifdef SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MAX or revert
17:00 < Oy> just add a define in input.cpp then
17:01 <@Dune> #ifndef SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MAX #define SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MAX 32768?
17:01 < Oy> yeah
17:01 <@Dune> or 32767 rather :)
17:01 < Oy> yeah :P
17:02 <@Dune> I wonder how almost every game detects good joystick sensitivity/tolerance parameters and the right axis #
17:02 < Oy> test hardware :D
17:02 <@Dune> ah :)
17:02 <@Dune> I used some messy virtual joysticks
17:03 < Oy> :D
17:04 <@Dune> now that I think of it, it might not be too hard to support joystick axis to do some bind action
17:05 <@Dune> it's not going to be easy to draw a GUI for that though lol
17:05 <@Dune> maybe we should only support joysticks to do +left/+right
17:05 <@Dune> at least GUI-wise
17:05 <@Dune> stranger builds can be done through the console
17:06 < Oy> stranger things?
17:06 <@Dune> binds*
17:07 < Oy> buttons should work already via the gui
17:08 < Oy> and the left/right in joystick menu
17:08 < Oy> should suffice
17:08 <@Dune> so in the menus, we jsut add two columns for +left and +right?
17:10 < Oy> think it's good how you did it in ur pr :)
17:10 <@Dune> I mean, it's still not good enough, right? only supports one axis
17:10 <@Dune> I mean, one stick
17:10 < Oy> ah
17:10 < Oy> hm
17:12 < Oy> but you have 6 axis there right now, probably 3 sticks then?
17:12 < Oy> don't have one to test
17:12 <@Dune> yeah it supports 3 sticks
17:12 <@Dune> but you can only control aim X/Y
17:12 <@Dune> not actions such as +left
17:12 < Oy> ah
17:13 < Oy> you can bind it to a joystick button, but no axis yeah
17:13 <@Dune> so in practice, you can only use one stick
17:13 < Oy> dunno how hard it'll be to make the axis bindable
17:14 <@Dune> would probably be very annoying to make it work with the UiDoKeyBinder
17:14 <@Dune> and you can't have the left/right dynamic
17:14 <@Dune> I mean, both sides of the axis have to be a different action
17:14 < Oy> yeah, different system, doesn't work like a button
17:15 <@Dune> yeah, need someone with an actual device to improve it :P
17:15 < Oy> yeah
17:17 < Oy> and keyboard+mouse will be superior anyway :)
17:17 <@Dune> now that's a politically charged statement :p
17:17 < Oy> :P
17:18 < Oy> you do a pr for the define thing? or shall i just add it?
17:19 <@Dune> oh, yeah just do it :)
17:19 < Oy> ok :)
17:30 <@Dune> circleci passed :)
17:31 <@Dune> heinrich5991, should I look for a different host for the IRC bot?
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @oy, when new release? xd
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> want the browser and the scoreboard fix and so on
19:11 <@Dune> you can have trunk clients built if we merge https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2194 :)
19:13 < Oy> new release would be cool, lots of fixes
19:13 < Oy> should do one soonish
19:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ^yes
19:39 <@Dune> I'd personally like a few more substantial features, we don't have so many new features
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm waiting for the mapeditor thingy
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that looks actually awesome
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> btw
