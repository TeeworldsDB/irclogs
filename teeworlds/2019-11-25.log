02:20 < redix> yes, race mod only supports one output for teleports. there is no use for randomness on maps where people care about milliseconds :D
02:24 < redix> since ddnet did not have any plans to move to 0.7, i did not really care about any compatibility. all physics stuff (teleports, speedups, stoppers, ...) is implemented in a predictable way
02:26 < redix> about the layer format: the old format way not really extendable... the layers were just defined by flags and multiple mods used the same flags for different/incompatible layer types
02:28 < redix> 0.7 race stores all tile indices in the game layer and for teleport numbers, speedup angle, ... it uses invisible tile layers with special names (#tele, #sp-angle, ...)
02:29 < redix> advantage of this: it's very easy to implement in the server since you don't need to modify to map loading code
02:31 < redix> and you can open and edit the maps with the standard client... however this is really not user friendly, but i never found time to implement proper editing functionality in the client
02:34 < redix> to be honest: from a technical view it would be better to have some proper way to extend the layers... just like the protocol extension
02:36 < redix> while ddnet and the race mod will probably never have compatible phsyics code, i'm open for a common layer format :D
09:30 < Learath2> redix: Exactly what I wanted to do, we could use uuids to extend layers. Not sure if our design goals would align though. I'm not sure I care about ddnet maps being editable in the vanilla editor at all. Even if made possible it'd be a pain
12:18 < redix> Using uuids sounds good. I don't really care about editing in the vanilla editor anymore. It's indeed a pain. I mostly did it for testing purpose as I was too lazy to extend the editor. 
13:47 < Dune> if you're going to build a custom editor you might be interested in basing it off the ongoing refactor
14:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Learath if the client has the random seed for the teleporter you could predict that
14:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> since you can have multiple "random generators" this should be doable
22:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Dune: ongoing refactor?
22:55 < Dune> heinrich5991, lordsk's; check forum
22:57 <@heinrich5991> Dune: must've missed it, care to link me?
22:57 <@heinrich5991> I can't find it
