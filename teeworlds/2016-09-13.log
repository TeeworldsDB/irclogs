16:37 < Neox> Hello! I implemented this anti spoof thing, but I keep getting timeouts. Does anybody know why?
16:37 < Neox> Also, if I enable debug mode, this is what I get
16:37 < Neox> [security]: invalid token (vanilla handshake)
16:38 <@heinrich5991> can you check what token you get and what is expected?
16:39 < Neox> Alright
16:40 < Neox> How can I print it's value? %d right?
16:40 <@heinrich5991> if it's an int, yes
16:41 < Neox> it's a SECURITY_TOKEN
16:41 < Neox> it's an int ok :)
16:43 < Neox> Got 2452, expected 821643851
16:43 < Neox> By the way I have a warning while compiling, and I get a timeout while I'm in game after 4-5 sec
16:43 < Neox> [1/2] [2] c++ src/engine/shared/network_server.cpp src/engine/shared/network_server.cpp: In member function 'SECURITY_TOKEN CNetServer::GetToken(const NETADDR&)': src/engine/shared/network_server.cpp:143:36: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules [-Wstrict-aliasing]   SecurityToken = *(SECURITY_TOKEN*)digest;
16:46 <@heinrich5991> that's indeed a programming error, but probably* not the bug right now
16:46 < Neox> Alright, I'll check at what I have copy pasted. Maybe I accidentally deleted something
16:46 <@heinrich5991> maybe check what the client sends
16:46 <@heinrich5991> and why it sends that
16:47 < Neox> Uhm.. how can I do that?
16:47 < Neox> The fact is that I'm really bad with this network stuff
16:47 <@heinrich5991> you can check what message the server expects for the network token
16:47 <@heinrich5991> then you can check where the client sends that
16:48 <@heinrich5991> and add a few dbg_msgs around that
16:49 < Neox> Well alright. But I'll first check at what I have implemented, I may have deleted a "+" accidentally.. I was replacing all the "+" while copying from github (but I was trying to let the ones that are in the code)
16:49 < Neox> You know when you add a line it's written "+" in the left in github, idk how to remove it so I just delete them
16:53 <@heinrich5991> ah yes, that's a patch
16:53 <@heinrich5991> you could try to apply it
16:56 < EastByte> Neox: it's kind of hard to help without code
16:56 < Neox> I guess so EastByte, I was wondering if you could possibly know from where it comes from
17:00 < Neox> I just disabled the anti spoof setting, and it's still happening. Do you have any ideas about where I can check?
17:12 <@heinrich5991> [17:11:59] <Neox> I definatly need help, if I knew where to search it could be ok, but as I said I disabled the thing and I still get a timeout. And East isn't even answering to my PMs :/
17:13 <@heinrich5991> if you PM once more, I'll ignore you
17:13 <@heinrich5991> do you use version control? if so, try reverting your changes and check if the timeout problem persists
17:13 <@heinrich5991> you can highlight persons in channels by writing their name to get their attention
17:21 < Stitch626> i hope heinrich5991 didnt ignore me because of PM
17:22 < Neox> Writing here is sending the message to everybody, why would I do that while I need only a few persons? I mean this is why I was PM'ing. But ok, as you wish
17:23 <@heinrich5991> because others might be interested or able to help
17:23 < Neox> Alright
17:31 <@heinrich5991> Neox: do you use version control?
17:33 < Neox> what is this?
17:33 <@heinrich5991> something like git
17:34 < Neox> No I don't, but I can get the version before this one (it's backed up)
17:34 < Neox> I mean before implementing the anti spoof thing
17:35 < Neox> East told me to send him three files, that he'll look at it. But if I can do anything to help to solve the problem, I'm ready
