10:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> hey @heinrich5991 do you have a collection for mapres, too? I know you have one for maps
10:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> or does anyone have a mapres extractor?
10:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> allright, google is my friend
10:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> okay, does anyone have the tower defense maps? (The ones with the castle(s)?) Or the mapres ðŸ˜„
10:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> got it
11:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Assa post a link to the tower defense maps
11:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @heinrich5991 i found them in your repository
11:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> http://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/MC_4.4_65b8c125.map
11:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> http://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/Tower_Defense_7.9_a2215548.map
11:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> MC stands for mountain castle
11:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Assa ddnet has a mapres extractor
11:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> already found one
11:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wisdom_of_the_ancients.png
11:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> These logs are public and archived as far as I know so positing a answer can be useful.
11:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> do you want the link to the mapres extractor i used?
12:04 < deen> You could just have used the map_extract.exe DDNet ships
12:05 < deen> just drag the map into it and the pngs get extracted
12:05 < deen> oh wait, this is teeworlds channel, not DDNet, oops.
12:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> does 0.7 require a border fix, too?
12:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> No
