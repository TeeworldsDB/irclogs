13:22 < allu2> Yo, is there any known vulnerability in TW that could allow attacket to get ip's of clients? http://i.imgur.com/B467VOv.png happened on ChickenServer2, first thought is that they had some way X of knowing clients ip's and then tested this by sending spoofed chat messages to make clients say the ip/port, then used that info to try guess rcon password
13:24 < allu2> I've tried to find if there was any rcon logins but didn't see anything suspecious there, next I checked my servers auth log but nothing but me there ether, also checked what I can from TeeBot but it simply can't talk to server to anyone in private so I'd think they would've notice if it had some how been tricked to leak the ip/ports :S
13:24 < EastBite> your ip address is public from the moment on, you are refreshing serverlist
13:24 < EastBite> so yea
13:25 <@minus> indeed
13:25 < allu2> I mean some player Z on my server managed to know the ip's of other clients on the server :S
13:25 < allu2> and I though this shouldn't be possible for anyone but the server or rcon users
13:25 < EastBite> it is possible
13:26 < EastBite> just needs a lot of trying
13:26 < allu2> ? thats seems bad :S
13:26 < EastBite> the teeworlds protocol isn't designed to security
13:27 <@minus> though the issue could very well stem from the mod
13:27 <@matricks> EastBite: how can you figure out the other players ip?
13:27 < EastBite> honeypot server
13:28 <@matricks> ahh
13:28 <@matricks> you can't know it, but it reduces the amount you need to search..
13:28 <@matricks> coo'
13:28 < EastBite> ^ spoofing a hundred ips doesn't take that long
13:28 <@minus> takes a second, literally
13:29 < EastBite> and there seems to be a problem with windows udp sockets
13:29 <@minus> i think i wrote about that once, not sure if published or not
13:29 < EastBite> often the same sourceport is being used
13:29 < allu2> Shortly after the server was filled with Dummy tee's from some Chinese addresses
13:29 <@matricks> sigh
13:30 < allu2> 175.30.209.1:1337, 175.30.209.0:1337, 175.30.209.2:1337 and so on..
13:30 <@minus> matricks: halp, i need 13 bytes encoded onto a base of 42 characters, how do i do that?
13:30 < Kottizen> How about giving all clients a randomly generated token, that they have to provide together with a password in order to even be considered let access to rcon?
13:30 <@matricks> Kottizen: I was about to say that
13:30 <@minus> i think heinrich5991 already did something on that front
13:30 <@matricks> yeah
13:30 <@matricks> security token on connect
13:31 <@matricks> to make sure you can't spoof randomly
13:31 <@matricks> you couldn't just exchange public keys etc
13:31 <@matricks> security... such a never ending battle
13:31 < allu2> Sounds nice, is it possible such feature could come officially before launch of 0.7 when ever that might be?
13:31 <@matricks> allu2: no
13:32 <@matricks> allu2: requires network change which means new version number
13:32 < allu2> awws
13:33 <@matricks> version number is major.network.patch
13:34 <@matricks> anything that changes the protocol needs to change the network number
13:34 < EastBite> matricks: there is another hacky way for such a handshake
13:34 <@matricks> but it also doesn't mean that there can be a 0.7 before the current 0.7 and that will become 0.8
13:34 < allu2> I'm just rather depressed when it comes to waiting next version number to be launched :P
13:35 < EastBite> pretenting a mapchange and expecting the right chunk requests from the client afterwards
13:35 < EastBite> or so
13:35 < Kottizen> Theoretically it could be made backwards compatible. A server admin could choose to enable it on their 0.6.4, and if enabled, only 0.6.4 clients can access rcon.
13:35 < allu2> That'd be nice
13:35 < Safa_[A_boy]> Hello. Can someone point me to the function that takes the string and draws it? I mean the text renderer
14:10 <@matricks> Safa_[A_boy]: engine/client/text.cpp
14:11 <@matricks> Safa_[A_boy]: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/0.6/src/engine/client/text.cpp#L551
14:11 < Safa_[A_boy]> Thanks! :)
14:49 < Safa_[A_boy]> So, When I try to type Arabic in the chat nothing got shown
14:49 <@matricks> ..
14:50 < allu2> matricks: adding arabic support on the todolist? :P
14:50 < Safa_[A_boy]> What did you do? :p
14:51 <@matricks> allu2: noo....
14:52 < Safa_[A_boy]> In previous releases It was shown, After I reinstalled teeworlds it disappeared
14:52 <@matricks> well, not on my todo list atleast...
14:52 <@matricks> if I were todo some language stuff on teeworlds... I would remove it all
14:52 < allu2> lol, no chat at all?
14:52 < Safa_[A_boy]> Only English, Not Arabic
14:52 <@matricks> I think I've voiced my opinion on this quite well
14:53 <@matricks> allu2: naa, just remove all translations etc
14:53 < Safa_[A_boy]> Dont get angry please :)
14:53 <@matricks> and remove the language support
14:53 < allu2> Ah, well I'm kind of person who appears here only when something is not working or is troubling me ^^
14:54 <@matricks> I've toyed with the idea to remove nick names, chat etc as well
14:54 <@matricks> remove custom skins and let the server random it
14:54 < Safa_[A_boy]> Remove the server too :)
14:54 <@matricks> thought about that as well
14:54 < allu2> Actually that doesn't sound all that bad when I think about it
14:55 <@matricks> focus on the game, less fluff
14:55 <@matricks> thought about doing a 128k version of teeworlds
14:55 < allu2> :D
14:55 < allu2> reminds me ov TW 1.0 somehow :P
14:56 <@minus> matricks: something like kkrieger?
14:57 <@matricks> yah
15:06 < Safa_[A_boy]> Looks like I just had to reboot my computer
15:21 < JulianAssange> allu2: might want to just heck your whole server for infection(a virus, not the mod :>)
15:21 <@matricks> *check
15:23 < JulianAssange> yes that
15:23 < JulianAssange> since if it's chinese, they probably have pwned your server, and are just messing with you
15:24 < JulianAssange> unless actually, the 'hackers' just cloned the names, waited for them to leave, then rejoined and printed out random IPs lol
15:25 < JulianAssange> screenshot doesn't show enough to know though
15:25  * matricks is never going todo multiplayer again
15:25 <@minus> why not :(
15:26 < EastBite> JulianAssange: there were cases like these on other servers aswell
15:26 <@matricks> fucking hassle
15:26 <@minus> no p2p multiplayer?
15:26 < EastBite> I will :D
15:26 <@matricks> minus: so much work for such small gains
15:26 <@matricks> minus: we had a discussion at the office today about multiplayer cheating etc
15:26 < EastBite> small gain?
15:26 <@minus> matricks: for science!
15:27 <@matricks> EastBite: the amount of work that is needed for a small game is insane
15:27 < EastBite> creating a multiplayer game always is like creating an own social world
15:27 <@matricks> and all the problems with hacking and cheating...
15:27 <@matricks> cheating in a single player game is like.. well, you are only cheating yourself
15:27 < EastBite> teeworlds does really well against cheating
15:28 < EastBite> even without anticheat mechanism
15:28 < JulianAssange> EastBite: cases of what
15:28 < JulianAssange> randomly joining and posting random ips?
15:28 < EastBite> spaming, rcon misuse, playerkicking, dos
15:29 < allu2> JulianAssange: I doubt the server itself is compromised (Ofcourse there is no way to be 100% sure) and I confirmed myself that the people who said their IPs did come from those and have been playing on the server without problems several times before
15:29 <@matricks> gonna do teeworlds 2... single player game
15:29 <@minus> ew
15:29 < EastBite> I'll make a mmorpg :3
15:29 <@minus> ._.
15:29 < botnik> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=._.
15:29 < EastBite> ._.
15:29 < botnik> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=._.

15:30 < JulianAssange> ._.
15:30 < botnik> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=._.
15:30 < JulianAssange> i know about the dos stuf(i'm the original reporter), but i haven't seen other stuff
15:30 < allu2> TeeBot2 logs all IPs and connection and leaving times of all players who join in the server, same information can also be confirmed from the servers own log file
15:30 <@matricks> I actually have ideas and plans how a singleplayer teeworlds would be
15:30 <@matricks> and we have actually done one version before
15:31 < allu2> EastBite: how about making Teeworlds based card game, card games seem popular thesedays :P
15:31 < EastBite> virtual card games...
15:31 < EastBite> matricks: what kind of ideas?
15:32 < JulianAssange> unless money is involved and you're in gibraltar, nothx
15:32  * allu2 uses the masterserver (reveals all tee's on the opponents hand)
15:32 <@matricks> allu2: I've been doing some thinking about that and you can make a card game p2p and still have the security and hidden cards
15:32 <@matricks> allu2: no need for servers etc
15:32 < allu2> I was visioning a card called "masterserver" ^^
15:32 < JulianAssange> yu-gi-oh
15:32 <@matricks> EastBite: how it would be structured, laws and rules of the world and progressio
15:33 < EastBite> roundbased still is p2p compatible, indeed
15:33 <@matricks> a game like hearth stone can be done without any thirdparty
15:33 <@matricks> and still prevent all cheating
15:34 < allu2> Would be cool :)
15:34 < Muttley> allu2, can it be the teebot has a vulnerability ?
15:34 < JulianAssange> send me teebot src and i'll look if you want
15:36 < allu2> It could be indeed, https://github.com/Allu2/TeeBot2
15:37 < JulianAssange> python
15:37 < JulianAssange> lol
15:37 < JulianAssange> probably is a vuln in that then
15:37 < allu2> But I doubt it because TeeBot can't speak ip's out without it being public
15:38 < allu2> it can use say/broadcast
15:38 < Muttley> anyone care to test me map ? gs01.digistrado.nl:9305
15:38 < JulianAssange> allu2: do you use port 1337 for this bot?
15:38 < allu2> Nope
15:38 < EastBite> how does the bot work?
15:38 < allu2> Bot works on localhost on server running the TW
15:38 < EastBite> econ?
15:39 < allu2> uses econ
15:39 < EastBite> k
15:39 < allu2> but as said, only in localhost while the econ port is blocked from outside
15:39 < JulianAssange> "port = 1337 (or what ever port you use)"
15:39 < JulianAssange> what does that port represent?
15:39 < allu2> Its the econ port of TW server
15:39 < allu2> the one that is blocked from outside by ufw/iptables
15:39 < JulianAssange> oh
15:40 < EastBite> ^ just bind it on localhost
15:41 < allu2> Still, Econ and the Bots connection should be save
15:41 < JulianAssange> just the reason I bring that up, is beause  the src ports were 1337 (175.30.209.1:1337, 175.30.209.0:1337, 175.30.209.2:1337)
15:41 < JulianAssange> that might be nothing though
15:41 < JulianAssange> since it;s si common
15:41 < allu2> Probably spoofed
15:41 < EastBite> of course spoofed
15:42 < JulianAssange> ^
15:42 < JulianAssange> i meant, deliberatly
15:43 < allu2> The main consern is if you can break out of bot's say/broadcast messages since thats the only time bot sends something to server that can include user crafted strings
15:44 < EastBite> why is teebot even dumping all that ips in global chat?
15:44 < EastBite> + sourceport
15:45 < allu2> EastBite: it doesn't
15:45 < EastBite> ah it's not teebot sry
15:45 < allu2> I'd assume someone is testing if they got the ip/port right witht heir spoofing
15:45 < EastBite> yea, I think so too
15:46 < JulianAssange> what;s the purpose of teebot anyways
15:46 < Muttley> quake like messages
15:46 < Muttley> xD
15:46 < allu2> Basicly print killing spree messages for now
15:46 < EastBite> without modding the server I guess
15:46 < JulianAssange> i don't know what means
15:46 < JulianAssange> oh
15:46 < allu2> and later when I feel like it I add "Double kill, Triplekill" and such
15:46 < Muttley> allu2, would be nice if you could add sounds ;-)
15:47 < allu2> That would be clientside thing :D
15:47 < EastBite> allu2: you might encourage people to use the ddnet client, since it uses a multiple randomized sourceport
15:47 < EastBite> the attack doesnt work there
15:49 < Muttley> allu2, what server version of tw are u using ?
15:49 < allu2> Hum I'd still like to avoid advising use of modded clients.. Any chanse that modification could be added to vanilla with minor version change?
15:49 < allu2> 0.6.3
15:49 < Muttley> ok
15:52 < EastBite> allu2: that would be nice of course
15:52 < allu2> Was thinking that if its backwards compatible it shouldn't be a problem, right?
15:52 < EastBite> but since there is barely any updating on the 0.6 branch, ddnet has become a 0.6 replacement with dozens of fixes
15:53 < EastBite> allu2: yea, no problem
15:54 < allu2> Is there some reason why this wouldn't be done? Or is it just lack of people to take of the changes fit them in and make a pull request?
15:54 < EastBite> the mian focus is on 0.7 I guess
15:54 < EastBite> main*
15:54 < JulianAssange> allu2: what is your server ip
15:55 < allu2> eh starts with 178... probably fastest to find it by searching ChickenServer and picking the 2 or 5
15:55 < JulianAssange> i don't have teeworlds atm
15:55 < allu2> ok let me get the address for you..
15:56 < allu2> 178.62.229.94
16:01 < JulianAssange> ok idk
16:04 < EastBite> hm was there a teeworlds modification which implemented collision damage?
16:04 < EastBite> should be pretty easy to impleme nt
16:05 < allu2> I'd like to see ammunition collision  :P blocking enemy grenades with pistol fire and stuff :D
16:05 < EastBite> I would love hooking grenades and throwing back :D
16:05 < JulianAssange> basketball mod has that
16:06 < JulianAssange> well
16:06 < JulianAssange> not w/ hook
16:06 < EastBite> :p
16:07 < allu2> Could bring some interesting new elements to the game ^^
16:10 < JulianAssange> http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/02/04/putin-aspergers-syndrome-study-pentagon/22855927/ thank u putin
