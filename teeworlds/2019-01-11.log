15:53 < Dune> hello
15:53 < Dune> Regarding https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1771: UI()->HotItem() == pID works
15:54 < Dune> but SetColor(1.f, 1.f, 1.f, 0.6f) doesn't change a damn thing
15:54 < Dune> maybe @Zatline will have an idea for something that looks better than https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/355114/51030578-33388600-159a-11e9-9a40-5ba1374c7f26.png ?
15:57 < Oy> looks fine i guess - similar to the radio buttons we have right?
15:57 < Dune> yeah - not sure why they are radio buttons by the way, they're not exclusive
15:58 < Dune> It seems that the alpha parameter is completely ignored though, it looks gray because I made it gray, not because it blends with the background
15:58 < Dune> I'm probably missing something
16:02 < Oy> have to fix setcolor. seems the alpha channel isn't multiplied with the other channels automatically
16:02 < Dune> when fixed, it will break a number of things, I beleive
16:02 < Dune> chat, namely
16:03 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/components/chat.cpp#L882 chat does it on function call
16:04 < Dune> yes, I remember having an argument with @LordSk about having to multiply ID boxes RGB by the alpha value
16:04 < Dune> sounds like we were both right :D
16:04 < Oy> :D
16:04 < Oy> seems half the code does it on fucntion call, and the other half not(no effect for these)
16:05 < Dune> yeah
16:05 < Dune> when that intended effect is "fixed" though, it looks somewhat worse I think
16:05 < Oy> for the checkbox?
16:05 < Dune> yes
16:07 < day> Dune: hi :)
16:07 < Dune> hey day :)
16:07 < Dune> https://i.imgur.com/OygjliE.png
16:08 < Oy> yeah, blend out the icon is a bit odd - feels like it's disabled/inactive or sth - which in fact it is not
16:08 < Dune> this is what it looks like with the "fix"
16:08 < Dune> yeah, it's odd
16:08 < Oy> odd
16:09 < Dune> my workaround is hacky though, I don't think it scales with different sizes of checkboxes
16:10 < Dune> would be better to use something like gui_buttons.png / HOVER
16:10 < Oy> yeah
16:36 < Oy> did u start on the setcolor function already? otherwise i'll do it
16:36 < Oy> Dune: 
16:36 < Dune> no
16:36 < Oy> ok
16:36 < Dune> doing listboxes
16:36 < Dune> https://i.imgur.com/UWgRvHx.png
16:37 < Dune> I really need some gfx, can't make it scale well with CUIRect
16:37 < Dune> or maybe I can if I drop round corners
16:39 < Oy> what would be the best hover effect?
16:39 < Oy> just the inside? but then u won't see it for a checked one
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you do kinda, because there is a gap
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> otherwise there could be some halo
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there is room for it given that there is a 2.f margin
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but it can be harder to achieve
16:43 < Dune> oops, accidental unnecessary bridge use
16:43 < Dune> here is what the halo looks like: https://i.imgur.com/MKvhmh6.png
16:43 < Dune> it's not amazing, I'll try to make it lighter
16:50 < Oy> is there a svg for it? i could try to add some hover part
16:54 < Dune> yes
16:54 < Oy> hm
16:57 < Dune> @Zatline ^
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i believe its in the gfx folder he shared
17:36 < Dune> yeah it is 
17:49 < Oy> Dune: http://www.solidfiles.com/v/L5gDkny3V2VYL
17:53 < Dune> that looks a bit dark to me
17:53 < Dune> I used 25% alpha
17:54 < Dune> ah well it can be tuned in the code - looks good otherwise
17:54 < Dune> But shouldn't it be white with a low alpha?
17:54 < Oy> it's the same alpha as the outlines
17:54 < Dune> ah, I see
17:55 < Oy> shall i make it white?
17:55 < Oy> btw. is the commit spammer broken?
17:55 < Dune> I think it's better
17:55 < Dune> yeah, reported to heinrich
17:55 < Dune> still works on discord
17:56 < Oy> ok
17:56 < Oy> sec
17:56 < Dune> (I don't have access to webhooks)
17:56 < Dune> might just be a mode to set on the channel though
17:58 < Oy> Dune: http://www.solidfiles.com/v/pWe6r5e8AnmQj
17:58 < Dune> @heinrich5991: There is a 0xc0007b error on Steam, possibly a broken win32 release https://steamcommunity.com/app/380840/discussions/0/1743355067134127472/
17:58 < Oy> white same alpha
17:58 < Dune> gotta try ingame
18:00 < Oy> think win7 has a 32bit and a 64 bit version
18:06 < Dune> yes
18:06 < Dune> Oy: https://imgur.com/a/MOP7VFw
18:07 < Oy> looks alright
18:07 < Dune> @Sonix: ^
18:09 < Dune> should the alpha be adjusted anyhow?
18:09 < Oy> either that or we have to change colour/alpha on the box when hovering
18:09 < Oy> for the complete thing?
18:09 < Dune> only for the hover element
18:09 < Dune> I thought of that, but if you adjust the alpha on the box, it has to be stronger when hovered
18:09 < Oy> you mean the complete line?
18:09 < Dune> meaning that by default it has <1 alpha
18:10 < Dune> no, just the box
18:10 < Dune> I could look at @LordSk's chat highlight code if you want a halo effect
18:11 < Oy> but the less alpha from before looked odd
18:11 < Dune> yes
18:11 < Oy> raiding the local liquor store. brb
18:12 < Dune> :D hf
18:20 < Dune> https://imgur.com/a/MOP7VFw
18:33 < Dune> https://imgur.com/a/QkyFWen
18:34 < Oy> that text highlight looks odd and doesn't fit with the other menu
18:36 < Dune> aight :)
18:38 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1969
18:39 < Dune> enough for https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1771?
18:39 < Dune> is MouseInside preferrable in any way?
18:43 < Dune> I wanna be able to do Button = View >> 20.0f; :D
18:44 < Dune> too bad there is no â†“ operator in C++
18:45 < Oy> hotitem should be fine
18:45 < Oy> :D
18:46 < Oy> should probably check if there are more items missing the hover effect
18:47 < Dune> can't think of any
18:48 < Oy> edit boxes
18:48 < Oy> scrollbars
18:48 < Oy> dropdown menus
18:49 < Oy> that seems all
18:50 < Oy> don't have demos, has the demo browser the hover effect too?
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> huh, good question
18:53 < Dune> should scrollbars have hover effects?
18:53 < Dune> I guess edit boxes could have a brighter bg
18:54 < Dune> huh I have demos but they don't show up
18:54 < Dune> looks like a bug
18:54 < Dune> yeah.. probably the new str functions
18:56 < Oy> yeah
18:56 < Oy> gonna check if there're more
18:56 < Dune> was about to say that :D
18:57 < Oy> scrollbars could have different alpha
18:57 < Oy> brighter bg for edit boxes sounds good
18:57 < Dune> aren't they 100% alpha already
18:57 < Oy> then different colour :D
18:58 < Dune> can't really make them grayer, that doesn't make too much sense
18:58 < Oy> mazbe bit darker when not hovering_
18:58 < Oy> ?
18:58 < Dune> gotta try
18:59 < Oy> maybe just the slider, so u see where to grab
19:00 < Dune> true, clicking outside of the slider has no effect right now
19:01 < Oy> the other str_endswith seem fine
19:01 < Dune> TIL sed on a git repo is not the brightest idea
19:07 < Dune> Some sed magic: https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/commit/d058efe2449234f092ba44bb066d9b9e0f258f64
19:07 < Dune> I wonder if there is a good way to make UI functions more intuitive :/
19:15 < Oy> guess the old one is better readable :P
19:15 < Dune> yeah
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> How big are the santa hats Oy?
19:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Attachments limit should be 50MB for you
23:22 <@heinrich5991> Dune: I think we only ship a 32bit version on windows
23:23 <@Dune> huh
23:23 <@Dune> then maybe we got mixed somewhere and uploaded 64bit
23:27 <@heinrich5991> $ file *
23:27 <@heinrich5991> config_directory.bat: ASCII text
23:27 <@heinrich5991> freetype.dll:         PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows

23:28 <@heinrich5991> looks mostly good to me, I don't know how to verify this on windows, but if you can, please do so ^^
23:28 <@heinrich5991> (the guy in the steam forum reportedly uses 64 bit windows anyway)
23:33 <@Dune> ah, I see
23:33 <@Dune> I wonder what causes 0xc00007b then
