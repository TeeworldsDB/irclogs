00:51 < MertenNor> hey.. want to test out juggernaut mod ? AndreasGan just remade it.. 
00:51 < MertenNor> or we are working on it..
00:52 < MertenNor> 81.166.25.152:8303
10:05 < AndreasGan> How do I get sdl working on windows when compiling 0.7?
10:05 < AndreasGan> Getting missing sdl.h
10:07 < AndreasGan> teeworlds/other/sdl folder does not have an include like the 0.6.3 source
10:08 < AndreasGan> nor the lib and dll files
10:10 <@minus> yeah, you need SDL development libraries/headers
10:10 <@minus> you can download them from the SDL site
10:10 < AndreasGan> where do I put them?
10:13 <@minus> in other/sdl i think
10:13 < AndreasGan> Hm, weird. Becuase when I did that I got a whole bunch of errors
10:17 < AndreasGan> like src/engine/client/input.cpp(76): error C3861: 'SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode': identifier not found
10:18 < AndreasGan> lots of undeclared and not found identifiers. Using libsdl 1.2.15
10:23 < AndreasGan> I needed sdl2
10:23  * AndreasGan facepalms
10:23 <@minus> really?
10:24 < AndreasGan> Yes, but then why does the other/sdl/VERSION say 1.2.15? 
10:24 <@minus> i thought SDL2 was not in teeworlds yet
10:33 < AndreasGan> Still getting errors though o.o
10:33 < AndreasGan> http://pastebin.com/raw/7DTsZkne
10:34 < AndreasGan> 0.6.3 source worked almost straight out of the box, why doesnt 0.7? :/
12:42 < AndreasGan> is it allowed to do if(pointer && pointer->child)?
12:42 < AndreasGan> I've always done if(pointer){ if(pointer->child) {
12:47 < AndreasGan> Wow. it worked - IVE MISSED OUT ON SO MUCH T_T
12:49 <@minus> you'll miss it even more when you hear of the nullcheck operator pointer?.child. noth in C++ tho.
12:49 <@minus> not*
12:51 <@minus> #define NN(x) if(x)x maybe
12:51 <@minus> NN(pointer)->child
12:58 <@heinrich5991> this definitely won't break in suprising ways :P
12:59 <@heinrich5991> if(foo) NN(bar)->keks; else something;
12:59 <@heinrich5991> (where keks is a german word, not derived from kek)
13:02 <@minus> #define NN(x) {if(x)x} if you so want
13:05 < koomi> that's even worse...
13:06 < koomi> do { foo } while (0) is pretty fail-safe
13:09 <@minus> why is that worse?
13:15 < koomi> it doesn't even parse
13:22 <@minus> oh right it doesn't work anymore then
14:01 <@heinrich5991> you could use gcc's statement-expression extension
14:01 <@heinrich5991> ah no, that wouldn't work here
14:02 < Dunedune> heinrich5991: +1 conversions to bool are cancer
14:04 <@minus> well, could always write a preprocessor
14:26 <@heinrich5991> meh
14:26 <@heinrich5991> vlc gives me weird sound and all other media players only give me the first frame of the video output
14:35 <@minus> corruped video then
14:36 <@heinrich5991> I forgot to mention that this applies to all videos
14:37 <@minus> video acceleration + broken drivers?
14:37 <@minus> have you tried rebooting?
14:37 <@heinrich5991> maybe
14:37 <@heinrich5991> no
14:37 <@heinrich5991> I haven't
14:37 <@heinrich5991> the vlc stuff works across reboots though
14:37 <@heinrich5991> (or doesn't, depending how oyu look at it)
14:37 <@minus> try disabling video acceleration, using a different renderer
14:38 <@heinrich5991> ok
14:38 <@minus> or run it from console and look at the error messages maybe
14:40 <@heinrich5991> 5 second test video result for vlc: https://gist.github.com/heinrich5991/32e36146e32d20714e1421d67df5473f
14:40 <@heinrich5991> it looks like some audio problem, constantly switching audio sink
14:40 <@heinrich5991> for the video problem, I got from mplayer: [ASPECT] Warning: No suitable new res found!; [VD_FFMPEG] DRI failure.
14:42 <@heinrich5991> I'll try to reboot
14:51 <@heinrich5991> minus: reboot worked for non-vlc players. ty :)
19:21 < andreasgan> Anyone want to try out my mod? Need to test it :)
19:21 < MertenNor> Server: 81.166.25.152:8303
19:22 < andreasgan> ^
19:22 < andreasgan> 0.6.3
19:29 <@heinrich5991> me!
19:53 < andreasgan> heinrich5991: Thanks for joining :)
20:05 < Funni> i'm in
20:11 < Funni> nice with a juggernaut
20:26 <@heinrich5991> minus: one can't connect to tw.com on windows xp with internet explorer :D
20:37 <@minus> good. you shouldn't be using xp
20:49 <@heinrich5991> ddnet said that they receive quite some traffic from winxp, probably because teeworlds runs on old computers
20:49 <@heinrich5991> maybe we can fix the winxp connectivity :)
20:50 <@heinrich5991> https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=www.teeworlds.com&hideResults=on
20:55 <@minus> well, it works with browsers other than IE
20:55 <@minus> IE 6 is definitely a no (no TLS)
20:56 <@minus> IE 8 probably needs some shitty cipher
20:56 <@heinrich5991> even ssllabs supports ie8 :)
20:57 <@minus> no SNI either
20:57 <@minus> i doubt downloads would work then
20:57 <@heinrich5991> the certificate is for all of downloads., www., teeworlds.com
20:58 <@minus> the downloads are hosted on my server and i doubt anything works there without SNI
21:16 < urraka> even if you are on XP.. don't use IE6 ffs
21:35 <@heinrich5991> urraka: ie6 won't be supported anyway, it doesn't even have tls
21:36 <@heinrich5991> minus: you're right, the downloads server breaks it
21:36 <@heinrich5991> no need to try to support it on the main site then
22:40 < andreasgan> What was actually in the 0.6.4 update that's never coming out?
22:41 <@heinrich5991> mh
22:41 <@heinrich5991> I actually don't remember anymore
22:41 <@heinrich5991> lemme check
22:47 <@heinrich5991> andreasgan: some protection against ip spoofing
22:49 < andreasgan> Oh, thanks. Then why did it require all the languages to update?
22:50 <@heinrich5991> I guess that's just because the 0.6.3 release was a bit hectic
22:50 <@heinrich5991> security issue
