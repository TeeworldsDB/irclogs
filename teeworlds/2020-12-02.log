01:14 < minus> yo, who the fuck is signing up forum@teeworlds.com for blogs
01:18 <@Dune> that's what it's like to make free games targeted to children huh
15:39 < ChillerDragon> there is no way for a client component to do something when the client quits right? can we get a opposte to OnInit something like OnQuit here https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/f743aa1efd7f6c6b411a0639fa954d3cbd482de5/src/game/client/component.h#L36-L47
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> what about destructor
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> we should add it if there is a use for it
15:40 < ChillerDragon> oh yea 
15:41 < ChillerDragon> destructor is a good idea thanks :)
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> :)
15:42 < ChillerDragon> ah lol i just realized i dont need it :D
15:42 < ChillerDragon> but still good to know :D
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> nice
17:22 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: does OnStateChange work?
17:22 <@heinrich5991> I think it has a state QUITTING or so
17:23 < ChillerDragon> i also thought about that but did not test anyways destructor is fine i guess also i dont need it :D
17:23 < ChillerDragon> but heinrich5991 since your here any advice on how to do file encryption in tw code?
17:24 < ChillerDragon> totally not creating ransomware clients here 
17:25 <@heinrich5991> well, what are you trying to achieve with encryption?
17:25 <@heinrich5991> who do you want to protect against?
17:25 < ChillerDragon> password manager
17:25 < ChillerDragon> for rcon pws etc
17:25 <@heinrich5991> for a master password?
17:25 < ChillerDragon> ye
17:26 < ChillerDragon> well user enters master pw and then it unlocks the file
17:26 < ChillerDragon> classic i guess
17:26 < ChillerDragon> file contains all the rcon pws
17:26 < ChillerDragon> can i use any crypto we already have in the codebase?
17:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> do we have any crypto?
17:28 < ChillerDragon> well we have the sha thingys
17:28 < ChillerDragon> idk baut crypto
17:28 < ChillerDragon> isnt openssl crypto
17:28 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L369
19:35 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: libsodium would probably work well
19:35 < ChillerDragon> its not in tw code i guess?
19:35 <@heinrich5991> not yet
19:35 < ChillerDragon>  :D ?
19:36 < ChillerDragon> i would like my code to be portable as a client module that can be slapped into any codebase im sure it should work with openssl which is in tw and ddnet
19:37 <@heinrich5991> openssl is in teeworlds?
19:37 < ChillerDragon> ye
19:37 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/f743aa1efd7f6c6b411a0639fa954d3cbd482de5/CMakeLists.txt#L369
19:37 < ChillerDragon> or am i reading this wrong?
19:37 < ChillerDragon> didnt u put it there?
19:38 <@heinrich5991> this is using the crypto functions from openssl if they're available
19:38 <@heinrich5991> i.e. probably only on linux
19:38 < ChillerDragon> hm
19:38 < ChillerDragon> and what was that mysterious "not yet"
19:39 < ChillerDragon> any plans on adding libsodium?
19:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no. but you could add it
19:40 < ChillerDragon> wat? xd
19:40 < ChillerDragon> this is a feature for my custom client because ddnet said no way this is getting in ddnet
19:40 < ChillerDragon> are you saying i should pr it for vanilla? :D
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> is there anything we want crypto for in teeworlds?
19:42 <@heinrich5991> no, I meant that you could add it to the project you're doing
19:44 < ChillerDragon> im not rly interested in touching other files than my component to make merges less struggle
19:45 < ChillerDragon> yea ill see i think plaintext is fine for now :D maybe some day ill give openssl another try it somewhat worked already
19:45 <@heinrich5991> writing a sensible crypto algorithm with openssl without being a seasoned cryptographer is probably tough
19:46 <@heinrich5991> might as well use plain text
19:46 < ChillerDragon> ye
19:46 <@heinrich5991> wdym by "plain text" btw. some interoperable file format or "I'll just roll my own"? :P
19:46 < ChillerDragon> i wonder why crypto is hard if already using a lib to do all the work
19:47 < ChillerDragon> i use comma seperated txt files currently 
19:47 < ChillerDragon> one could call it following the CSV "standard" :D
19:47 <@heinrich5991> how do you deal with commas in fields?
19:47 <@heinrich5991> ^^
19:47 < ChillerDragon> i don't have commas in the fields :P
19:47 < ChillerDragon> hostname,dummy,password
19:48 <@heinrich5991> password can't have commas?
19:48 < ChillerDragon> i parse 2 commas and then im done password could contain commas but i ignore them
19:48 < ChillerDragon> it can
19:48 <@heinrich5991> ok, so not csv
19:48 < ChillerDragon> yea
19:49 <@heinrich5991> you could implement csv by double-quoting the field if it contains a comma or a double-quote, and replacing double-quotes with two double-quotes
19:49 < ChillerDragon> ik
19:49 < ChillerDragon> but why would i
19:49 <@heinrich5991> to have a standard file format
19:49 < ChillerDragon> sounds like a lot of work and complexity and more ways to fuck it up
19:49 < ChillerDragon> why do i profit from a standard file format
19:50 <@heinrich5991> easier to read from other implementations
19:50 < ChillerDragon> yes
19:50 <@heinrich5991> easier to extend if you need more fields
19:50 < ChillerDragon> it still easy
19:50 < ChillerDragon> also no need for other implementations
19:51 < ChillerDragon> in all these easy script languages following standards is fun but in c++ meh
19:51 <@heinrich5991> well then c++ sucks I guess
19:51 < ChillerDragon> oof
19:52 <@heinrich5991> (note that there's a partial implementation of csv in ddnet already; writing is implemented)
19:52 < ChillerDragon> oh wow why?
19:52 <@heinrich5991> ddnet-saves.txt
19:52 < ChillerDragon> what is it
19:53 < ChillerDragon> passwords for /save?
19:53 < ChillerDragon> nah
19:53 <@heinrich5991> yes
19:53 < ChillerDragon> wat
19:53 < ChillerDragon> we have that?
19:53 <@heinrich5991> yes
19:53 < ChillerDragon> how to use it
19:53 <@heinrich5991> type /save <code> anywhere
19:53 <@heinrich5991> the code is saved into the file
19:53 <@heinrich5991> done
19:53 < ChillerDragon> oh
19:53 < ChillerDragon> not bad
19:54 < ChillerDragon> thats half of my password manager already xd
22:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @anyonewhoknowshowfuckingenvelopesworkpleaseineedinformation
22:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 
22:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> So, I wanted to know if it is possible to make a day/night cycle using envelopes that is synced between clients, no matter when the client was started, the server was joined or when the tee touched the start/finish line.
22:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is that possible? (Notice: My server is playable from 0.7 and 0.6 (DDNet only, not vanilla))
22:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> make the envelope "synced" I think
22:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut ^
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Would it work for 0.7?
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> is that some hack?
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or ddnet-noly
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> only*
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> synced means it's based on server time
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> is it a feature that also exists in 0.7?
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> synced? yes
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it's a TW feature IIRC
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> cant find it in 0.7 editor
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> only in ddnet
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oh no
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> wait
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i found it :D
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i will try it out, thanks alot
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 mh, doesnt seem to work correctly. My server modifies the game start tick in order to show race time. 
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> with Synchronized being enabled, the animation is always synced for 0.7 and 0.6 clients, but as soon as passing the start line the server resets the gamestart tick for that player of course, so its at 0:00, but it only affects 0.7 clients, as their animation will reset but DDNets animation will just continue to be synced
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> why is that? gamestarttick should not affect envelopes anymore, like in DDNet i think
