22:48 < med> hi 
22:48 <@heinrich5991> hi
22:48 < med> i like the game teeworlds 
22:49 <@heinrich5991> me too :)
22:49 < med> its very good looking and have nice graphics
22:49 < med> any devs
22:49 < med> ?
22:49 < med> i mean is there any developpers here ?
22:49 < Obani> Of course
22:50 < Obani> But the game in itself is not what we could tell an actively developped game
22:50 < Obani> It has an active modding community thought
22:50 < Obani> There's a pretty neat fork going on there too ninslash.com
22:50 < med> game like that should be imported to android
22:50 < Obani> med, it is on android
22:50 < Obani> But it sucks really hard
22:50 < med> hmm
22:51 < med> ii didn't any version , what did you use as engine ?
22:51 < Obani> Once you get to be what we could tell a "pro player" on teeworlds, android port becomes an atrocity :p
22:51 < Obani> med, engine for what ?
22:51 < med> for the game on android 
22:51 < necropotame> SDL
22:54 < med> didn't know that until now ,and is there any version going for html5
22:54 < Obani> med, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teeworlds
22:54 < Obani> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ninslash.com
22:55 < Henningstone> med: https://teewebs.net/
22:55 < med> very good
22:58 < med> intro for me , i am web developper ,made plugins for wordpress ,themes ,php , js , maps i am think of changing career to making games :) ,any advice ?
23:00 < med> Obani any advice ?
23:02 < Obani> I'm not what we could call a developper actually
23:02 < Obani> med, godotengine.org
23:03 <@minus> from an outsider point of view, being game dev does not seem fun, but certainly better than webdev
23:04 < med> hmmm ,minus you got that right 
23:04 < med> ;o
23:04 < Obani> yes it is
23:04 < necropotame> But your working conditions can be worst
23:05 < Obani> depends
23:05 <@minus> keyword crunch time
23:05 < med> every one have to start somewhere 
23:07 < med> rpg or multiplayer which is best ?
23:08 < Obani> med, just make your things
23:08 < Obani> I think there's way more than rpg or multiplayer
23:12 < med> very good ,thank you all Obani ,minus , Henningstone ,heinrich5991 , necropotame 
23:13 < med> take care ;)
