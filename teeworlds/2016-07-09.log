12:35 < Obani> Hey guys
12:36 < Obani> Can I make a vote call ?
12:36 < Obani> It's about an organization I'm being part of that hosts online free-games servers
12:37 < EastByte> do you mean a vote call via ingame interface or via cmd line?
12:37 < Obani> EastByte, via a wordpress website
12:37 < Obani> EastByte, in fact the vote is over :(
12:37 < Obani> I think I woke up too late to make the vote call :/
12:39 < EastByte> via a wordpress website?
12:39 < Obani> EastByte, yeah, via a plugin
12:39 < Obani> wanna take a look ?
12:39 < Obani> It started as hosting Minetest Servers, but then it expanded to Warsow and Teeworlds
12:40 < Obani> And the vote was for the next game(s) to host
12:40 < Obani> It seems like it will be ManaWorld and Xonotic/OpenDungeons
12:41 < EastByte> ah
12:42 < EastByte> well, I think it's not a good idea to provide teeworlds servers for free
12:43 <@heinrich5991> mh. care to explain?
12:44 < EastByte> me?
12:44 <@heinrich5991> yes
12:44 < EastByte> well, there already are too many empty servers
12:44 < EastByte> and once you get players there will be DDoS attacks
12:45 < EastByte> so it might be bad for the organization aswell
12:50 < Obani> EastByte, well the DDOS protection is kinda good
12:51 < EastByte> what hosting provider are they using?
12:51 < Obani> Many people already tried to make us this kind of attacks, but they weren't heavy enough
12:51 < Obani> EastByte, OVH
12:51 < Obani> In Canada
12:52 < EastByte> my experience with OVH and DDoS against gameservers is mostly bad
12:53 < Obani> EastByte, well from what the hoster said me, it depends on the location
12:53 < Obani> And in Canada, protection is better than in other places
12:57 < EastByte> so the organization is aiming for american players
12:57 < EastByte> I guess that wouldn't be so bad since most of the trolls are living in Europe
12:58 < EastByte> the teeworlds community in the USA isn't so big unfortunatly
13:25 < Obani> EastByte, I agree with that
13:25 < Obani> And the server is not at all pointing at American players :/
13:25 < Obani> But there many DDOSes forced us to go to that host place
14:42 < needs1> EastByte: Never had DDos issues with OVH on my teeworlds servers, what happened?
14:43 < needs1> It was vanilla only servers
15:34 < Obani> needs1, seems like it depends on the location of the server
15:34 < Obani> needs1, I mean the DDOS protection is better in some place than in others
15:34 < Obani> But it influences the ping :/
15:42 < needs1> I'm curious
15:42 < needs1> never had any noticable DDos other than SSH bot tried stupid password everey now and then
15:42 < needs1> *trying
15:49 < Obani> On teeworlds maybe
17:22 < EastByte> needs1: ovh is acting really weird once the ddos mitigation mode starts
17:22 < EastByte> there is random packet-loss, some people will be kicked and/or cannot connect
17:22 < EastByte> others can play just fine
17:24 < needs1> EastByte: Oh okay, it might sometimes explain why my servers where unstable
17:25 < needs1> *were sometime
22:59 <@minus> next year is teeworlds' 10th anniversary
23:00 <@minus> we wanted to get 0.7 out for its 5th anniversary :/
