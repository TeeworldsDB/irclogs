11:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Has anyone actually tested the newly added joystick support to teeworlds?
12:11 <@Dune> day: ^
12:17 < day> nah doesnt work for me. cursor goes apeshit in the menu :P
12:18 < day> and after i realized for the 2nd time that it's not gonna work ergonomically on an xbox360 controller i didn't pursue it
12:20 <@Dune> we need to know those things :p
12:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I was going crazy not knowing why my cursor was moving on its own
15:33 < rand> about joystick, should it be better to use the xy information of joystick as position of the pointer ?
15:33 < rand> (i'm not used to game with joystick and pointer)
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I mean navigating teeworlds menus with a joystick is going to be a nightmare to implement
15:52 < rand> right
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> We should probably only "support" gameplay with it
15:53 < rand> but is the mouse handle the same way for both ? (menu and ingame)
15:58 <@Dune> you can just make menus more accessible with the keyboard
15:58 <@Dune> I think @PatrykP had a proposal for that
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> And also rand, the current implementation moves the mouse cursor position
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> but I could not "click" on anything though
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> maybe I missed something
16:27 <@Dune> you're definitely supposed to be able to @LordSk
16:28 < rand> CControls::OnMouseMove : m_MousePos += vec2(x, y); // TODO: ugly
16:28 < rand> well
16:28 < rand> do we want a OnJoystickMove ?
