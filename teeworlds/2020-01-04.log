00:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yo, I need some help... I tried to apply my own input to another player, its all working pretty fine, but the mouse target position very, very often "resets" to somewhere bottom-right. Does anyone know why?
00:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I noticed that it happens less on a LAN server
00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 where? How do you define â€žin gameâ€œ for me in game sounds like being in the game and even spectators could be excluded from that definition. Or are you talking about slots in the master or what exactly?
00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> To my msg: I tried basically everything to fix it, but couldnt get it..
00:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> non spectator team
00:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is for me considered ingame
00:09 < rand> econ clients are almost invisible from anyone (that is, except admin)
00:12 < rand> the maximum number of econ clients is defined by the constant NET_MAX_CONSOLE_CLIENTS as 4
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, ok
00:12 < rand> you may have 64 players plus 4 econ clients
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thx
00:15 < rand> @fokkonaut: bottom right looks like infinite positive values as mouse input
00:15 < rand> I think I got this issue because of wrong computations
00:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> mh? 11
00:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> mh? ^^
00:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> > I think I got this issue because of wrong computations
00:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> > wym
00:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> > I think I got this issue because of wrong computations
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> wym
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well, it is not always the same positon, just around bottom right somewhere
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> there is also a small range where it wouldnt reset, if i manually put the target near bottom right
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its very weird
00:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> wait, new diagnosis xd
00:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> jusst tested something
00:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea no its like that^ but when i put the mouse too close to my tee it will always reset to the same position again, not completely bottom right, a bit more to the tee, but still on the diagonal. but if i put the target somewhere else it will just go kinda to bottom right
00:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if you want you can test it out, my server is running
02:02 < day> Chillerdragon: you may wanna put this z7 bot on a ban list idk
03:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> okay so i have found it, the cause of this weird "resetting" is, that i send the CNetObj_SpectatorInfo, to properly update the viewpos.
03:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if i dont send spectatorinfo, the target doesnt reset. but if i dont send it it doesnt make sense since the camera doesnt follow the other tee
03:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But still weird that the target resets
03:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> doesnt make sense, client is okay too. i cant find where this behavior comes from yet
03:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i know in which function now, but still
03:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `if(length(m_MousePos) > MouseMax)
03:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut>             m_MousePos = normalize(m_MousePos)*MouseMax;`
03:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 
03:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> client/components/controls.cpp#241
03:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> there the error comes from.
03:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no, sorry xd
03:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> xd
03:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> okay cool, if i comment out client/controls.cpp#L142 `ClampMousePos();`, then the bug doesnt appear anymore AND the mosuepos is still clamped, because `ClampMousePos();` gets called in CControls::OnRender() too, every tick.
04:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so that means, since the mouse pos is still clamped BUT this reset bug doesnt happen, that between the clampmousepos call in onrender and the sending of the mousepos somthing happens with the mosuepos
04:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> because after the call of clampmousepos from the snapinput function, the input is instantly applied
04:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I doubt we need the ClmapMousePos call in SnapInput
04:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/055685406afc7b726f0126f0efc96bc6302da7b6#diff-c41ff3a713742e1dae8932366f246bc9
04:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 
04:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> this commit adds it. I tested the dynamic camera on spec player, and it works fine without that line. gonna PR
05:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> cant this be closed? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/158
09:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I donâ€™t like bans day :/ you can write !disconnect in chat and he will disconnect and also z7 leaves the server when there are more than 3 players online. It is there to keep nameless tees busy and bring live to the game.
10:00 < rand> who/what is z7 ?
11:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> my bot that walks around randomly and has a crappy aimbot
12:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @fokkonaut read the last comments of the issue
12:49 < Learath2> Dune: do you happen to be here per chance?
13:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Learath2:
13:02 < Learath2> Do you happen to be familiar with the stl containers?
13:03 < Learath2> I have a container that I'm retro-fitting to behave like an stl one but section 23 of the standard isn't exactly easy to read
13:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I'm not familiar with the standard, sorry :/
14:36 < rand> @ChillerDragon I'll be whatching it closely, (beware of master rule, keep it dumb enough)
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> which master rule exactly rand?
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> around player counts resembling actual players, probably
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and how is a actual player defined?
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> human being
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> uff
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> then i am breaking the rule :/
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't know what your bot does
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it connects
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and plays
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and is non human
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what servers does it join?
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> servers with active players?
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it joins and leaves if player count exceeds 3 or 4 or someone writes !disconnect in chat and then it reconnects after 60 minutes to check again
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it joins a vanilla server
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> sounds okayish
15:17 < Dune_> @ChillerDragon "The player count shown must resemble the amount of human players."
15:17 < Dune_> Wanted to touch a word about this
15:18 < Dune_> The bot tag is made for this
15:18 < Dune_> But of course, there is the issue that you cannot set the bot tag without modifying the source, and then you cannot use the CTF gametype string :/
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you cannot set it from the client, I think intentionally so
15:19 < Dune_> Yes heinrich5991
15:20 < Dune_> I don't see a good solution, maybe you do?
15:21 <@heinrich5991> I don't, short of doing something global
15:22 < Dune_> So keep the status quo
15:22 < Dune_> It is abusable though
15:22 <@heinrich5991> yes
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune which?
15:31 < Dune_> after https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/158#issuecomment-488256976
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ah, yes
15:38 < Dune_> when there is a usability issue, it is good to list the desirable use cases
15:38 < Dune_> we want 
15:38 < Dune_> - no user ids
15:38 < Dune_> - user ids with no nameplates
15:38 < Dune_> is there a benefit to "user ids with nameplates"?
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Well
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> for vanilla servers maybe because people can have the same name
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But i could (if wanted) add the ddnet auto rename to (x)name
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i applied it on my server too, it also checks for confusables, such as small L and big i
15:40 < Dune_> Maybe there is a pretty way to go about it, yeah
15:40 < Dune_> should be discussed 
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i activate ids only in debug mode and only look at the ids in the nameplates like in the old days ðŸ™‚
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> btw i challange you guys to reproduce this log on a vanilla server hehe
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/663032192791871498/unknown.png
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the usability of ids in nicknames is for administrative purposes and so that I can spot enemies faster, as their nicknames are wider.
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or rather nameplates
16:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon my guess is `force_vote no"`
16:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> eh
16:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> `vote no"`
16:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://www.xkcd.com/859/
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @oy, can you merge https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2361?
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @oy, can you merge https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2361 ?
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @oy, can you merge https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2361 ?
16:32 < Oy> fokkonaut, hm, dunno if that other clamp is needed, probably have to test
16:35 < rand> @ChillerDragon player count or vanilla gameplay, depending of the complainer feelings, I did shutdown angelina()/bot() because of this :c 
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @oy i tested it and it is not required.
16:36 < rand> server bots might be implemented nicely one day and pushed to upstream for vanilla gameplay
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if you'd like i can show you what the bug is, and you can test that this doesnt affect the other fix but will help my problem
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xdd new achievement, i just closed an issue thats about 5.5 years old with this tee stuck pr xd
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> idk probably @heinrich5991 xd
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> he made that issue
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rand i did not understand what you wanted to say when talking about player count and feelings
16:41 < Oy> @fokkonaut the commit i did might have been not just about the issue it closed. there used to be camera bugs in survival gametypes too
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But this can't affect it
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Well, you can test I guess?
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> because i dont know which one you are talking about
16:45 < rand> @ChillerDragon about player report ^^ servers are banned whenever sby reports it with a valid reason
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm i see
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i guess day just did?
16:51 < rand> no, you should know by staying here ^^
16:51 < Dune_> > rand:server bots might be implemented nicely one day and pushed to upstream for vanilla gameplay
16:51 < Dune_> that would be the best solution
16:52 < Dune_> to allow somehow servers to implement bots and report them as such
16:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i have serverside bots
16:53 < rand> your bot is far more discreet than mine and I shutdown mine as a safety measure
16:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> they can also move, but they dont have an AI they have hardcoded ways based on coords xd
16:53 < rand> @fokkonaut nice, do they move smoothly ?
16:53 < Dune_> @fokkonaut but you don't run vanilla servers so you don't have the issue
16:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes, you can check them out
16:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> true
16:54 < rand> iirc, bot|royal moved with hard coded path and some waypoints
16:54 < Dune_> iirc they did yeah
16:54 < Dune_> zomb bots don't but they cheat :p
16:55 < rand> what do you mean ?
16:55 < Dune_> they get extra double jumps when they struggle
16:55 < Dune_> wink @LordSk
16:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> wink wink
16:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> wink wink
16:57 < rand> xD
16:57 < rand> that explains a lot
17:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> they don't hook so when they need to go up, they fly
17:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @oy when will you be able to make a decision on that pr? if possible id like to have a fix for this before the next rls :) _(dont wanna push too much, sorry ^^)_
17:20 < Oy> definitely before next release :)
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ^^
17:31 < Oy> any opinions about https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2359 ?
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]> 1- why
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]> 2-... why
17:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ^
17:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> is there a gameplay reason to add these?
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> for my side, yes
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Check the conversation
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (in the issue)
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]> There should be a workaround
17:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]> To add them in a mod
17:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]> But on vanilla its pretty useless
17:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> of course, but this is required to display them
17:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> otherwise client doesnt know about them
17:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so this is the base thats required to ever use them
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> honestly why not, it does not hurt the game and is consistent with the other weapons
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> !
17:48 < Oy> anyone wants to fight some zombies?
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ?
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]> Yes but i only play 0.6
17:53 < Dune_> the new zombs are only on 0.7 :p
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> im in favour of those pickups
17:53 < Dune_> I'd come but we need @Sonix to win a round :D
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]> Fine i will join
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> @fokkonaut doesnt it need a tile on the map editor?
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes, but since that isnt used in vanilla in any way the modded server can add it themselves i guess?
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in v anilla it wouldnt make sense to have those tiles
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> i think we should add them
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i dont think so. this is only to let the client show them again. i have added those tiles for myself, but dont use them, just use the pickups for dropped weapons
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> tiles are not needed, if someone really needs them they have an easy possibilty to add them. But this right here is needed to make that
19:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> )
19:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> teeworlds race is missing a finish sound ^^
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes :)
20:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe a start sound, too
20:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> but nothing sounds weird
21:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> teeworlds race is missing a server side implementation in vanilla
21:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol
21:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> vanilla now basically supports mods
21:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> a full official server mode would be a lot of work
21:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> mods already do that well so it's not very useful imo
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> can we have other mods supported in vanilla
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's basically the next question that follows
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> we just need checkpoints, start and finish
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what's so hard about doing this?
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> clean code maybe?
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you could even do some real race with rounds
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *laps
21:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there's an open issue to do this
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> las question qould be, can we have the ddnet client instead of vanilla ðŸ˜®
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *evil*
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> booring
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]> no
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]> ddnet / ddrace destroyed teeworlds on 0.6
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]> there is like 200 ddrace servers, we need more mod diversity
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> unfortunately, teeworlds pvp is a bit of a lonely experience
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> people who stick around in a game tend to be those who can have a social experience
