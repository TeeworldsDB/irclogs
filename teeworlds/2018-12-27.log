00:12 < koomi> heinrich5991: occasionally, mostly public vanilla
11:22 < Francesca_> hello
11:22 <@heinrich5991> hi
11:23 < Francesca_> hello heinrich5991, how are you? Francesca from italy here
12:34 < Francesca_> hello
12:53 <@Dune> hi
12:56 < Francesca_> hello Dune, how are you?
12:56 <@Dune> well, thanks. looking for something?
12:57 < Francesca_> oh, i was here to meet new people
12:57 <@Dune> we play teeworlds here, want to come?
12:58 < Francesca_> oh, what is that?
12:58 <@Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/
12:59 < Francesca_> oohh, i see!
17:58 <@Dune> good job on the automapper, Oy :) quite easy to port the rules
18:01 < Oy> Lordsk created the automapper :P
18:01 < Oy> i just changed it to json files i think :)
18:02 <@Dune> yeah I just meant the json extractor port is nice :)
18:02 < Oy> thx :)
18:03 < Oy> though it could be improved
18:03 < Oy> to add templates for types
18:03 < Oy> f.e. "top"
18:03 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/814
18:03 <@Dune> not much left there
18:04 <@Dune> json has no comments :(
18:04 <@Dune> should it be closed? or what remains?
18:05 < Oy> add a sub-object "comments" and then add your comment to it?
18:05 <@Dune> ah, right
18:05 <@Dune> forgot I can do that
18:05 < Oy> i think the rules should be improved
18:06 <@Dune> I'm in the process of doing that
18:06 < Oy> if u check a bottom tile right now u set current po to empty and y+1 to filled
18:06 < Oy> there should be bottom instead
18:06 < Oy> ok
18:06 <@Dune> huh
18:07 <@Dune> I'm not sure if I understand
18:08 < Oy> let me search an example
18:14 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/datasrc/editor/automap/grass_main.json#L262 here u check if y- and x-1 are empty
18:15 < Oy> some template "TopLeftCorner" instead would be better
18:16 < Oy> hope u catch my drift :)
18:16 <@Dune> ah well yeah :) would be much more readable
18:19 <@Dune> I'm hoping to motivate people to make more automapper rules :)
18:19 <@Dune> if they follow, then it'll be worthwhile to improve it like that
18:20 < Oy> yeah, and then the rules could also be more specific. right now the automapper checks one tile twice. a tile could get a wrong index which will be fixed in the second run
18:20 <@Dune> oh, I see
18:20 < Oy> f.e. the "topleftcorner" could check if y+1 is full and x+1 is full instead
18:21 < Oy> additionally to the rules that are set right now
18:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I don't even know how to start
18:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> creating rules ðŸ˜„
18:24 < Oy> :D
18:25 <@Dune> @Sonix open datasrc\editor\automap\grass_main.json
18:25 <@Dune> each block prefixed by "index: " is a rule
18:25 <@Dune> below are the conditions. x:0 y:-1 value:empty means the tile below must be empty
18:26 < Oy> some editor gui would be nice- open an image and then set "this is a corner tile", "this is a floor tile" etc.
18:27 <@Dune> yeah, but it might be a lot of work
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> @Dune really good job at that ingame automapper
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> and doodads aren't even there yet :D
22:30 <@Dune> no spoiler tags on teeworlds.com :(
22:33 < minus> trinteeeeeeeeee
22:33 < minus> +i
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Is there any good tutorial about auto-mapper?
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> any tutorial actually
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I'm writing it right now
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> hmm, okay
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> just thinkin, maybe I could try to make web-base version, for auto-mapper
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> im mor web dev than software.. ðŸ˜„
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I will try current automapers anyway
22:43 <@Dune> @Savander https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=122322#p122322
22:43 <@Dune> @Sonix too :)
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> hey, @Dune  typo in tutorial
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> ```"above" translates as:
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> 
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> "x": 0, "y": 1```
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> should b -1
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> be*
22:48 <@Dune> oh right thanks :)
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> ðŸ˜ƒ
22:48 <@Dune> fixed
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> great! hmm, it doesn't look that bad
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> and for web.. it would be quite easy to implement
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> #json
22:52 <@Dune> hehe :)
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I will wait for advanced techniques ðŸ˜®
22:53 <@Dune> you can spoil yourself in the grass_main.json :)
22:53 <@Dune> it hints for them ;)
22:53 <@Dune> what do you want to make; @Savander ?
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I think, I have some free time
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> maybe a week, I want to try make typescript tool
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> to create auto-maps, via web
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> at least, the basic stuff at beginning
22:54 <@Dune> :0
22:54 <@Dune> awesome
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Yea, my c/c++ skills are sh*t
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> compare to web. typescript/php/c#
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> C/C++ introduces memory management, pointers and that stuff
22:56 <@Dune> haha, it's a bit nasty
22:56 <@Dune> you can avoid it a bit in C++ sometimes
22:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> i understand them, but it's not easy to program in that language. Especially GUi's
22:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> smart pointers, auto keyword
22:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> but, web GUI's are super easy :D. Especially now.. ;D
22:56 <@Dune> that's nice :)
22:57 <@Dune> can't wait to see what you can make :D
22:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I will try, unless some client will come to me and ask for a service.. then it will be later ðŸ˜„
22:58 <@Dune> ok :D
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> your tutorial looks like quite good documentation so
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> you told me, where's the name, what's important
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> how to implement conditions
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> like, I just need to abstrac that
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> abstract*
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> that "random" thing, takes ID as a parameter?
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I mean, if 3 tiles, has the same random ID
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> it will take one of the tile?
23:01 <@Dune> no
23:01 <@Dune> "random": 150 means it has 1/150th chance
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> oh
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> with THAT conditions
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> great
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> so, i can make 1/200 for a detail
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> and base as a filler
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> okay, I have to draw a project first
23:06 <@Dune> :D
23:06 <@Dune> and of course, you can select other IDs as conditions
23:06 <@Dune> @Savander: little tricky thing, the automapper actually runs the rules twice
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> twice?
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I mean, but how it can broke things?
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> if it do twice the same
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> so it will output twice the same results, I guesS?
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Or i don't understand it correctly ?
23:15 <@Dune> wooo
23:16 <@Dune> we won a zomb game! on the fort
23:16 <@Dune> that's hard man
23:16 <@Dune> @Savander: more or less. you can set conditions relative to other automapped tiles
23:17 <@Dune> {"x": -1, "y":0, "value": 98},
23:17 <@Dune> so the second pass can change things a bit
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> oh...
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> now I understand
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> btw. order of conditions
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> mattesr?
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> matter/
23:19 <@Dune> yes
23:19 <@Dune> they are applied in order
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> order of sets, matter?
23:19 <@Dune> well order of conditions shouldn't matter, it's an AND
23:19 <@Dune> order of sets does
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> hmm, okay
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I have to think, about it
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Because, at first. I want to make basic version, where you can set common things
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> like, corners, on-tiles,
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> one-tiles*
23:20 <@Dune> yeah, that's a very good plan
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> filler, and randomers
23:20 <@Dune> you don't need to think about all that
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> And maybe later, make advanced editor, where you can apply your own conditions
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> maybe somehow visually
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> but, at first I will focus on basic stuff
23:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> so everyone could make, their own auto-mapper, at least on basic level.
23:28 <@Dune> very good :)
