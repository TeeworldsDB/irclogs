08:41 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> grrrrRRRRrRrRaaaaaaAAAAAA.  teeworlds, stop beinb broken.
08:42 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> teeworlds is my main stress relief ~ switch off ~ meditation ~ relaxation ~ de-sressy un-stressy undo-stressor non-stressor.  getting frazzley build up of stress without ability to just hop into a game anymore.
08:43 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> this ddos (if that what it is) is really hurting me, mannnnnnnn!
08:43 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> :p * > 9000
09:40 < rand> is this "attack" responsible of lag spike on servers ?
09:43 < rand> sometimes, I got the impression that  my packets are lost, while beeing optical my ISP is also a bit unstable tough
11:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't think so, it's masterservers
11:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Digit: you can't find games?
11:26 < rand> still there are "(connecting)" client on servers, it's not only masterservers
11:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah because servers don't upgrade to 0.65
11:27 < rand> because they receive spoof packets
11:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I removed those from the server browser client side, helps a bit :/
11:27 < rand> whatever the server version 
11:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> No 0.6.5 never has those
11:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> At least tell me if you see one
11:27 < rand> that's not it
11:28 < rand> server still receive packets
11:29 < rand> the false clients are just not kept as client on server and then are not reported in serverinfo
11:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Doesn't that fix it then?
11:30 < rand> dunno how a server receiving bunch of useless packets behaves
11:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It fixes the lack of player slots at least
21:55 < rand> I wonder if Oy would prefer something with 16 players max on clients with some extra information from server to define spectators
21:56 < rand> like totally separate slots
21:57 < rand> it would be a pain for modded server (and implies a bigger patch) but it looks closer to what ancient messages says
21:58 < Dune> hmm
21:58 < rand> that's why the PR is a proposal
21:58 < Dune> I think he wants extra spectators on clients
22:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> To separate players from spectators
22:11 < rand> that would be more scalable
