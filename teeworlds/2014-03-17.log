01:35 < Maimer> whats the record
01:35 <@matricks> world? dunno
01:35 <@matricks> thats mine
01:35 < Maimer> just write a script to get the best possible tile
01:35 <@matricks> the game "ends" when you get the 2048 peice, I were close as hell to getting a 4096
01:35 < Maimer> show the creator of that who is boss
01:35 <@matricks> Maimer: doesn't work like that
01:35 < Maimer> oh so you cant even go past 2048
01:36 < Maimer> who puts an artificial limit on something like this???
01:36 <@matricks> yes you can
01:36 <@matricks> just press keep playing
01:36 <@matricks> which is what I did
01:36 < Maimer> ah okay
01:36 < Maimer> I wonder what the theoretical max you could get is
01:37 <@matricks> easy to calculate
01:38 <@matricks> 4,8,16,32  64,128,256,512,  1024,2048,4096, etc etc
01:39 < Maimer> well for each value
01:39 < Maimer> you need a certain amount of tiles
01:39 < Maimer> in order to make a tile of that value
01:39 <@matricks> I mean if you fill the board, those are the tiles that you are going to have on the board
01:39 <@matricks> then it's game over
01:40 < Maimer> hmmm yea true

14:20 < Dune> hey guys
14:20 < Dune> quick question there
14:21 < Dune> do you think it's faster to learn to do makefile or LUA settings files for bam?
14:21 < EastByte> bam is much easier
14:21 < Dune> oh :D
14:21 <@matricks> I use makefiles on some occations actuall
14:21 <@matricks> for one liner builds more or less
14:22 < Dune> that's my "let's think about it for 2hours to save 15mins" moment of the day
14:22 < Dune> ok, great, thank you for the answers
14:25 <@minus> yeah, makefiles are definitely faster to pick up
14:26 <@minus> bam is a bit more complex
14:26 < EastByte> on small projects without subfolders
14:28 < EastByte> in bam you can collect all sourcefiles automaticly, link and compile in ~3 lines
14:28 <@minus> though the learning curve is a lot more steep
14:29 <@minus> makefiles? all: gcc…
14:29 < EastByte> it is?
14:29 < EastByte> I won't ever take a look into makefile docs anymore :/
14:30 < EastByte> you need to be insane to understand all that shit
14:31 <@minus> makefiles or bam
14:31 < EastByte> make
14:31 <@minus> it indeed is insane at times
14:31 <@minus> i haven't gotten there
14:31 <@minus> i've written a lot more bam
14:31  * minus points at 2yo pull request on github
15:22 < Dune> whoaa
15:23 < Dune> some of the parameters I want to send to the compiler are given by a shell command
15:23 < Dune> I tried to retrieve them with lua but it's super complex o.o
15:23 < Dune> I have to execute a command that writes in a file and then reads the file 
15:24 < Dune> damn lua
15:24 <@matricks> lol
15:24 <@matricks> you are doing it wrong
15:24 < Dune> that seems likely
15:24 <@matricks> you can use io.popen
15:24 < Dune> I tried that first
15:24 < Dune> it's not supported on my system
15:24 <@matricks> oh
15:24 < Dune> even though I have lua 5.1
15:25 <@matricks> and what do you need from an external app?
15:25 <@matricks> "This function is system dependent and is not available on all platforms."
15:25 < Dune> I just start the shell command and it gives me a list of parameters I send to g++
15:25 <@matricks> like pkg-config?
15:25 < Dune> yeah
15:26 <@matricks> settings.cc.flags:Add("`pkg-config --cflags sdl`") is what I usually do :)
15:26 < Dune> with ` ? oO
15:26 <@matricks> yeah, let the shell deal with it
15:26 < Dune> wow okay I'll try that
15:26 < Dune> thanks!
15:26 <@matricks> don't work under windows but.. all other platforms :)
15:27 < Dune> alright
15:27 <@matricks> echo hello `pkg-config --cflags sdl`
15:33 < Dune> awesome, it works!
15:59 < Dune> wow it looks so much nicer than make
15:59 <@matricks> hehe
15:59 < Dune> $^ -o $@ no more
16:02 <@matricks> Bless you
16:05 <@minus> that looks cancerous
16:05 < EastByte> :)
16:06 <@matricks> I thought he sneezed
17:13 < JulianAssange> Zveri #1
18:13 < Maimer> matricks: http://i.imgur.com/H1mxSM3.png

18:15 < Maimer> how can it not load
18:15 < Maimer> its imgur
18:18 <@matricks> well, it doesn't
18:19 < ghost91> it does for me :P
18:19 < Learath2> whoa Maimer 
18:19 < Maimer> I assume its an ISP thing matricks
18:19 <@matricks> what is it?
18:20 < Maimer> its a screenshot of the game 2048
18:20 < Maimer> with the 4096 tile
18:20 <@matricks> nice :)
18:20 <@matricks> almost got there yesterday
18:20 < Maimer> I was gonna fool you at first
18:20 < Maimer> but it wasnt my game
18:20 <@matricks> http://matricks.se/2048best.png
18:20 < Maimer> someone else got it
18:20 < Maimer> wow nice
18:20 < Maimer> yea thats super close
18:21 < Maimer> I have actually only played twice so far
18:21 < Maimer> how many games have oyu played?
18:21 <@matricks> about 8
18:22 <@matricks> give me another try I can make it :)
18:22 <@matricks> you get kinda boned by the 10% 4 spawn
18:23 < Maimer> yea I saw that in the game
18:23 < Maimer> and I didnt know if it was intended
18:23 < Maimer> or if it was a bug
18:23 <@matricks> it's intended, otherwise is gets really simple
18:24 <@matricks> this is sooo fun: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HncXiIwp8SM
18:24 < Nimda3> [YouTube] Title: Horrible Swedish Candy | Rating: 4.01/5.00 | Views: 33,346
18:28 < Maimer> do you eat those candies matricks?
18:28 <@matricks> yeah
18:28 <@matricks> the first two are swedish classics
18:28 < Maimer> what is the second one?
18:28 < Maimer> the hard candy one
18:29 < Maimer> is it like a pepper or something
18:29 <@matricks> naa, it's a salt licorish blend in the middle
18:29 < Maimer> I think thats the 3rd one
18:29 < Maimer> unless there is another salted licorish one
18:30 <@matricks> first one is licorish covered with salt
18:30 < Maimer> I am talking about the Tyrkisk Peber
18:30 <@matricks> yeah, that has a salty center
18:30 < Maimer> so people actually enjoy these things
18:30 <@matricks> hell yeah
18:31 <@matricks> salty licorish is a swedish/finnish thing... and parts of netherlands have them as well
18:31 < Maimer> it sounds not pleasant
18:31 < BotoX> despite it's name, this tastes pretty awesome http://www.kroatische-feinkost.de/images/product_images/popup_images/188_0.png
