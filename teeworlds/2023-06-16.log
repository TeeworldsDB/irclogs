19:34 < ChillerDragon> minus: u know if oy@teeworlds.com actually reaches oy?
19:34 < minus> it's an email account, dunno if he checks it, ChillerDragon
19:35 < bridge> <d_une> dunno either
19:35 < minus> if i had to guess i'd say no
19:35 < bridge> <d_une> yeah, he doesn't go through all of his github notifications either
19:36 < ChillerDragon> rip
19:36 < ChillerDragon> minus top10 reachable irc users
19:38 < ChillerDragon> do you get notifications or something like that? on how many irc channels are you? leak your setup minus how u respond so fast in a ded channel in a ded chat protocol for a ded game you are hanging in since over a decade?
19:39 < minus> irc open on separate monitors pretty much all the time; channel name gets a bright green background when i get highlighted
19:40 < ChillerDragon> but why irc open
19:40 < ChillerDragon> for which chats?
19:41 < minus> for #teeworlds ofc
19:42 < ChillerDragon> woah there is barley any activity here
19:42 < minus> and #sr.ht and a couple unnamed shitposting channels of course

19:43 < ChillerDragon> minus you should be helping oy to merge some prs
19:43 < ChillerDragon> #minus4president

19:43 < ChillerDragon> yea irc is nice
19:44 < ChillerDragon> but still impressive to have a inactive chat open at all times
