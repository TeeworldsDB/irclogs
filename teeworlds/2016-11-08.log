17:11 < CaptainAMN> hello guys, anyone here using Linux Mint 18 ?
17:12 < Henningstone> Coincidently yes :)
17:12 <@minus> Coincidently no
17:12 < Obani> same
17:15 < CaptainAMN> Does anyone mind me asking a few qs? I have used Mint for 2 years on my old machine. Now i upgraded my hardware, and on bootup there is only a about a 30% chance of it properly booting up. I created bootable flash drive to freshly install on my new SSD. I think just the "grub" loads (the screen which asks you to select recovery mode, normal bootup etc). It won't even boot from the USB stick! Please help. I haven't played t
17:16 < CaptainAMN> this link exactly describes the problem. I don't understand how to add the parameter and how to save it like that, once the OS is permanently installed
17:16 < CaptainAMN> https://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/842
17:20 < Henningstone> The article clearly explains what and how to do, so where exactly is your problem?
17:21 < CaptainAMN> i dont know how to add the parameter. what do i have to type?
17:24 < Henningstone> 1. Reboot and wait to see the initial boot screen of GRUB (that you mentioned above). 
17:24 < Henningstone> 2. Select your choice (pe. LInux Mint) with the cursor and then press the [tab] key to get the full boot grub commad line. Avoid modifying it.
17:24 < Henningstone> 3. Go to the line starting with the word linux and ending with the words: quiet splash
17:24 < Henningstone> 4. Add '<graphics driver>.modeset=0' parameter
17:24 < CaptainAMN> it does clearly explain it, just technically, i don't understand where do i have to write radeon.modeset=0 after the command line shows up. hope thats not confusing
17:24 < CaptainAMN> thanks, there is actually only that one line
17:25 < Henningstone> I think that are pretty clear instructions the article gives there :P
17:25 < Henningstone> Good luck!
17:25 < CaptainAMN> thank you, i will try to write that just after the line
17:25 <@minus> use windows :D
17:25 < CaptainAMN> haha, you're right. i love mint though
17:26 <@minus> or just don't use grub
17:28 < CaptainAMN> it's booting from the stick and supposed to install to a new ssd. I just get a black screen, it's hard to troubleshoot it. Mint is meant for noobs, i dont want these erros
17:28 < CaptainAMN> thanks anyways guys! much appreciated
17:28 < Henningstone> could you manage to add the line to the boot command?
17:29 <@minus> make sure it does NOT use /dev/sdX as boot disk but a UUID so you don't accidently try to boot from an empty disk
17:30 < CaptainAMN> i am writing from the this exact computer, i would have to restart now but i guess i will just install windows. lost a whole day researching this. Thanks minus, all other drives are disconnected. there is only the SSD and The stick
17:32 < CaptainAMN> it's a problem between video card and monitor, because the card supports up to 4K res and the monitor is 1680*1050, i'll install Mint when they fix this or release a new mintnoobz
17:38 < CaptainAMN> bb
