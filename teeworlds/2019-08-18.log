00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @JesseH:
08:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I finished deploying to windows32 and 64 yesterday ^.^
09:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I love it ‚ù§ great job @heinrich5991 for adding CI/CD
09:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> What do you mean?
10:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> continues integration/development
10:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut stuff thats automatically checks if the build fails for example
10:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Thats not what I asked for
10:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I asked for the win32/64 thin
10:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> g
11:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @ChillerDragon continous integration/deployment
11:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> stuff that automatically checks if the build fails AND automatically deploys the result (if success)
11:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> for example automatic releases on GitHub for windows when you push on the master
11:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lol Assa? xd
11:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what? üòÑ
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> why do you explain to me what i already explained and nobody asked for üòÑ (no offense just lul)
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh wait fokko was asking for the win stuff thats probably related to the cd part
12:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd
13:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no, you said something wrong thats why he said it correct
13:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nobo dragon
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i wouldnt consider explaining half of the thing as false information and rather as incomplete. Thats what i also marked with "for example" that i covered a example of the whole ci/cd.
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> (sorri for this useless respond but i really wanted to say that :D)

15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> this comes up when I try to build teeworlds using cmake gui on Windowxs
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> this comes up when I try to build teeworlds using cmake gui on Windows
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ok somehow did it now
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nvm
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ```
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> warning: comparison is always true due to limited range of data type [-Wtype-limits]
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> m_pTiles[Index].m_Index <= NUM_INDICES-1
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ```
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Makes no sense, `NUM_INDICES` is defined as 256, so it checks for <= 255, which should work for an unsigned char
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Help :D
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I cannot use `std::stof`, does someone know how I get it to work? Cant compile it on 0.7
16:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Btw, I have stored `NUM_INDICES-1` in another value now and that works as a workaround..., but I need std::stof, but cant get it
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Use functions from the baselib in teeworlds for string manipulation
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Which one can convert strings to floats?
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> lol got it
16:35 < rand> > warning: comparison is always true due to limited range of data type [-Wtype-limits]
16:35 < rand> the message is explicit, the condition is always true
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I know, but it shouldnt say that message
16:36 < rand> then, the test is probably useless
16:36 < rand> it is a warning
16:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> the warning doesnt appear in 0.6, but nvm. I made a new variable int Value = NUM_INDICES-1, which I use at this position. The warning does appear anymore
16:37 < rand> this kind of comparison may occur because of some error in the source code
16:38 < rand> the compiler raises it as a warning so you can check about it
16:39 < rand> NUM_INDICES might be lower in 0.6, or -Wtype-limits was used, or m_Index was not an unsigned char
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> No, it was the same
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> NUM_INDICES is from me
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> And the warning was on, and m_Index was an unsinged char aswell
16:40 < rand> I think you can ignore it unless NUM_INDICES get higher than 256
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it wont
17:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> If I use "Hide bots" in the browser, bots from my server are still shown. Ive applied the PLAYERFLAG_BOT to them, and ingame they also have the bot skin. Whats wrong
17:58 < Oy> u set the bot flag in the server info?
17:58 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1154
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thanks.
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oy, why dont we have the (%d) system for names again? Also for double names
19:30 < Oy> it's too much a hassle to clearly seperate similar ones
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> there is an official databse for similar characters
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> afaik DDNet uses that too
19:58 < Oy> but it's not just about similar characters, names can still be similar none the less
19:58 < Oy> best option is to enable id's
19:59 < Oy> Dune: what about this one https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2152 ?
20:16 <@Dune> Oy: imho adding skins is not trivial at all and we shouldn't randomly add one skin in a minor release 
20:17 <@Dune> Maybe it is okay to add skins in a minor release, but then it's gotta be a big update to be worthwhile the trouble
20:17 < Oy> but if we do it with a major update it will take a long while
20:18 <@Dune> Imho the one thing that distinguishes standard skins over custom skins is that standard skins can be seen by everyone 
20:18 < Oy> since we want to wait with the major ones
20:18 <@Dune> Yes that is true
20:18 < Oy> so we don'T scare of mod creators
20:18 < Oy> but players are supposed to update their clients, then they would see the skins
20:19 < Oy> most of them
20:19 <@Dune> There are some changes we can't squeeze because of that yeah
20:19 <@Dune> Hmm, well the way I see it is that minor releases should be optional but I may be mistaken on that
20:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix @heinrich5991
20:20 < Oy> in the past we often had security issues, where people should update
20:20 <@Dune> At least I would like to see a bigger update if it does happen, to justify the trouble :/
20:20 <@Dune> Yeah true
20:21 < Oy> but if it's just a cosmetic one than there's no urge to do it yeah
20:21 <@Dune> And we do have the version srv
20:22 < Oy> new version would have the ingame browser, maybe that helps people to update
20:23 <@Dune> We have some time before 0.7.4 anyway... not that much changed since last release 
20:23 <@Dune> Yeah gotta decide what to do
20:23 < Oy> already 129 commits since last release :P
20:23 <@Dune> I would like to get the editor in but @LordSk is very busy 
20:24 <@Dune> And gotta design the quads system
20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Merge the skin, Oy
20:25 < Oy> yeah, that editor would be nice
20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Which editor? o.o
20:25 < Oy> secret new one :P
20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> shut up :OOOOOOOO
20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Any teasers? :p
20:27 <@Dune> @Sonix did a lot of fantastic skins
20:30 <@Dune> LordSk says hi
20:31 < Oy> hi o/
20:37 < Oy> LordSk already did most of the new editor
20:37 < Oy> rest should be doable
20:37 < Oy> ok to post the teaser video here?
20:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah np Oy
20:41 < Oy> fokkonaut https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCs3a3Uz8cw
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Looks good, but why would you place the layers on the right?
20:45 < Oy> Sonix asked the same thing :D
20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Left is better
20:51 <@Dune> Why does photoshop have it on the right then :p
20:54 < Oy> inkscape too
20:54 < Oy> probably a matter of personal taste
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> editor looks awesome.
21:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> set left: false
21:13 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2193
21:16 <@Dune> Cool. :) 
21:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how many skins are we planning to add?
22:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> pro tip: add heart markings: one big heart and maybe 3 smaller ones - young girls like hearts
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Now that we have such a nice skin system we need more skins and decorations, yes.
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oy, are you there?
22:31 < Oy> kinda
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Cool, this is the right way or am I retarded?
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/teeworlds/commit/f1cb05b6ad427eb144767ae72e407f97ecb99e88
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> And there is really no way to assign the info to the own tee? :
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> :D*
22:34 < Oy> no, not possible
22:36 < Oy> looks correct
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Cool
22:39 < Oy> https://github.com/fokkonaut/teeworlds/commit/f1cb05b6ad427eb144767ae72e407f97ecb99e88#diff-7be5f6a31ba927b77856236df2b1b09bR276 max_clan_length
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I mean why got this possibility removed?
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Good one, thanks!
22:41 < Oy> what possibility?
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> change name
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Btw, can you try to build the repo on Windows with MinGW? I get weird undefined references, have a possible fix but only can test it tomorrow.
22:49 <@Dune> Yes you can 
22:49 <@Dune> But mingw is messy and difficult 
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> With VS and on Linux it works
22:51 <@Dune> Yes
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I dont know what caused it, but it wont link due to that
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I will try the possibls fix tomorrow, hoping it works
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune Are you on Windows?
22:56 <@Dune> Sometimes
22:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> If yes, can you check whether this happens with unmodified Teeworlds too?
22:57 <@Dune> No and I don't use mingw anyway
22:57 <@Dune> Because configuration is difficult 
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Okay, will just try that tomorrow
22:59 < Oy> builds with mingw without a problem
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Are you sure you checked out to the right branch?
23:00 < Oy> just built master
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> need to build F-DDrace
23:01 <@Dune> Oh you are on mingw?
23:01 < Oy> have both vs and mingw
23:02 <@Dune> Wouldn't it be better to build teeworlds with mingw to avoid msvc redistributable dependencies
23:02 <@Dune> Or is it built in some lib
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oy, can you also check the branch?
23:02 < Oy> yeah, it's the freetype lib
23:03 < Oy> took the executable provided by the freetype guys
23:03 < Oy> have to build it ourself somehow
23:03 < Oy> fokkonaut what branch?
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> did you build my repo or tw master?
23:04 < Oy> tw master
23:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oh, okay. Could you try to build my repo (branch)?
23:14 < Oy> works
23:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> writing deployment files feels like writing css
23:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well it's scripting
23:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oy, did you check out to F-DDrace?
23:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune if I add an PR for an automated test-build, would you prefer to do them with tags or on every change in the master?
23:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> And should a new release be added or the "test" release be overwritten every time?
23:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Assa Should probably be for every release, and overwrite the previous
23:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so for every commit - overwriting - okay ^.^
23:43 < Oy> fokkonaut yeah
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Lol, then I have absolutely no clue what happened for me
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Thanks
