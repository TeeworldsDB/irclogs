00:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i think hvlip and vflip is bugged
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i keep confusing up down left right horizontal vertical ... this is madness
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> y-1 = top
00:12 < Dune> doubt its bugged
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> look at the images
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and explain me
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> flipping is not rotating
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> no matter how you flip tile 157, it won't go up!
00:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye ik
00:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ive been autmapping the last 2 days ima get the basics slowly xd
00:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you can klick the link above for some motivation
00:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> which
00:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> > https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2174
00:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Assa
00:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah ye
03:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/68e4a1784bd4f7021634f0cf4198f6e14b711495/src/engine/shared/compression.cpp#L55
03:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what's the purpose of that loop.
03:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that does not loop
03:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ah, I see
03:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the goto equivalent
03:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *high level rubber duckying*
05:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> find this kinda not so pretty, as it makes kind of not much sense to use a class if there is no internal state saved at all. https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/shared/compression.h. might as well save the pointer that is being returned internally and return it when asked via another method. usual use case if ptr = varInt.Unpack(ptr, &integer)
05:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think it would look better if the pointer was not used at all here. the VariableInt could be constructed by passing the pointer and the pointer could be returned via a method resulting in an interface that looks like this: integer = varInt.Unpack()
05:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> when one is done with unpacking, one might retrieve the pointer via some method like GetPtr() or GetPos()
05:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as it's c++, the construction might get a size attribute as well in order not to enter unexplored territory üòÑ
09:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> _rubber ducking?_ http://www.developerduck.com/
09:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you can click it üòâ
12:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the last part is not
12:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> -y :'(?
13:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> posting in chat rooms is best rubber ducking i agree @jxsl13
13:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lol the while(0) loop im not sure if that is supirior to goto xxD
13:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there is some crazy stuff going one üòÆ
13:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> for example this here: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/68e4a1784bd4f7021634f0cf4198f6e14b711495/src/engine/shared/compression.cpp#L23
13:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> one could write instead```
13:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if (i != 0)
13:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13>   *pDst |= 1<<7; // set extend bit (may branch)
13:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> else
13:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13>   break;
13:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ```
13:52 < Dune> how prevalent are dynamic IPs, and how often do they typically change?
13:53 < Dune> I used to have dynamic IPs in France but they would only change every router reboot or so
13:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> in germany they change about every day at 3am
13:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and on router restart/resynchronization
13:55 < Dune> so we would have to introduce another single point of failure
13:55 < Dune> at least it's not critical to playing the game I guess
13:58 < Dune> I think some games use XMPP
13:58 < Dune> yeah LoL uses XMPP for exactly that purpose: chat & game invites: https://xmpp.org/uses/gaming.html
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> effort vs. players that will use it.
13:59 < Dune> a global friend/chat system would be very much used I believe
14:00 < Dune> it's a fairly recurrent request
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i hope its save to unload not loaded or invalid textures
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> http://zillyhuhn.com:8080/XN
14:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea looks like in all the use cases
14:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nullpointer check :o?
14:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> of passed parameter ._. or does nobody do that?
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea thats what i am wondering
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I would suggest caddy a a reverse proxy in order to have ssl for your websites
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im afraight i pass a nullpointer
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it grabs let's encrypt certificates automatically
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> üòÆ
14:46 < Dune> @redix do you know what would happen with https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2430 go alright with 0.7.4 client and 0.7.5 server and vice versa?
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> 0.7.5 client + 0.7.4 server -> it will always display personal record
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> 0.7.5 server + 0.7.4 client -> server must not send RECORDTYPE_MAP
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> in 0.7.4 it was meant to be the personal record üòÑ
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 0.5.5 server + 0.7.5 client üòÆ
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 0.7.5*
14:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> server can tell the client which type of record it was :)
14:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> none at all, personal record or player record
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> or map record*
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I was reading some issues from 2011 saying that race will be part of vanilla anyway.
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> a better solution would be to add another bool... but then 0.7.5 clients would drop 0.7.4 packets -.-
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> fast forward, 2020, race is not really part of vanilla yet xD
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> the protocol is not really extensible
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> rip godfather Sushi Tee
14:56 < Oy> @redix how about another colour for map records for info message?
14:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yeah would be good. what color? üòÑ
14:57 < Oy> gold? :D
14:57 < Oy> probably hard to read
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> pink, everyone loves pink

15:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> ? üòÑ
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> i guess gold and pink are too bright =\
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or just white
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> a simple finish is white
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> personal record blue
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> red?
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that color in the screenshot is purple
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> üòÆ
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I find that too dark, might be a lighter purple
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> red is already used for the difference
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> got a hex value of that purple, @redix ?
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> already got it ._.

15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> looks good
15:27 < Oy> yeah, looks good
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> updated the PR üëç
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> what about making the network protocol more extensible/less strict?
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> e.g. using default values for missing fields... so we can extend net messages. might be useful for the vote thing
15:36 < Oy> like we could add values to netmessages without old clients dropping it?
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> and ignoring unknown flags instead of dropping the whole packet
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> old clients would just ignore the additional fields. but new ones would drop the old messages because of missing fields
15:37 < Oy> ah, yeah sounds good
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> and for enums: use some default value when the value is unknown
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> integers and strings should be fine
15:40 < Oy> another thing that would be useful, if u could send just a diff for netmessages
15:43 < Dune> btw https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=123964#p123964
15:43 < Dune> I have mint cinnamon and cannot reproduce
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> if i go crazy with automapper rules and make them super complex would that still be megered if it solves a few edge cases?
15:44 < Dune> imo that is fine, as long as the edge cases are isolated in a part of the file
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i tried that
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i wasnt able to isolate or comment in the json properly
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it caused some undefined behaviour i think
15:46 < Oy> Dune: some displaymanager thing?
15:47 < Dune> not so sure about that, it could be irrelevant to our flavor
15:47 < Dune> how comes it works with sudo 
15:47 < Dune> flatpak also works
15:51 < Oy> https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/108784/running-gui-application-as-another-non-root-user
15:51 < Dune> ho
15:52 < Dune> so $DISPLAY is probably ""
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh btw does someone know how to properly activate live automapper? I always have to click around 5 times before i get it running xd
15:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i guess its not possible in under 3 clicks
16:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> godfather, the second, a.k.a LordSk was working on an awesome editor update :'/ gotta wait for next christmas I guess.
16:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *excitement overflow*
16:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i dont like changes :/
16:14 < Dune> @ChillerDragon has Teeworlds actually hard-changed anything since 0.7?
16:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wdym by hard changes?
16:15 < Dune> not optional
16:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh hmm
16:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not that i know why?
16:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> If there's one software that you can't complaining about changing, it's Teeworlds :p
16:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxD
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i need one digit to destory ur statement
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 7
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ima make this a meme xd
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> teeworlds actually changed that much that i quit playing the game lol
16:20 < Dune> > since 0.7
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes ik
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but your statement was general wasnt it
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> > If there's one software that you can't complaining about changing, it's Teeworlds :p
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> well... what changed? basic gameplay didn't change within the last 10 years :D
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> with 0.7 we have a new menu. there are several details that changed but there havent been any major changes
16:25 < Dune> yeah, since matricks left I think we only had the ninja change?
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well the major change is its incompatiblity
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also i am not able to correctly aim in 0.7
16:25 < Dune> https://i.imgur.com/GSjMw4v.png
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> might be a ddnet to vanilla difference not sure
16:25 < Dune> oy: version server still at 0.7.3
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> today most games break compatibility every few weeks üòÑ
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> you have some time to update... then you might get some problems
16:26 < Dune> yeah, sometimes you can't watch month old replays :p
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but big parts of the 0.6 community are used to some ddnet standards so 0.7 can be seen as a heavy downgrade for some
16:28 < Oy> Dune: that's the 0.6 version server, forgot to update that
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> version server works for me locally
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> is the server maybe having some connection issues? =\
16:29 < Oy> works for me too locally
16:29 < Dune> you mean 0.7? @redix
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yes
16:29 < Oy> heinrich5991: said he can see incoming data, but nothing is send out
16:30 < Oy> have to update this for the 0.6 version server https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/0.6/src/versionsrv/versionsrv.cpp#L65
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I that hash mismatch warning I get on zCatch due to the version server or due to me merging 0.7.4 incorrectly?
16:32 < Oy> what's the message?
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> on server startup
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Wasning net hash versionmismatch or something like that
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Warning
16:33 < Oy> update https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/scripts/cmd5.py#L33  with ur hash, then the warning goes away
16:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> WARNING: netversion hash differs
16:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ah ok, thanks
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @ChillerDragon just for curiosity... what are the major things that 0.7 is missing compared to ddnet?
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> obviously is does not have all the ddrace specific stuff...
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> antiping
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> i used ddnet myself but i hardly used any non vanilla features üòÑ
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @redix well i can speak best for me and i try to find out every day why others do not update but i guess not updating is also a coninience and bubble thing
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> all I want is to disable the hud completely and read chat in f1 console
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> For me personally as i already said i can not properly control my mouse in 0.7 idk if ddnet had a influence on that. Also I really depend on demo features like demo cutting and sort by date or name. @redix
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> well in tw some people even refuse to update because they dont like some colors or such stuff üòÑ
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Does anyone know how I'd find out the include dependency tree on windows without using windows?
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> other people heavily depend on antiping or the sdl1 version to have a playable teeworlds expiriene @redix
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> like one of my classes includes stuff on windows which kills my windows build seemingly
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> things like colors and hud can easily be fixed in custom clients
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yeah the demo stuff could use some improvements
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also some really like to change their names ingame
16:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the new name system is really odd
16:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> when sdl1 works better than sdl2 your system is probably broken/outdated as fuck üòÑ
16:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> that might be true but unless you buy them new hardware the problem probably wont go away
16:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also ddnet did a lot with rendering and opengl magic where i have no clue of but seems like some players really profit from that
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> the opengl 3 backend is actually even slower then the 1.1 one =\
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> at least in some situations
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> than*
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and those were only the things that quickly came to my mind and are non ddrace. But you have to keep in mind that a big part of the player base plays a lot of ddrace and needs the clientside predicition and map editor features etc
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> well okay =\
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> any it only takes one reason to not update
16:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> if i wouldnt care i would have never updated because of the slightly off mousesense and played 0.6 until im the last one there
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> everytime i advertise 0.7 ingame people ask me "whats new" like "why should i do it" and  "what changed". I really lack arguments in these situations. Should i say its a new protocol so ddnet client wont work anymore and this removes antiping and name changing... but you get a new menu (which some people actually dislike).
16:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> you can not advertise a new vanilla gametype to the average ddrace player or fixed anti spoof for people who are save from spooing with ddnet client already.
16:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> sounds legit
16:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i think if the 0.7 name system gets fixed (reset to 0.6 state) with a lot of effort we could migrate the community to the new version and restore all the old standards
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> i dont get why changing the name is so important... changing skin makes sense. especially because some mods rely on it
16:57 < Dune> I like that you can identify people by their name
16:57 < Dune> I think no one would ask for that feature if it wasn't in teeworlds at some point
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes thats why (1) prefixes make so much sense Dune
16:58 < Dune> I agree
16:58 < Dune> But changing name is not great
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yeah unique names should come back
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the 0.7 has undistinguishable names which is annoying in whispering spectating and chatting not to mention modifications where playernames are arguemnts to commands
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well i personally do not care about changing names but seems like others do and thus 0.7 looks like a downgrade. I havent seen a single person saying yay finally i cant change my name anymore.
17:00 < Dune> well you can't always please everyone
17:00 < Dune> if you do, you will never manage to change anything
17:00 < Dune> there is still an option to remove double jump indicators because some people disliked that back then iirc
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> an option yes
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but removing a feature optionless is something else
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what about a server side config
17:01 < Dune> there are benefits to make name changing not an option
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sure options are not too great
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> whisper is broken as hell in combination with undistinguishable nicks
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> whisper is broken as hell period
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> bringing it back would be problematic... it would not work for old clients, so one player would have different names for the other players
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> thats a issue
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._. installing visual studio 2019 in a vm üòÑ that will be fun
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @fokkonaut did you already add the chat commands auto completion to your mod?, mind pointing me to the code :o?
17:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea i did
17:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> gamecontroller.cpp, at the bottom
17:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok, thanks
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> found?
17:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah, but not the position where you actually add your commands, as that currently seems to be the stuff from vanilla, that I also added
17:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> "add your commands"?
17:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what do you mean
17:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> So, I didnt understand in general what exactly you are looking for
17:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I wanna send the commands to the clients
17:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> where do you personalized commands, was my question
17:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that are use din your mod
17:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thats in OnPlayerConnect, in gamecontroller
17:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I send the commands there
17:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> to the client
17:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ah, ok
17:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Well, thats vanilla
17:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but the removal of client commands there is from me
17:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or do you mean, where the code for my commands is?
17:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> like after they got executed
17:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, took too long to realize that I'm on the vanilla branch.
17:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
17:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xdddd
17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> üòÆ I found a typo
17:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> harsh open source life you live there
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea fokko is big troll for not making it the default branch
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> üòÑ who wants the sweet code, gotta look for it.
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> std::function<void(class CPlayer *pPlayer, const char *pArgs)> > function pointers ._.
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Ryozuki did a great job so that it's easy to switch between both of them.
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> how does one install freetype and sdl on windows?
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ddnet libs
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> clone with the cmd given in my repo
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in the readme
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm illiterate when it comes to using windows other than for playing games...
19:43 < Dune> Oy: btw do you think of a way a vanilla server could signal client-sided bots? right now it is not possible without a code modification, which is forbidden
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> give clients the ability to signal that they are bots x)
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, ddnet had added some client flags to messages which were used by cheat clients as well to signal that they are such clients
20:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> also ddnet used that to signal that somone used the client
20:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> someone*
20:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I feel like one has to start developing on windows if it is pupposed to run on windows, as other OS don't care that much...
20:50 < Dune> @redix do you know a terrible server i could test my stability indicator on
20:51 < Dune> alternatively, does anyone have a terrible wifi connection that could host a home server on
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is teeworlds ever gonna be put in a proper namespace?
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (unique)
20:58 < Dune> adapt to the codebase, don't wait for the other way around
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> windows suck üò¶
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hard
21:11 < Dune> with lag: https://streamable.com/2y9jx
21:11 < Dune> without lag: https://streamable.com/z0fc3
21:11 < Dune> the number above is a badness score
21:11 < Dune> (that's just for debugging)
21:13 < Dune> it uses the prediction graph
21:13 < Dune> yellow spikes = +10 badness, red spikes = +50 badness
21:14 < Dune> it should be a reliable indicator of stability. I got 5 bars on a 250ping server
21:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> can you push the netgraph?
21:30 < Dune> push?
21:30 < Dune> @Assa
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> add a netrgraph to game, some options for network monitoring
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> like you have in the video
21:31 < Dune> those are in the game
21:31 < Dune> ctrl shift d g
21:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> üòÆ
21:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> lul
21:34 < Dune> ctrl shift q for more secret modes
21:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> ctrl shift q is my favorite mode
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I wonder how heavy the tcp impact due to a 24/7 econ connection is Oo
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> on the main thread
22:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> impact on what?
22:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i have 2 econ connections running on the same vps to localhost since months
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I mean on the tick delay
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> having kinda weird lags
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> did not notice anything
22:46 < Oy> Dune: we could add a setting for the clients so they could tell the server they're a bot and then the server can propagate it
23:03 < Dune> hm, is that abusable?
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well some trolls or nobrains will run around with it 24/7 and thus the filter for actual players is broken
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i suggest that this setting is not possible in vanilla client but the vanilla server expects it. So the client has to be actually edited.
23:07 < Dune> oh yeah it shouldn't be an option by default
23:07 < Dune> I mean, on the vanilla client
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
23:08 < Dune> but it would be difficult to enforce 
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what do you mean?
23:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what about more than is bot or not. What about a int with flags what type of client it is. Like chatbot/aimbot/spider and the admin can see these flags in ``status`` but the vanilla client can not set any of these flags without modifying the source code.
23:14 < Oy> and when u use it u get the bot skin ingame
23:16 < Oy> would be a flag the client sends on connect and a custom client has to modify the code to set it
23:33 < rand> and enforce human only player on vanilla game modes
23:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> would be stupid to allow everyone to set that via f1 or GUI :0
23:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as they would play around with it
23:37 < Dune> rand, shouldn't vanilla allow bots?
23:39 < Oy> then they might join without setting the flag
