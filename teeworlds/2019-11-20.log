14:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yo bois who invented or created the first fng mod? was it fstd?
14:27 < bridge_> [freenode] <fstd> ChillerDragon: no
14:27 < bridge_> [freenode] <fstd> ChillerDragon: i just wrote the 0.6 version because 0.5 was closed source and abandoned and stuff
14:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> do you know who created the 0.5 version?
14:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yo, I tried to increase the buffer, so that every player can have rainbow at the same time. It worked better than with the smaller buffer, but also this one got overloaded at some point. Is there no way to fix rainbow? :/
14:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @fokkonaut i guess not without custom client
14:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> on a custom client you could simply send rainbow on/off and StartTick
14:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea
14:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or i make the buffer insanely big xd
14:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> doesn't the client have some kind of protection, too?
14:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no
14:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well
14:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i think it has, but the server one is which gets overloaded
14:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> becuase it needs to send every tick a skin update to every client

14:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Can we update some copyright dates? Or will they stay like this due to matricks inactivity? :/
14:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> shht
14:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> .-.
14:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> dont steal the trademark @Assa :c
14:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> don't look at the date here
14:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/license.txt
14:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea ikr its outdated in a few places but 2015 is kinda old
14:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> guess teeworlds is public domain now
14:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> so nothing changed
16:54 < bridge_> [freenode] <fstd> ChillerDragon: my readme says "apparently written by some "TOM"."
17:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ok nice ill take that ðŸ™‚
18:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> meh is there a reason the shadow parts from grass_main in 0.7 got removed? It would be 100% backwards compatible otherwise :/
18:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its not even compatible with generic_shadows since it has a different offset. Meh makes updating maps annoying :C
18:55 < redix> My map-update tool can fix these things
18:55 < redix> Never really did a release but dune created some binaries
18:56 < redix> https://github.com/axblk/teeworlds/issues/34
18:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh thats cool
18:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how does it work?
18:57 < redix> But it does not support any non-vanilla layers (ddnet teleport, ...)
18:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea thats what i was afraight of
18:58 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i can port fng maps etc by hand but all those big ddrace maps thats the problem
19:00 < Dune> @ChillerDragon it does support 0.7 race-style teleports tho
19:00 < redix> It's a command line tool. Put it into the teeworlds folder. Call it with the path to the map as parameter
19:00 < Dune> the output is in %appdata% though
19:02 < redix> Maybe I'll find some time to improve this tool around christmas ^^
19:02 < Dune> I should get some time 'round christmas too like last year :)
19:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon just use the pr that deen had open for some weeks
19:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> which one? in what repo i did not notice any
19:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh you mean deens tool and the pr in ddnet/ddnet? Yea wasnt that just embedding everything. Thats not what i want. I could also embed the few maps my self i do not want to embed standard tiles and rather update to the new look. Would be sad if all 0.7 maps are bigger in size just because all standard tiles are embedded
19:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
