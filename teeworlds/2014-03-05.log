18:23 < JulianAssange> hopefully it's good
18:23 <@minus> i ordered a C++ language book a few days ago
18:24 < Progers> How did u know that i am russian? :D
18:24 <@minus> *badum tss*
18:24 < Progers> I ordered qt book a few days ago
18:24 <@minus> you've been here before!
18:24 < JulianAssange> funy minus
18:24 < JulianAssange> i didn't know Progers :D
18:24 < Progers> Ok
18:25 < JulianAssange> think i'll go back to sleep
18:25 <@minus> I know Qt!
18:25 < Progers> Qt with russian translation :D
18:25 <@minus> it's… not very nice
18:25 < JulianAssange> isn't Qt that crappy language for window-ed programs in linux
18:25 < JulianAssange> like C#?
18:25 <@minus> Qt is a C++ framwork
18:25 < Progers> qt 4.8 by maks shlee
18:25 <@minus> 4.8? pff
18:25 <@minus> 5.2!
18:26 < Progers> First must learn 4.8
18:26 < JulianAssange> yeah it's the same as c#
18:26 <@minus> no it's not
18:26 < Progers> qt? 
18:26 < JulianAssange> ya
18:26 < Progers> No
18:26 < JulianAssange> sry not c#
18:26 < JulianAssange> uh
18:26 <@minus> you can't compare a framework to a language
18:26 < JulianAssange> vb.net
18:26 < Progers> -_-
18:26 <@matricks> :)
18:27 < Progers> OOk
18:27 < Progers> Good trolling
18:27 < JulianAssange> im serious lol
18:27 <@minus> anyway, not much of a fan of Qt. not using it for GUI applications though
18:27 < JulianAssange> don't you make GUI's in vb.net 
18:27 < JulianAssange> i've never used it
18:27 < Progers> JulianAssange: What Os do u use?
18:27 < JulianAssange> gnu linux
18:28 < Progers> distro
18:28 <@minus> Progers: still on gentoo?
18:28 < JulianAssange> ubuntu & gentoo
18:28 <@matricks> minus: doing gui apps are.. well.. iffy :((( hard todo crossplatform
18:28 <@minus> yeah
18:29 <@minus> Gtk is crossplatform too!
18:29 < Progers> minus: Uh no, i had some problems on gentoo, then i installed opensuse then arch then DBSD then freebsd then feodora then debian then windows 8.1(pffff) then windows 7 D: AND now i am on Kubuntu
18:30 <@minus> the epic journey of Progers
18:30 < JulianAssange> >windows 8.1
18:30 < JulianAssange> lole
18:30 < Progers> Its bad
18:30 < Progers> I have uefi bios D:
18:30 < JulianAssange> you can change that surely..
18:30 < JulianAssange> i can change mine
18:31 < Progers> This metro style is verybad for me
18:31 < Progers> Win7 is a lot better than Win8
18:31 < JulianAssange> ^
18:31 < JulianAssange> windows xp superior race
18:31 < Progers> Ok ok Gnu/Linux is better that Win
18:31 < JulianAssange> well, when it comes to windows..
18:32 < Progers> This KDE 4.11.5 is very stable
18:32 < Progers> No lags, no bugs
18:32 <@matricks> windows isn't a freaking os.. it's a toy
18:33 <@matricks> roar!
18:33 <@minus> not as much as arch or gentoo
18:33 < JulianAssange> indeed
18:34 < Progers> I hate spyware software
18:34 <@matricks> stupid statement, everyone does
18:34 <@matricks> no one loves cancer
18:34 <@minus> i like botnets
18:34 < Progers> Looking for something to change Skype
18:35 < Progers> Found jitsi
18:37 < Progers> Lets compile this new sources and see what you have added there
18:41 < JulianAssange> the problem w/ that is, noone else uses it
18:43 < Progers> Uh great errors
19:03 < Edible> minus, is it really cross platform? because afaik everything required actually having gtk installed for some reason
19:03 < Edible> you cant call something cross platform then expect to install the library
19:07 < Edible> Progers, that java requirement is a nono
19:08 < Progers> Edible: What do u mean?
19:09 < Edible> nothing, nothing...
19:09 < Progers> Ok -_-
19:14 < Progers> Nice new version
19:15 < Progers> Good menu design
19:17 < BotoX> servers \o/ https://i.botox.bz/IMG_20140305_184458.jpg
19:20 < Progers> Hp :D
19:27 <@minus> Edible: Qt requires libs too
19:27 <@matricks> everything requires a lib
19:28 <@minus> Organstrafverfügung
19:28 <@minus> ^ austrian for parking ticket
19:29 < BotoX> man
19:29 < BotoX> I totaly forgot placing some figures in front of these servers
19:29 < BotoX> time to take another picture
19:30 < Progers> Hate this qt5
19:30  * minus mpvs some kurokami
19:30 < Progers> This thing give me many errors
19:30 < Progers> Must find 4.8
19:31 < Progers> minus: You know SDL?
19:36 < BotoX> I seriously need to get a better camera: https://i.botox.bz/IMG_20140305_193203.jpg
19:37 < yemDX> one word comes to mind from that pic
19:37 < BotoX> yes
19:37 < yemDX> nope, "pleb"
19:37 < BotoX> pls.
19:38 < yemDX> they're on the floor????
19:38 < BotoX> I just put them there?????
19:38 < Progers> i just want to say one russian word to this pic "Blyaaaaaa"
19:38 < yemDX> get them off of the floor
19:38 < BotoX> They are already
19:39 < BotoX> I only put them there to be next to the servers for this one picture
19:39 <@minus> Progers: i have used it a tiny bit
19:47 < Progers> I think this site is good to learn some grafics http://lazyfoo.net/
20:53 < Edible> SIP seems to have voice/video but does it have multiuser chat and so forth?
20:54 < Edible> because you can just use jabber for those features i think
20:55 <@minus> SIP is the Session Initiation Protocol. it initializes sessions, nothing more.
20:55 <@minus> well, granted, it does authentication and stuff
20:56 < Edible> so it can have anything inside it?
20:58 < Edible> i'm giving this a try... now if only anybody used it
