19:28 < Dune> wait, jungle was never the default map? (other than during the week between 071 and 072)
19:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ?
19:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> no idea
20:08 < Oy> jungle was only default map in the 0.7 pre release
20:09 < Oy> 0.7.1 already had heavens as default
23:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> How do you think Oy would like me to fix 2554?
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> link?

23:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Learath2 do you know if there are double-clears ever ingame?
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> nope, don't need to clear ingame
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> there aren't even clears ingame if you don't set gfx_clear
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> (the background of the map does the "clear")
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I actually wonder why the menu background needs the clear
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Learath2 well otherwise you get pointer lag I guess?
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Learath2 well otherwise you get pointer ghosting I guess?
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> unless you use a map theme
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> yeah, but the background is rendered before anything, that should be taking care of "clearing" the frame
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> no?
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes, when a background is rendered
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but with "none" the background is transparent
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> but don't we render that checker thing?
