09:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Githubs comments are way more convenient to use. You can upload pictures on the fly and markdowns syntax highlighting is king. You can link other issues easily, and and and...
09:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> On the other hand we got the pretty outdated Teeworlds Forum that feels more like a plain windows text editor.
09:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> 
09:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> I wouldn't agree to split things up onto two very different websites. It doesn't add anything, imo.
09:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes github is bae c:
10:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Github issue/comment quality went down tremendously throughout last few weeks
11:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> That is caused by the hype you created with the new version after such a long waiting time. It will end soon enough, pretty sure. Having all the ideas on github makes things tremendously easier. F. e. the search functionality is way better and helps avoiding to open duplicates.

19:02 < Oy> hey
19:02 < Oy> so we stick to the time on sunday right?
19:03 < Dune> hey
19:03 < Dune> so far so good
19:03 < Dune> heinrich5991 reported he probably won't be there much, sadly
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hello
19:04 < Dune> I pinged everyone, it's probably safe to mail Landil today
19:04 < Oy> ok
19:05 < Oy> if we would postpone it by an hour it probably wouldn't be better right?
19:06 <@heinrich5991> no. I'll see if I can read the conversation on my phone
19:06 < Oy> ok. then we stick to 7pm
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wait what 0.8 this sunday? or what is going on here o.O
19:07 < Dune> no ^^
19:07 < Dune> I posted something for the gameplay issues, Oy, if that works for you
19:08 < Oy> didn't read it yet
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i just glanced at the chat history so what is happening sunday?
19:08 < Dune> alright
19:09 < Dune> been trying to work with the flagstands but it's not that easy, have to somehow parse the map layers :|
19:09 < Oy> email sent
19:09 < Dune> nice, thanks
19:12 < Oy> well it's kinda tricky to draw a line there what should be in the forum and what not
19:12 < Dune> it is
19:12 < Oy> i personally don't read the forum much, except the internal stuff :P
19:12 < Dune> I'd say -anything you'd tag gameplay
19:13 < Dune> well you've been of great help on the support forum :P
19:13 < Dune> but if everyone posts a dozen of gameplay change ideas all the technical stuff is going to get drown fast 
19:14 < Dune> well, I don't know what's the best thing to do
19:14 < Oy> well, yeah the github issues felt spammed lately
19:15 < Dune> I tend to redirect people to github whenever they spot a bug
19:16 < Oy> improvements should be also on github, like with the scoreboard
19:16 < Dune> I guess some saw things addressed very quickly and decided to post more stuff and expect more
19:16 < Dune> well yeah that is true
19:16 < Dune> it's difficult to make a clear ule
19:16 < Dune> rule
19:17 < Oy> yeah, but suggesting a specific new gametype shouldn't be there
19:17 < Oy> f.e.
19:17 < Dune> yeah, but where is the border :|
19:17 < Oy> these laser jumps too
19:17 < Dune> yeah
19:17 < Oy> yeah. ok i tag some with move or sth
19:18 < Dune> but there ought to be some sort of rule or more will pop
19:19 < Oy> well, lets say all gameplay changes/additions should be sorted out in the forum first
19:20 < Dune> it is usually much easier to justify closing issues when you can just quote a rule
19:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> How about large suggestions?
19:21 < Oy> what's large? :D
19:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> like let's say port teeworlds to android
19:21 < Oy> well yeah
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> large as in opposite to small suggestions like move this 5px up
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> good suggestion btw xd
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I feel like github should be directly code-related
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> most of the issues we have are very concrete, "add a race gametype", "fix this fix that"
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> but some recently have been discussion based
19:25 < Oy> add a race gametype isn't very specific
19:26 <@heinrich5991> that was also my thought when you gave that example ;)
19:26 < Oy> like with survival gametype. Landil wrote up 3 pages with uml-diagram, rules descriptions etc.
19:26 < Oy> and then i implemented it that way
19:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I mean the description of that issue felt pretty specific to me:P
19:27 < Oy> not to me
19:27 < Oy> if we take for example the current race mod. that's a single player game with an online highscore
19:27 < Oy> how should be in teeworlds, where we focus on multiplayer
19:28 < Oy> in 0.4 there used to be a race mod, where all players raced against each other
19:28 < Oy> like u know from a car race
19:28 < Oy> that feels more like multiplayer
19:28 <@heinrich5991> in 0.5 there was some sort of "loop race". each round, the slowest player was removed from the game
19:29 < Oy> ko race was it called i think, yeah
19:29 <@heinrich5991> yup
19:29 < Oy> that feels more like multiplayer too
19:29 < Oy> so what should the official one be?
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah right
19:30 < Oy> further more do we set player collision on?
19:30 < Oy> what about weapons?
19:30 < Oy> there are so many unclear things
19:30 < Oy> should there be a saved highscore for maps - we don't have such thing yet
19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> then maybe we should discuss it on the Development forum
19:31 < Oy> if we add it there, should we add it to the other gametypes as well?
19:31 < Oy> yeah, probably best
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and yeah you're totally right there a lot to decide on still
19:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> so that was clearly a poor example on my part ðŸ˜›
19:32 < Oy> :P
19:32 < Oy> that issue was originally opened by matricks on the old track, i just copied it over
19:33 < Oy> was created in 0.3 times i think
19:33 < Oy> there was also a race mod back then, but can't remember how that was like
19:40 < Oy> Dune: should i close the ones that should be discussed in the forum first? or should i just tag them?
19:40 < Oy> tag is "forum discussion"
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I can close when they are ported if not done. Also lock probably
19:50 < Oy> ok
19:50 < Oy> tagged some
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Thx
20:03 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fhfP0
20:03 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 50f6f5d oy: removed debug related code
20:05 < Oy> not sure about the killing spree thing "move to the forum" related
20:06 < Oy> there used to be plans for that in 0.2/0.3? times
20:06 < Oy> probably would need some sounds for it too?
20:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I implemented UT3 sounds :p
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> ut3 sounds in tw lol ðŸ˜„
22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> k-k-killing spree :)
22:51 < rand> *heavy breath*
