22:43 < teetow> cool
22:44 < minus> cool story bro
22:45 < minus> how's it going, teetow
22:45 < teetow> watching poker and cursing the day React.js was born
22:45 < teetow> self?
22:46 < minus> about to boot windows for a round of overwatch
22:46 < minus> switched a small project from react to preact, was ez
22:46 < minus> react seems like the least insane of choices
22:46 < teetow> yeah, I'm at the mercy of my own ignorance, I think
22:47 < teetow> I'm making OBS plugins
22:47 < teetow> and you have to load them as a single HTML page from disk, no JS modules for you or you'll get the CORS banhammer
22:47 < minus> wait, what does js have to do with obs. that's a C++/Qt app isn't it
22:47 < teetow> well
22:47 < teetow> it has a browser source, right?
22:47 < teetow> and that's actually a pretty smart delivery vehicle for screen overlays
22:47 < minus> huh
22:48 < minus> interesting
22:48  * minus has hardly ever used obs
22:48 < teetow> you can just yolo some data over a websocket and absolutely guarantee it won't crash OBS unless CEF itself dies, which is fortunately pretty rare
22:48 < teetow> (Chrome Embedded Framework)
22:49 < teetow> the only drawback is, it's a real pain to use modern js in that context, you basically have to pull React from some CDN and inject it in some shamanistic way to make your own code have access to it
22:49 < teetow> and that's kinda where I'm struggling atm
22:49 < minus> should be fine if you build it with webpack and transpile it to a fitting js version
22:49 < teetow> yeah, I'm good so far
22:50 < minus> (implies that you understand webpack, which i think no one does)
22:50 < teetow> that's a big fat affirmative =) I actually use esbuild just to not have to deal with webpack and their shit
22:50 < teetow> I'm just stuck at the point where I wanna inject React into my code. React right now seems to think it's loaded twice
22:51 < teetow> because it checks for some internal wiring, and finds my skills lacking, I dunno
22:52 < teetow> anyway, I'm keeping you from establishing dominance over the realm of 12-year-olds. Go forth, noble soldier!
22:53 < minus> huehuehue
22:53 < minus> what are you building anyway?
22:53 < teetow> so there's a speedrunner who does long BOTW runs, like 100% and similar categories
22:53 < teetow> I'm helping him out with some overlays
22:54 < teetow> one of them being, you can donate to either kill or save the horse at the end of the run (hat tip to GDQ)
22:54 < teetow> so the horse widget shows a dead or alive horse, and its current "health" (as set by donations / subs)
22:56 < teetow> that kinda thing, basically
