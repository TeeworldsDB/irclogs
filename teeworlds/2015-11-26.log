01:27 < NiKiS> hello, my friends
01:28 < NiKiS> heinrich5991, matricks so the problem with illuminati continues
01:28 < NiKiS> now they are using some "getinfo flood" to stop our server from appearing in the servers list
01:29 < NiKiS> can you do anything about it?
01:29 < NiKiS> or you still don't care? -_-
01:43 < NiKiS> ok i think i received the answer in pm
01:43 < NiKiS> there's nothing you can really do about it xD
01:44 <@heinrich5991> what's a getinfo flood though?
02:44 < Stitch626> these bug will be fixed in 0.7.
08:21 <@matricks> NiKiS: the bug should be fixed
18:02 < CaptainTeemo> hello
21:47 < Slinack> hi everyone! my friend is having this weird issue with the master servers (sometimes): having set sv_port 8303 and sv_register 1, the masterserver lists the server as ip-address:8307
21:48 < Slinack> if we were to type "connect ip-address:8303" it'd work, and anyone would be able to access the server. But since the port is wrong on the server list, no info is retrieved and nobody can join
21:48 < Slinack> what could cause that?
