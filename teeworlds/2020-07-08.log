04:43 < bridge> [freenode] <CharlieFish> hi~, em.. It seems servers got DDoS attack again. (O.O;
08:34 < bridge> [freenode] <CharlieFish> hi? anybody here? O.O
09:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Learath2 `deep` or `layer` blueprints, so you can copy and paste stuff from one map to another
09:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> "you don't have to reinvent the wheel"
09:34 < ChillerDragon> so similiar to the already existing feature "append" but just snippets not whole maps?
09:34 < ChillerDragon> like building blocks?
09:35 < ChillerDragon> you can already do that by selecting a area using shift from one map and paste it in another map
10:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> We have brushes in ddnet. Something similar can be implemented to persist through a load. But one issue would be that brushes depend on a certain layer structure
10:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> cut-copy-paste will be better imo
10:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> like in each graphic editor
18:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Had a mass crash today. 10 out of 12 people crashed at the same time on a regular vanilla server =\
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> ddos?
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Nope. Bandwidth was normal and server wasn't laggy. There was a vote and suddenly most clients crashed
19:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> map vote?
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @redix do you have the config? sometimes the last entry is of interest
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> s\/config/log
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Checked the log too late =\ I'm only keeping the tw logs for a few hours
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> core dump? ðŸ˜„
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Nope :D
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Strange that two clients didn't crash
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Oh the people ingame crashed
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> that's rough
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Dont think it was a vote for a map change. Just some option.
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> so it did happen on vote?
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I think there was a running vote yeah
21:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I'll take a look around the vote code, see if there is anything there that looks suspicious
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Well I never saw something like that hwppening before :/
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @oy this does not work for me
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/726bb67e129be9f4b902ce61d9cbf20f6dc0a2b5#diff-dab5fcb897efd8b09195abaaa043e621R104
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it says `PREV_CLIENT_VERSION` not found
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (in my mod)
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> do you know how i get it to work?
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if I include game/version.h in engine/client.h it works
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but its not like that in vanilla, mh
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> engine/shared/config.h*
