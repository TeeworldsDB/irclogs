01:10 < minus> localized error messages are the worst
01:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the wurst
01:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :D
01:42  * minus shows jxsl13 the door
13:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes, but at least the error codes are uniform
16:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> has somebody still connections to MAP64? He created the N-Client and N-Server
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> MAP94 *
18:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> Heard that name but dunno nclient and nserver is it related to the NUT ddrace maps ?
21:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> n-client/n-server was that project, with a lua interface for the server
21:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> could be a good framework for the future
23:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> ah cool
