10:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> In 0.6 it was possible to set m_Local in the snap of CPlayer in pPlayerInfo. Is that still possible somehow in 0.7?
10:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Well, its not possible to set it without reconnecting, right? As I see its set in the NewClientInfoMsg
11:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @oy, could there be some hack way to set m_Local to 0, and later to 1 again for a specific player?
18:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> How to compile 0.7 in debug with cmake?
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's in debug by default as there is a logic error in the cmake file that kind of makes debug default and release non default. I think you can use gdb or lldb to check if there are debugging symbols available.
18:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> line 76 in the CMakeLists.txt is the differentiation.
18:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you can also use `file` on the executable
18:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in general, for cmake projects, use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to get the debug build
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 wait, wasn't the a PR that fixed that?
18:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hmm. I wonder where that fix went
18:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> you mean `make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`
18:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ?
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nvm
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> just use cmake ..
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it will make a debugging version until that line 76 might be fixed some time. later you would need to use the flag -DDEV=ON
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `so cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..` and then make is false?
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..` and then make is false?
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dunno if that would make a difference, might add that as well, in. nirmal cmake projects that flag is actually the way to go. just use it.
