13:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Dune what do you mean you couldn't get /w to work at all?
13:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> can you check the console output, see whether the command is being called at all
13:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> /whisper works not /w
13:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Im eating, later
13:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> well, fwiw works for me
13:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Learath2 it just sends it to the server
13:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `[chat-command]: calling 'w' with args ''`
13:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Dune well /w requires arguments
13:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> and that line doesn't mean it's sent to the server
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It is though
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It goes to the chat
13:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Learath2 I have difficulties reproducing, sorry, could have been on the wrong branch or something
13:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> /w does go to the chat though...
13:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> [2020-04-15 13:49:20][chat-command]: calling 'w' with args ''
13:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> [2020-04-15 13:49:20][chat]:  1: Dune: /w
13:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> you just write /w and press enter?
13:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah. that's a bug
13:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> oh indeed
13:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Dune if we are typing a command, even if parsing fails don't send it?
13:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes, anything that starts with a / must not be sent, unless escape is pressed, that's a security
13:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ideally, autocompletion/validation of commands should be changed to space/tab only, to make return presses safer
13:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> (it's very tricky stuff I know)
13:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I don't quite get how it used to work before tbh, I don't see that behaviour there
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can check 0.7.3 for that
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> or you mean in the code?
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Dune try the new commit
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Yeah I meant in the code
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ok
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah, there is one difference with behaviour from previous versions there, and I see I wrote the specifications wrong: it should not send it as long as there is an active commands menus. Escape closes the menus, so it's supposed to be intuitive that you have to close menus to send the command
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you may disagree on that though
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> otherwise works fine
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> did I somewhere along the way break something about the commands?
14:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Is the menu supposed to be active after you hit space?
14:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> for example, when you type `/\ssa: hi` there should be (and there is no) menus
14:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but the message still doesn't get sent before you press escape to exit from some hypothetical invisible menus: that's the thing that changed
14:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> hmm, idk how to encode this behaviour in terms of the variables we have
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Dune currently, there is no menu, but the code still wont send it before you esc out of the non existant menu?
14:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> try to send `/\ssa: hi`
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> however when typing a command the menu does indeed disappear after the initial part of the command
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's weird
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> huh, lemme test
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> this is another change in behaviour
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> this was not the case in 0.7.3
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ah, now it makes sense
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I guess we lost that behaviour along the way
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> most likely yes, it's hard to regression test this because there are a lot of cases :)
14:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Instead of filtering chat commands according to the entire input string, maybe I should do it with only the initial token
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> so hard to replicate :/
14:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Dune I think I got it this time
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> it's not always so easy to put these concepts we can easily imagine into concrete logic on the variables we have access to
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I agree @Learath2 , especially since there was very little abstraction around this feature, it's all hacked into the chat code
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Learath2 doesn't work, once I exit the menus once I can't seem to get commands working again
15:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ?
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You type a command, you exit the menu, you can never use commands again?
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> In the subset of things I tried. It works fine, so you'll need to tell me how to reproduce this
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> 1) start to type a command
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> 2) type escape
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> 3) open chat again, try to type a command
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Hmm, works fine for me, do you get out of chat with escape too?
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> wait, maybe I did not pull the last commit
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> "start typing command, escape, escape, open chat, type /" is exactly what I'm doing
15:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I can still reproduce
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> maybe it depends on the command and how much of the command you typed?
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes it does
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> in order: T, /mu, escape, escape, T, /
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> works completely fine for me, that means undefined behaviour ðŸ˜¦
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> same procedure with /w works fine...
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> oh I got it to happen somehow
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> T + /, + esc + esc + t + / works for me
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you mean, works or reprodcues the bug?
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> yeah, reproduces it and I fixed it
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I was having an issue with cirular logic
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> `IsTypingCommand` would be stuck false because there were no commands rendered, because handle commands wouldn't run unless `IsTypingCommand`
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Dune Okay this time, for sure
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> hopefully(tm)
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It would be good if you could test it extensively
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Now if I try to whisper someone, and I tab, it erases it
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `/whisper Lea`<TAB> --> `/whisper ` instead of /whisper Learath
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> how do you even come up with these testcases?
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I just enter a server and try random commands
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I try like 50 things before pushing it, you find the 1 thing that breaks it
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ha ok, bad luck :D
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> This was going to be a small pr, now it'll need to be squished :/
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Okay, I tested this commit for 10 minutes and the only thing I can come up with isn't in the scope of this PR
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> (add a way to signify parsing failure to the user (maybe a red background flash?))
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> sounds like a nice feature to do in another PR :)
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> though I'm more concerned about signalling that the user is out of command mode (and will send a command as raw text)
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I wanted to write a GUI where the command is part of the chat mode header (where it says "All") but that branch got stale :P
19:40 < ChillerDragun> Did apt rename the server binary from teeworlds_srv to teeworlds-server? And why?
19:40 < ChillerDragun> I really liked the teeworlds_srv binary name but i noticed after installing it via apt it seemed to have teeworlds-server there.
19:41 < ChillerDragun> I wonder if there is some styleguide for linux binarys? I mean i can not think of any binary including underscores. All use dashes.
19:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]> i always try to write teeworlds-srv because im used to - on linux
19:55 < ChillerDragun> yea seems like its a more common style to use dashes i could not find anything about it online tho
19:56 < ChillerDragun> im not sure about srv vs server
19:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> hi chillerdragon
19:56 < ChillerDragun> yo
19:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> Are you online rn on a srv?
19:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> I need you for smth :D
19:56 < ChillerDragun> no :D
19:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> Come on
19:56 < ChillerDragun> pm me on irc or get wire
19:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> I pm you to get discord
19:57 < ChillerDragun> :troll:
19:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> :troll:
19:58 < ChillerDragun> oh btw you can use https://zillyhuhn.com/TeeStalker/ tee see when im online
19:58 < ChillerDragun> oh well might be 0.6 only so thats probably useless
19:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> Wow you troll
19:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> Could you come online for few minutes?
20:02 < ChillerDragun> ok ill join zcatch real quick but please do not use this public irc to contact me in the future :/
20:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> We will see!
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> Where are you ChillerDragon
20:09 < ChillerDragun> sorry had a different identity im on now
20:19 < Trafalgar_Law> I have to use now quakenet because of ChillerDragon, help
20:37 < ChillerDragun> lol its funny when you search "multiplayer game" on rubygems there are only 19 hits and there is no quake, minecraft, roblox or any other game id expect there. But a teeworlds related gem :D nice
