15:36 < day> Sadale: ha i knew that ive seen your name before!
15:37 < day> *saw you ingame days/weeks ago*
15:37 < Sadale> day, hi :3
15:38 < day> Sadale: are you on freenode as well?
15:38 < Sadale> day, I played teeworlds like five years ago under another nick. Then I stopped playing for a long time until now. Now I spend my time AFKing in a city most of the time :p
15:38 < day> pretty sure thats from where i know you
15:38 < Sadale> day, yes. I guess I've seen you in freenode
15:38 < Sadale> same
15:39 < Sadale> day, not sure which channel did I meet you, tho. Maybe ##proramming or #anime. IDK
15:39 < day> Sadale: anime pretty sure :D
15:39 < day> Sadale: pro ramming sounds interesting tho
15:39 < Sadale> what;s pro ramming/
15:40 <@matricks> lol
15:40 < day> idk man. you tell me :D
15:40 <@matricks> sound like Bazzers is involved
15:41 <@matricks> or is it brazzer? dunno
15:41 < day> does anyone here know Shubi? Wondering if hes still playing
15:41 < Sadale> day, oh. *facepalm*
15:41 < day> matricks: how is the steam greenlight project going?
15:42 <@matricks> day: don't ask me
15:43 <@matricks> day: I don't do anything teeworlds now adays and I'm opposed to the whole steam thing
15:45 < day> oh, i thought you are still involved. Mind telling me why you disagree with ?free publicity? ?
15:45 <@matricks> day: I'm against all centralized systems
15:46 <@matricks> giving away your data to someone else for them to control
15:46 <@matricks> and then screwing you over when you don't wanna do as they want anymore
15:48 <@matricks> it always end bad
15:48 < day> i guess.
15:49 < Sadale> what data do you need to give stream for having your game listed in steam?
15:49 < day> or / what data do you give up?
15:50 <@matricks> Sadale: well, they have all your games as hostage if you don't do as they say
15:50 < Sadale> matricks, interesting point.
15:50 < day> i think tw can be easily ripped out again into status quo
15:51 < Sadale> But teeworlds is an open source game anyway.
15:51 < day> that doesnt matter
15:51 <@matricks> day: tw yeah, but supporting the whole infrastructure is just, icky
15:51 < Sadale> day, true. that's irrelevant.
15:51 < Sadale> But how they can have teeworlds as a hostage?
15:51 <@matricks> this doesn't apply to teeworlds
15:51 < day> the second you let them store convienient stuff like stats etc. your users will go apeshit if you go standalone again. doesnt matter if its opensource or not.
15:52 < Sadale> matricks, ah.
15:52 <@matricks> it applys to all the other games you buy off steam
15:52 < Sadale> day, good point.
15:52 <@matricks> can't integrate the stats etc for teeworlds
15:52 <@matricks> if they do that, I'm gonna be really really sad
15:52 < day> Sadale: the 'is playing teeworlds' is already a small integration/ convenience
15:52 < day> matricks: i know, just an example
15:53 <@matricks> I hate everytime I wanna play a game and it's only available on fuckin steam
15:54 < koomi> who's supposed to do the steam integration anyway? it's a lot of work and I have never seen it work out for an open source game
15:54 <@matricks> koomi: dunno, and dunno how it can be done
15:54 < EastByte> heinrich5991 is working on it
15:54 <@matricks> koomi: steam api etc can't go into the code
15:54 < Sadale> Maybe we can make a new branch?
15:54 <@matricks> Sadale: no
15:54 < day> no
15:55 <@matricks> Sadale: steam api can't go into the code, period
15:55 < day> you cant strip the license
15:55 < Sadale> Hey! How could it supposed to be done then?
15:55 < Sadale> matricks, ok. :/
15:55 <@matricks> well, he can fork the project and make a closed source version for steam
15:55 < Sadale> A game can get listed even if steam api isn't integrated?
15:55 <@matricks> and then I will be really really fuckin sad
15:55 <@matricks> Sadale: dunno
15:55 < Sadale> intergrating steam api violates the license?
15:56 <@matricks> Sadale: I'm guessing that the steam api stuff is under NDA
15:56 < Sadale> interesting :o
15:56 <@matricks> Sadale: which means someone has to sign one to implement that stuff
15:56 < Sadale> oh well :(
15:56 <@matricks> which means that that code can't be released
15:56 <@matricks> which ends up being a separate version of teeworlds
15:56 <@matricks> should have made teeworlds gpl :/
15:57 < koomi> does the teeworlds license allow closed-source redistribution?
15:57 <@matricks> koomi: yes
15:57 <@matricks> koomi: all mods doesn't need to show source for an example
15:57 < koomi> I see
15:58 < day> oh i thought it doesnt
15:58 <@matricks> I don't know how the integration works, and how much work is going to be done etc, so I'm just guessing a bit here
15:58 < Sadale> well, I won't be happy if there's a close-course redistribution :<
15:58 <@matricks> Sadale: I would feel violated
15:59 <@matricks> I would push for the open source version to go for GPL actually
15:59 < day> it would be rock bottom for the project :x
15:59 < day> who is able to change the license?
15:59 <@matricks> dunno how you would actually do that
15:59 < Sadale> day, no one. lol.
15:59 < koomi> all past contributers would have to agree
16:00 < day> Sadale: well the maintainer could just sneak it in :p
16:00 < Sadale> In theory, yes. In practice, I think having active developers to agree is enough
16:01 < day> im amazed it isnt already gpl
16:01 < Sadale> day, it have been BSD.
16:02 < day> if someone else is going to make money with a closed source version of the game then matricks is going to commit suicide :x
16:02 <@matricks> day: has already been done
16:02 <@matricks> day: for android
16:03 <@matricks> anyway, I'm gonna go and socialize with some "people"
16:03 <@matricks> :)
16:03 < day> isnt that one free?
16:03 < Sadale> fortunately there're instruction for compiling android version of teeworlds
16:03 <@matricks> day: search for dinosmash
16:03 <@matricks> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km7EdnrgvTY
16:03 < Sadale> matricks, interesting :o
16:04 <@matricks> reskinned teeworlds
16:04 < Sadale> interesting. Didn't look like teeworlds
16:05 < day> matricks: :(
16:05 < Sadale> s/didn't/doesn't/
16:06 < Sadale> It's sort of weird. We're sad of it even the license allow so :3
16:09 < day> im not sad for it. its just sad how the whole project backfired from the very beginning for the initial devs.
16:11 < day> its probably good that we have the bsd licence, otherwise people would break the gpl without any consequences. I cant see anyone laywering up for teeworlds
16:14 < Sadale> day, true.
17:03 <@minus> hello. tl;dr
17:03 <@minus> do we even have any steam specific code? (ping heinrich5991)
18:07 < green_snow> hey
18:10 < green_snow> when I am trying to compile an old 0.6.1 teeworlds source, I get strange errors:
18:10 < green_snow> http://pastebin.com/a0ES48mR
18:10 < green_snow> how to fix them?
18:17 <@minus> green_snow: are you compiling unmodified teeworlds 0.6.1 source?
18:17 < green_snow> it is modified, but I can guarantee that this part was not modified
18:17 < rand> I guess the source are modified, and there is a `using namespace std;` somewhere in player.h
18:18 < green_snow> let me see
18:18 <@minus> that and somehow locale forward declarations are included
18:19 <@minus> easiest fix is probably to change that call to ::time_get()
18:19 < rand> +1
18:21 < green_snow> It helped, thank you very much :)
21:07 < heinrich5991> minus: we don't have any steam specific code
21:09 < heinrich5991> (and we don't need any to publish it on steam)
21:23 < koomi> so you could get teeworlds on steam but without the steam overlay thingy?
21:24 < heinrich5991> the steam overlay thingie is injected by steam
21:24 < heinrich5991> without any code
21:24 < koomi> uh, ok
21:25 < koomi> so what do you actually have to do to publish on steam?
21:25 <@minus> new trailer & screenshots afaik
21:25 < heinrich5991> provide them with executables and a bunch of graphics and the trailer
21:25 <@minus> those will be nice for the homepage too
21:26 < heinrich5991> in the forum you can read a bit about it
21:26 < heinrich5991> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11427
21:28 < koomi> ok, sounds like a lot less work than I had anticipated
21:28 < heinrich5991> (I guess the hardest part is getting accepted on steam via greenlight)
21:32 < foxlet> Teeworlds is going to be sold on Steam?
21:33 < koomi> I have seen a couple of FOSS games fail after getting accepted
21:35 < heinrich5991> foxlet: it will still be free as in beer on steam
21:35 < heinrich5991> (and as in liberty, you can still get the code)
21:37 < foxlet> heinrich5991: And Linux support?
21:38 < heinrich5991> foxlet: just as before, supported
21:39 < foxlet> heinrich5991: For what architectures?
21:39 < heinrich5991> x86 and x86_64 I'd guess
21:41 < koomi> steam doesn't run on anything else AFAIK
21:41 < heinrich5991> I have no idea, these are the only platforms with downloads for teeworlds
21:41 < foxlet> heinrich5991: The Steam Client on Linux is only i386, they use multilib for x86_64 systems.
21:43 < foxlet> It might be an issue in some distros without multiarch support, if Teeworlds is put out as i386 only.
21:44 < koomi> they can't use steam anyway
21:45 < koomi> but you can still install/download a x86_64 build of teeworlds
21:46 < heinrich5991> foxlet: you can also download teeworlds through their repositories
21:50 < foxlet> Fair enough.
21:51 < foxlet> heinrich5991: Someone is going to sign the OS X Steam builds, right?
21:51 < foxlet> Otherwise Gatekeeper will stop it from running with Apple’s defaults.
21:57 < heinrich5991> foxlet: steam will take care of that Ithink
22:12 < foxlet> heinrich5991: It doesn’t seem to be the case, many of the games from Steam are unsigned, while some are.
22:12 < heinrich5991> oh ok
22:12  * matricks is actually codin at home
22:12 < heinrich5991> for work?
22:12 <@matricks> naa, for fun
22:13 < foxlet> There doesn’t seem to be a common signature in any of them, at least according to codesign and pagestuff.
22:13 <@minus> wtf matricks, are you sick?
22:13 <@minus> i'll go make you some tea
22:13 < EastByte> matricks currently not in the air?
22:13 <@matricks> :D
22:13 <@matricks> EastByte: nope
22:13 < EastByte> =)
22:13 <@minus> whatcha doin?
22:13 < Learath2> next step codin in the air
22:14 <@matricks> minus: igc viewer :)
22:14 <@matricks> in rust!
22:14 <@minus> igc?
22:14 <@matricks> dunno what igc stands for :/
22:14 <@matricks> http://carrier.csi.cam.ac.uk/forsterlewis/soaring/igc_file_format/
22:14 <@matricks> tracklog
22:14 <@minus> aye
22:14 <@minus> UI?
22:15 <@matricks> just opengl right now
22:15 <@minus> o
22:15 <@matricks> trying to load some height data
22:15 <@minus> so actually 3D navigatable
22:15 <@minus> reminds me to submit my opengl project with height data for grading
22:15 <@matricks> yeah, tracklogs from my flight instrument, wanna visualize them in 3d
22:16 <@matricks> there is stuff that does this online, but internet connection is spotty around the world :)
22:16 <@matricks> and I wanna do some analysis on it
22:16 < heinrich5991> in rust :)
22:16 <@minus> need bsplines to interpolate between sample points? :3
22:16 < heinrich5991> do you have any circular dependencies?
22:17 <@matricks> minus: no, enough samples
22:17 <@matricks> for now
22:17 <@matricks> heinrich5991: no, I can actually code
22:17 < heinrich5991> matricks: come on, teeworlds has those too
22:17 < heinrich5991> like engine -> game and reverse
22:17 <@minus> circular deps suck. i have a python project that has one. works fine untill i try to make it into a proper module
22:18 <@matricks> heinrich5991: have no such problems yet
22:18 <@matricks> quite small right now so
22:19 <@minus> how many kSLOC?
22:19 <@matricks> 360 lines
22:21 <@minus> post results when available
22:21 <@minus> meanwhile i shall consult my bed for sweet dreams
22:21 <@minus> night o/
22:22 <@matricks> night
22:23 < foxlet> Well, I guess I’ll try an ARM build of Teeworlds just for toying around.
22:23 < foxlet> PowerPC works quite well, surprisingly.
22:24 <@matricks> :) had a server running on an gp2x before :)
22:24 < heinrich5991> foxlet: is your arm big-endian?
22:25 <@minus> matricks: you have a gp2x?
22:25 <@matricks> minus: two of em
22:25 <@minus> :o
22:25 <@minus> wanted to get one, or rather a wiz, years ago
22:26 <@minus> but since i'm already gone to bed i'll talk no further
22:27  * koomi used to play on his OpenPandora at school
22:33 < foxlet> heinrich5991: It’s ARMv7, so it isn’t the legacy mode from pre-ARMv6.
22:34 < heinrich5991> foxlet: that doesn't ring a bell for me, I don't know whether v7 or v6 are big-/little-endian
22:36 < foxlet> heinrich5991: They’re configurable, you can compile for both type of endianess.
22:36 < heinrich5991> ah
22:39 < foxlet> heinrich5991: The only specific part is that any binaries built prior to ARMv6 would use BE-32, a legacy mode that is not supported outside of v7-R.
