15:58 < new_tee> hi , guys i have a question about compiling , i have windows 64bit i need to compile source for making client 64bit , i now how i can compile in windows 32bit but is there any different between windows 32 & 64 commands for compiling ?
16:09 <@minus> new_tee: which version of teeworlds?
16:10 <@minus> for master i think it's enough to just `bam arch=x86`
16:11 < new_tee> 0.6.x
16:11 <@minus> no idea then
16:12 < new_tee> this cmd "bam client_release" is same for compiling 64bit teeworlds ?
16:13 <@minus> oh, now i know how it works on windows
16:13 <@minus> you need to call the vcvarsall before executing bam, right?
16:13 < new_tee> i know
16:13 <@minus> there's one for x86 and one for x86_64
16:13 < new_tee> For 64 Bit PCs:
16:14 < new_tee> %comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" x86
16:14 <@minus> that should be 32bit
16:14 < new_tee> no i want 64bit client
16:14 <@minus> x86_64 or x64 or amd64 should be for 64bit
16:15 < new_tee> can you make an example ?
16:15 < new_tee> i need to change x86 to x64 >? in this cmd ?
16:15 < new_tee> %comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files (x64)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" x64
16:15 < new_tee> ?
16:15 <@minus> yes
16:15 < new_tee> why isnt any toturial for this ?
16:16 < new_tee> hmm iddnt know
16:16 < new_tee> after this bam client_release this is same on 32bit
16:16 < new_tee> and 64bit
16:42 < Stitch626> you should also use 64-bit compiled version of bam, ich think. i personally use both, x64 bam and x64 call of the script. ^^
16:43 < new_tee> how i can compile 64bit compile bam ?
16:43 < new_tee> :/
16:43 < Stitch626> there should be a script for it
16:44 < new_tee> i have Bam 4.0
16:44 < new_tee> but there isnt any .bat file for 64bit
16:44 < Stitch626> *0.4.0, its not 4.0
16:44 < new_tee> o_O
16:45 < new_tee> yes it is https://github.com/downloads/matricks/bam/bam-0.4.0.zip
16:45 < Stitch626> there is one, but just for ms vc 2005. i've just use my own pre-compiled versions so dunno
16:45 < Stitch626> eh
16:45 < Stitch626> there.
16:46 < Stitch626> take a look into win32 bat, there is a line which contents "call %VSPATH%vsvars32.bat", if i remember alright change it to vsvars64.bat
16:46 < Stitch626> if that won't work i should search my compile script ^^
16:48 < Stitch626> in version 0.5 of bam there is a script, but its a little bit different. maybe it works?
17:07 < Stitch626> okay. i found a not-so-nice but working solution for 64 bit compiling of bam 0.4 :)
17:10 < new_tee> ?
17:12 < new_tee> whats your solution ?
17:12 < new_tee> i dont think we need compile bam in 64
17:12 < new_tee> just use this %comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files (x64)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" x64 is enough i think
18:56 < new_tee> ahhh
18:56 < new_tee> whats the problem ?
18:56 < new_tee> C:\ddnet-master\ddnet-master>%comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" x86_ia64
18:56 < new_tee> The specified configuration type is missing.  The tools for the
18:57 < new_tee> configuration might not be installed.
19:01 < new_tee> ah sombody help
19:21 < luca> Bro...x64 isn't 64-Bit!
19:24 < luca> maybe a bit confusing
19:25 < new_tee> i think i need http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb980924.aspx caz i have vs 2010 express c++
19:27 < luca> Check those two...maybe you'll find some help.   -https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx/master/circle.yml   -https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet-scripts/blob/master/ddnet-release.sh
19:28 < new_tee> i need to compile bam for 64bit to ? or jus use make_win32_msvc.bat is enough ?
19:28 < new_tee> i dont know why there isnt any toturial for 64bit :/
19:33 < Stitch626> visual c++ express (2010) isnt able to compile in 64-bit. simple answer, no?
19:39 < luca> Well it should be the same like 32, BUT %comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" x86 with Programm Files →(86)←)
19:40 < luca> And then just c:\bam\bam release
19:41 < luca> But If I was you...use linux...it's just one comand for compiling :)
19:45 < luca> Or you use this one:https://github.com/AllTheHaxx/AllTheHaxx/blob/master/bam.lua
19:46 < luca> You don't need to compile bam here I guess...Well I didn't had to so try it...maybe I am wrong...I am using linux for 5 years now...so no clue about win...you may need to change some params
19:46 < Stitch626> i think that would change nothing? the most problematic is the environment itself, not bam
19:47 < luca> Mhmm no Idea :§ I gave him all my help I can give to a win user :D
19:47 < Stitch626> :D
19:48 < Stitch626> i'm also win user, and sometimes little bit linux but i've never set up a cross-compiling setup
19:48 < luca> I am struggeling with crosscomp
19:48 < luca> SO :D
19:51 < luca> Well new_tee, I guess you either need to crosscompile  with mingw or something, or u use vs compiling
