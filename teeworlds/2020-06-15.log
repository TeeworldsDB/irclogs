13:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Hey, has anyone ever heard of slow or smooth over-head emotes? I have asked this already in the ddnet channel some months ago i think, but no one could give me an answer.
13:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Okay so on basically every server, when doing an emote with lshift, it pops up quite fast and isnt so smooth. But on the fng2+ server by noby the emote animation is slower/smoother and i have no clue why. Nobody seems to know why
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> is that a 0.6-only thing?
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> noby has his fng server also compaitble for 0.7 now, and its the same there
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i have absolutely no idea how
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its just an animation xD how can the server change the speed? noby said he has no idea aswell
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> maybe it's related to ping?
15:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You could maybe manipulate EmoteStart by messing with the tick
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> he said he checked on both 0.6 and 0.7, and also ddrace and other fng servers besides mine
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Learath2 the emote start is for eye emotes isnt it
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> nope
19:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> but it's irrelevant anyway, noby isn't doing any gametick sorcery and there is no other way to manipulate emote start
19:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> mg
19:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> mh*
19:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> whats gametick sorcery :o
