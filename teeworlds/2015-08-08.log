05:51 < Sadale> I'm looking for the name of a race map(probably nrace). It was very old(like 5 years ago). It has multiple parts. It has blue background at the beginning. In later parts, the backgrounds changes with rainbow color(like the H value of HSV changing). and in other later parts, it has black background.
20:25 < Kamparano> I'm an (well, the only) Esperanto translator for Teeworlds. This morning I translated 20% on Transifex.
20:26 < Kamparano> How can I convert these to the .txt translation format Teeworlds uses?
20:56 < Sadale> Kamparano, mi estas komercisto. Mi dormas nun. Äœis. :p
21:01 < Kamparano> ping @matricks @minus
