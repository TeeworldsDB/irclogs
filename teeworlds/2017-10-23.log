15:27 < O7h3rw153> Hi mates
15:28 <@matricks> oi
15:28 < O7h3rw153> The Teeworlds app on macOS seems broken
15:28 < O7h3rw153> Any idea how to solve that ?
15:35 < O7h3rw153> Apparently the binary cant find the SDL library (according to the logs) but it is there nevertheless
15:36 < O7h3rw153> I also installed it on my local /Library/Frameworks (just in case)
15:37 < O7h3rw153> When running an older version (0.6.3) it works great so I guess the dev just didn't test the latest version. Thanks to let him know that it doesn't work on mac. Have a good day !
