00:01 <@Dune> dang
00:01 <@Dune> good job Oy
00:02 <@Dune> simplified chinese looks like a false positive too?
00:02 <@Dune> whoops, already said
00:02 < rand> Dune: you should retry issue #1752, the m_PlayerSlots in NETMSGTYPE_SV_SERVERSETTINGS was also clamp to 0,16
00:03 <@Dune> aight rand
00:04 < rand> your client dropped packet saying that there were > 16 player slots
00:05 < rand> then, since the slots were all filled, the client did not want to change team
00:05 < rand> maybe we should add an exception when going to spectators
00:06 < rand> src/game/client/components/menus_ingame.cpp:CMenus::GetSwitchTeamInfo
00:07 < rand> anyway, bedtime, gn8
00:07 <@Dune> yeah +1
00:12 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpoAm
00:12 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master c87fcb2 oy: check for valid placeholders within translation files
11:25 < rand> Oy: about this fix, I think it's better to consume at least 2 characters instead of one when meating a %
11:26 < rand> '%s' and '%' triggers a false positive while it is positive
11:30 < Oy> rand: huh, that shouldn't trigger the false positive
11:31 < rand> nvm, I'm wrong
11:32 < rand> still, better consume 2
11:33 < rand> '%%something' vs '%%'
11:34 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpKmB
11:34 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master c0efc8b oy: fixed a dependency problem with the protocol
11:39 < Oy> well yeah it could consume all following % then
11:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> So gotta make a pass through locales right?
11:44 < rand> the 64p PR add a locale "other players"
11:45 < rand> (that could be change for "players" or another existant locale)
11:45 < Oy> Dune the ones that are faulty should be fixed
11:45 < Oy> rand: there are more localizations missing
11:46 <@Dune> yeah like hide bots
11:46 < rand> ok
11:49 < Oy> so what's up with the team change bug?
11:50 <@Dune> hold on
11:50 <@Dune> seems to work just finenow
11:51 <@Dune> on rand's server at least
11:53 <@Dune> there seems to be a bug
11:53 <@Dune> I can't join red team no matter how much I click on it
11:54 <@Dune> but I get no notification of that
11:55 < rand> the button should be locked
11:57 < rand> what is the expected behavior ? 
11:57 <@Dune> i'm not sure
11:59 < Oy> you can't change a bigger team when the team difference would be bigger than 1 then
11:59 <@Dune> yeah of course, but on the UI
11:59 <@Dune> the game mechanics work well, it's just that nothing is displayed
12:42 < rand> Dune,Oy: found
12:42 <@Dune> oh nice
12:42 < rand> one among health and armor can be 0
12:42 <@Dune> oh
12:43 < rand> damage are dropped if you don't loose both
12:43 <@Dune> you're right
12:43 <@Dune> that's because of network.py
12:43 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/c0efc8b3eaae10ab8053f992742168db28510e56/datasrc/network.py#L234

13:12 < rand> should bots be report in the NumPlayers ?
13:12 < rand> i guess obviously yesâ€¦ 
13:12 <@Dune> my guess too
13:17 < Oy> yeah, but set the bot flag for them
13:17 < Oy> in the server info
13:17 <@Dune> would be nice to have the bot countryflag ready
13:17 < rand> does the client compute these number ?
13:17 <@Dune> yeah rand

15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hey I'm doing the truncated chat thing btw
15:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> stop me now if you're already on it ðŸ˜ƒ
15:33 <@Dune> the script to generate localization strings doesn't work for me :c
15:34 <@Dune> FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data/languages/base.pot'
15:34 <@Dune> (that file should be created)
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> why does my server disappear from the server list
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> when i put player slots to 16
15:35 <@Dune> because it is pure probably?
15:35 <@Dune> try sv_gametype MOD
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> but 16 players should be pure lol
15:36 <@Dune> ah
15:36 <@Dune> but player slots > 16 keeps it in the server list?
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> and i have no filters applied btw
15:37 < rand> you still see the server "Random" ?
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> anything above sv_players_slots 8 gets hidden
15:38 < rand> what is MaxClients ?
15:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> what does max clients do
15:39 < rand> sv_max_clients
15:39 < rand> it defines how many network client the server will handle
15:40 < rand> atm sv_player_slots must be lower than sv_max_clients
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i've put it to 64 just now
15:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> nothing changed
15:40 < rand> it's not mutable
15:41 < rand> you can't change this on the fly, that is a runtime constant
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i've reloaded
15:41 < rand> you have to restart the server
15:42 < Oy> LordSK go ahead :)
15:42 < rand> then fixing this + sanitize player_slots to stay lower than max_clients 
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i've put player slots to 16
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> shouldnt it display 0/16 in the server browser
15:43 < Oy> that player_slots thing should be fixed
15:43 < Oy> yeah
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> instead of 0/64
15:44 < Oy> oh do u have max_clients to 64?
15:44 <@Dune> depends on the option you check, Sonix
15:44 < Oy> then it's 0/64
15:44 < Oy> check "show only player" in filters then it shows 0/16
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix "Count players only" = 0/16
15:44 < Oy> tfilters the 48 spectator salots
15:44 < rand> better make a specific function or sanitize the option after the ConchainSettingUpdate ?
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> so many new configs
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah
15:45 < Oy> it used to sv_spectator before i think
15:46 < Oy> rand either option is good i think
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> btw
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> we should put a pop up notification once you join spec
15:47 < rand> what is the difference between Chain() and Register() ?
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> "click on a player or a flag to spectate it"
15:48 <@Dune> well you'd have to press the spectate button first sonix
15:48 <@Dune> right
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> once you join spec i said
15:49 < Oy> register - registers a command to the console with a function which is called when u execute it; chain executes the linked function when you change f.e. a config variable like sv_register
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> most ppl dont know that u can click on players to follow them
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> without using rshift
15:50 < Oy> yeah Sonix good idea
15:50 <@Dune> http://puu.sh/CbcH8/ebb011d362.png
15:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> lol dune
15:50 <@Dune> I forgot how big ingame buttons looked
15:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> thanks for moving the buttons top again Oy
15:51 <@Dune> yeah thank god

16:19 < Oy> 0.7.1 complete \o/
16:22 < Oy> making a list of changes in the forum, if someone wants to add sth. there's so much, can't remember everything
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> some scoreboard feedback from zatline and myself....
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> 1. countryflag is to big, make it the same height as the tee/font
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> 2. switch countryflag with score
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> 3. make scoeboard a fixed height(looks so crammed)
16:26 < Oy> country flag has the same height as the tee
16:26 < Oy> score should be next to kill deah - seperating them is odd
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> country flag is bigger
16:27 < Oy> it's wider, cause the ratio is 1x2
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> height is also different
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> 3 pixels is the difference
16:30 < Oy> https://imgur.com/a/XkmBjd4
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Meh how to compile teeworlds on windows xd
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it somehow doesnt find SDL.h but it works find for ddnet i guess ddnet uses some cmake magic and submodules. Do i have to put the SDL.h file manually in some MinGW include folder? And if yes which version of sdl?
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yea with deco from the tee its the same... but i looks odd without, the flag does not need to be so big
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> it does
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @Chairn  https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12540
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> dont use the sdl version that is liked there... use sdl 2.0.8 or 2.0.7
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> else why display it
16:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ty @Fisico
16:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> meh just downloaded 2.0.9
16:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> you get weird lagspikes with it ðŸ˜„
16:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh the instruction is for vs
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yes
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> some flags look similar already, making them smaller (loss in detail) will make em more confusional
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> visual studio community edition is use
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ah ok
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i really dislike vs ima keep trying with mingw
16:43 < rand> @ChillerDragon: you can try https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1730
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea i know but i want to use the system that is designed for master. If that pr doesnt get merged it might break in the future
16:47 < rand> as you wish
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what freetype version should i use?
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> you can use the one in the post ðŸ˜„
16:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh ty c:
16:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> meh but it doesnt have a lib folder
16:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i should... got mine from that link
16:50 < Oy> having a minimum height for the scoreboard might be a good idea
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea it has a win32 folder i just used the content for lib but now sdl seems to have some undefined reference errors

16:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> oy, maybe set the height to the max playerslots?
16:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> for example a server has 16 slots and 8 spectator slots... show 4 rows at the scoreboard
16:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> then you also see, when you reached the max playerslots, cause than the scoreboard is full
16:57 < Oy> Chillerdragon bam -c all and then try again
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> already did that
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> same result
16:58 < Oy> sth is off with the sdl lib
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is it maybe version 2.0.9 that makes the trouble
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i didnt find another one on libsdl.org
16:59 < Oy> Fisico players could also be in one team and dm - just some bigger minimum size might be enough
17:00 < redix> setting sv_player_slots at startup does not work anymore

17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> Server max players 16, spectatorslots 0, gametype teamâ€¦ = 8 lines.
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> Server max players 16, spectatorslots 8, gametype team.. = 4 lines.
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> Server max players 16, spectatorslots 6, gametype noneteam = 10 lines.
17:02 < Oy> team balance is adjustable
17:03 < Oy> hm should add checks to rcon commands set_team and set_team_all lets you have more than 16 players
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oy yay that worked. It was actually the problem with 9 instead of 8. Good to know.
17:04 < Oy> hm did they change the sdl functions?
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> looks like they changed 20+ functions
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> that were used in tw
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> 2.0.9 also has this weird fps bugs

19:47 <@Dune> whoops, thanks
19:50 < Oy> heinrich5991: are you around?
19:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ddint see him in days
19:53 < ChillerDragon> Oy what do you need?
19:54 < Oy> mac release :D
19:54 < Oy> that cmake stuff looks like it needs to be updated? has a list of files
19:55 < ChillerDragon> I can try a mac release if you want
19:55 < ChillerDragon> Yea i made a pr on heinrichs fork some days ago with some mac fixings but he is not around :c
19:59 <@Dune> I can reach a mac if it is necessary
20:01 < Oy> ChillerDragon can u build a working mac app with the cmake stuff?
20:03 < ChillerDragon> Oy i never completly build a fully woking on but i think with the new storage update you made i should be able to do it
20:04 < ChillerDragon> if you support me a bit with git magic getting the cmake stuff from heinrich in the current master
20:05 <@Dune> can't you just pull teeworlds upstream
20:05 <@Dune> and build from that
20:05 < ChillerDragon> i need the cmake stuff from heinrichs pr
20:06 <@Dune> then just clone heinrich's stuff
20:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> why not clone his repository and try it?
20:06 <@Dune> ^
20:06 < ChillerDragon> yea lez go
20:07 <@Dune> git clone https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/ pr_cmake
20:07 <@Dune> ChillerDragon:
20:07 < ChillerDragon> ty
20:08 <@Dune> huh not sure if that works actually
20:08 <@Dune> you might still need "git checkout pr_cmake" afterwards
20:08 < ChillerDragon> repo not found i think i have to do the fetch thingy i always forget to get the pr
20:09 < ChillerDragon> but thats fine i can do my changes manually agian
20:09 <@Dune> what
20:09 <@Dune> just  git clone https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/
20:09 < ChillerDragon> but how do i update heinrichs fork to upstream master
20:09 <@Dune> that won't make a repo not found
20:09 <@Dune> don't try to do complicated git stuff for now
20:09 <@Dune> just clone
20:09 < ChillerDragon> or i appended pr_cmake to the url xd nvm ye i am clonign normal now
20:10 <@Dune> now "git checkout pr_cmake"
20:10 < ChillerDragon> yea but this is outdated
20:10 <@Dune> do this then apply your changes
20:10 < ChillerDragon> and then?
20:11 <@Dune> pull upstream like this:
20:11 <@Dune> git pull https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/ master
20:12 < ChillerDragon> yuk conflicts
20:12 <@Dune> blergh
20:12 <@Dune> doesn't sound good to do this stuff for a release when you're not sure what you're doing
20:12 <@Dune> any other way than that, oy?
20:13 < ChillerDragon> well i can solve that conflicts
20:13 < ChillerDragon> i assume we go with 0.7.1
20:13 <@Dune> yeah but that's risky
20:14 <@Dune> i'd rather not risk that
20:14 < rand> oO
20:14 < rand> should be ok, the conflict is on version.h
20:14 < Learath2> What are you stuck on?
20:14 < ChillerDragon> u can solve teh conflicts aswell
20:15 < ChillerDragon> its only version.h
20:16 < ChillerDragon> well i dont think we are stuck but Dune is scared i mess something up
20:17 <@Dune> even if it works we need official binaries compiled by heinrich5991 with a script iirc
20:17 <@Dune> eh, not sure how mac works
20:17 <@Dune> does that cmake thing compile the whole app?
20:17 < ChillerDragon> no the pr works fine it replaces the scripts
20:17 < ChillerDragon> yes 
20:17 < rand> change version in the same way in version.h
20:18 < rand> and test the release :3
20:18 < ChillerDragon> if you dont trust me feel free to solve the conflict your self before i do it
20:18 <@Dune> you know what ChillerDragon, do the merge, then push that so we can check?
20:18 < ChillerDragon> that sounds useless complicated
20:18 <@Dune> git push origin master
20:19 <@Dune> not too complicated
20:19 < ChillerDragon> Oy would be awesome if you could simple solve the conflict in heinrichs pr real quick
20:20 < rand> Dune: I don't get it, the conflict hold on one line in one file, chillerdragon will do fine ^^
20:20 < ChillerDragon> well i tend to fuck up things im fine if some real tw dev wants to do it
20:20 <@Dune> alright
20:21 < Learath2> real tw dev? please
20:21 < Oy> resolved the conflict
20:21 < ChillerDragon> ty
20:21 < rand> that won't work
20:21 < ChillerDragon> what why?
20:22 < rand> Cmake use some regex to find the version from version.h
20:22 < ChillerDragon> Learath2 it is a fact that i am the newbie here i lack a lot of expierience
20:22 < Oy> oh
20:22 < ChillerDragon> ouch
20:22 < Learath2> You are good enough to merge version.h imho :D
20:23 < redix> What about this one
20:23 < ChillerDragon> ty xd
20:23 < redix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1691
20:23 < rand> unless it uses GAME_VERSION instead of GAME_RELEASE_VERSION
20:23 < rand> not sure about it
20:23 < Learath2> redix: nooo, that's way too radical
20:24 < redix> Okay :D
20:24 < rand> erf, it uses GAME_RELEASE_VERSION
20:26 < ChillerDragon> so?
20:27 < Oy> try
20:31 < ChillerDragon> as expected couldnt parse version
20:31 < ChillerDragon> i sux at regex but i can try
20:32 < rand> try replace Â« REGEX GAME_RELEASE_VERSION Â» with Â« REGEX "GAME_VERSION " Â»
20:32 < ChillerDragon> is this the new official format? SO the regex has to be updated anyways i guess?
20:32 < Learath2> The should be fine to parse "0.7.1" you sure you pulled before trying?
20:33 < Learath2> The regex*
20:33 < ChillerDragon> i pulled the tw/tw upstream
20:33 < rand> the issue is the line the regex is applied on
20:33 < Oy> changed that in the pr
20:34 < Learath2> ChillerDragon: check your version.h, I think you just didn't pull after oy fixed it :P
20:34 < rand> file list is not complete
20:34 < ChillerDragon> i pulled after oy fixed
20:34 < rand> Learath2: no, the regex won't work
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/518872753596661760/Bildschirmfoto_2018-12-02_um_20.34.50.png
20:35 < Oy> do u have to fix the file list manually?
20:35 < ChillerDragon> the other regex doesnt work rand
20:35 < Oy> there's another commit already
20:35 < rand> it works for me
20:35 < ChillerDragon> oh another one?
20:35 < Learath2> Oy: you can also use a glob but cmake suggests you list them all instead
20:35 < ChillerDragon> oh sowwy missed that
20:35 < Oy> oh ok
20:36 < ChillerDragon> how do i get that commit?
20:36 < ChillerDragon> oh okay now it works
20:36 < ChillerDragon> moment of truth im building the dmg
20:37  * rand expecting sur1.map and some assets related messages
20:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> woops forgot to apply my fixes sec
20:40 < ChillerDragon> meh ok the ressources path is still broken
20:40 < ChillerDragon> Oy your storage fix looked so promising
20:42 < ChillerDragon> [5c04356c][storage]: added path '$CURRENTDIR' ('/Users/chillerdragon/Desktop')
20:42 < ChillerDragon> should be [5c04356c][storage]: added path '$CURRENTDIR' ('/Users/chillerdragon/Desktop/teeworlds.app/Contents/Resources')
20:42 < Oy> ChillerDragon: did u mount the app and then started from that folder on the desktop?
20:43 < ChillerDragon> ye
20:46 < Oy> did u start the app or the executable that is within the app (teeworlds.app/Contents/MacOs/teeworlds)?
20:46 < ChillerDragon> i started the app by double clicking and then via terminal to get the console output
20:47 < Oy> both times no datadir?
20:47 < ChillerDragon> i dont see the CURRENTDIR and the console dialog if i normally launch it from the gui
20:47 < ChillerDragon> but the graphics were broken so i assume the exact same happend
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> does someone know what it takes to be an apple zertified developer? cause i cant start tw on my mac cause of this..
20:48 < Learath2> It takes a 100$s (source: am a apple certified (ios) developer)
20:49 < Learath2> But you don't need a developer certificate to run software on your mac anyways :P
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> oh ok
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yea but i looks bad with the error, and the user have to accept it in gatekeeper
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> learath2 you are not able to compile it with your account?
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Oy: are we releasing 0.7.1 soon?
20:51 < Learath2> I have a company account :P
20:51 < Oy> LordSk it's ready to be released
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> can we wait a week or so, to test thoroughly for bugs
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> maybe release a preview version on the forums
20:54 < Oy> what else do u want to test?
20:54 <@Dune> it's true we found some serious bugs in the last few days, I don't see this stopping immediately
20:55 < Oy> well, mostly caused by adding 64 player support
20:55 <@Dune> we could freeze the code
20:55 <@Dune> and release a bit later
20:55 <@Dune> like, no more features or changes, idk
20:55 < Oy> yeah, could do that
20:55 < Oy> but i'm pretty busy starting tuesday for 2 weeks
20:56 <@Dune> hmm :/
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> so release after the 2weeks?
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> for holiday season ðŸ˜„
20:57 <@Dune> maybe? sounds a bit much to me
20:57 <@Dune> I don't know
20:57 < ChillerDragon> i did it
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> the things is, there are very few people who actually test the 0.7 version
20:58 < ChillerDragon> give some time to clean up my hacky test codes and debug trash but i can provide a fully working apple release today
20:58 < rand> ChillerDragon: \o/
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yea 0.7.1 will take a while to get downloaded an played
20:59 < Oy> yeah, there aren't many people testing, but dunno if the number of testers will increase
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> maybe release on tw.com, github and wait a few days with steam?
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah ok that could work @Fisico
21:01 < Learath2> Well could get the release ready and it wouldn't take much time for you to release it even in a busy week
21:01 <@Dune> there could be a release candidate on the forum
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> we won't get people playing if we don't release anything anyway
21:01 <@Dune> but yeah I wonder how much Oy's time it would take to perform the release
21:02 < rand> +1 for the rc
21:02 < Oy> don't need me to actually release it. just create the releases, add the downloads, write a forum post
21:03 <@Dune> need minus for the version server I assume
21:03 < Oy> yeah
21:03 <@Dune> and masterserver (?)
21:03 <@Dune> but yeah we only need the greenlight
21:03 < Oy> nothing to do about them
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i dont think a rc will work... players will maybe download, start, see no players and leave again
21:04 < ChillerDragon> Oy do you want me to pr the fix and then reclone from master and rebuild or just send you the working app compiled from my fix code with wrong indentation and stuff xd
21:04 < ChillerDragon> well who cares about c++ indentations in binarys
21:05 < Oy> does the binary work?
21:05 < ChillerDragon> yes
21:05 < Oy> the app i mean
21:05 < ChillerDragon> yes
21:05 < Oy> maybe someone else with a mac could test it
21:05 < ChillerDragon> ah nvm i broke it agian
21:05 < ChillerDragon> xd
21:05 < ChillerDragon> sec
21:05 < Oy> to make sure it doesn't just work for u
21:06 < Learath2> I can test when you are done
21:06 < ChillerDragon> i can test on my moms mac aswell
21:07 < Oy> well i can to a rc on github for now
21:07 < Oy> *do
21:07 < ChillerDragon> nvm i broke something and cant reproduce it -.-
21:08 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy tagged 0.7.1-rc at master: https://git.io/fpKgn
21:12 < ChillerDragon> ah now i realized what happend. Sorry i got confused after upacking the 20th app. It only worked from terminal. I keep investigating but i cant promise a working result today
21:13 < Learath2> Only working from terminal smells a whole lot like a storage.cfg issue
21:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye sure it is a storage issue
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i assumed that weeks ago
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well was probably 1 week xd
21:14 < Learath2> ChillerDragon: does the ddnet dmg work for you btw?
21:14 < ChillerDragon> ye that one is different
21:15 < ChillerDragon> same as tw 0.6
21:15 < ChillerDragon> the $CURRENTDIR var is set correctly there
21:15 < ChillerDragon> i wish i could launch a terminal in the normal app double click mode
21:15 < ChillerDragon> like on windows
21:20 < Learath2> ChillerDragon: well you could check how we do it and port it over to 0.7
21:20 < Oy> currentdir isn't where it looks for data
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> had a similar problem with my linux server...
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1643
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i think heinrich did that already
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well i didnt run out of ideas yet im trying some stuff
21:27 < Oy> Chillerdrogon could you try the 0.6 app and paste the paths?
21:27 <@Dune> so we'd need a release candidate compiled for window,s linux, and if possible mac
21:27 <@Dune> sources already there
21:27 < Oy> added win32 and win64
21:27 <@Dune> aight
21:28 < Oy> for linux 64 i would need to reboot, dont wanna use the pi one - unless someone else can provide it ;)
21:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oy the problem is i cant launch a terminal if i double click the app so i have to start the binary inside the app but in 0.6 the CURRENTDIR points to the ressourcs folder if i launch it from the terminal
21:28 < Oy> need the other paths
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> those re the same if i remmber correctly
21:29 < Oy> then yeah do it with the terminal
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i deleted all 0.6 but i have a screensomewhere lemme check
21:29 < Oy> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=downloads&id=12543
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/356429946371047435/516721540209967105/Bildschirmfoto_2018-11-26_um_22.06.48.png
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 0.6.5
21:30 < Oy> ok
21:34 < rand> https://ptpb.pw/CM-w.tar.gz for linux x86_64
21:34 < Learath2> faster then me :P
21:38 < rand> https://ptpb.pw/BqHV.tar.gz for linux_x86
21:40 < rand> oh, i forgot the -rcâ€¦
21:42 < rand> https://ptpb.pw/bCMS (x86_64) and https://ptpb.pw/T1Wn (x86) then
21:43 < Oy> ok
21:46 < Oy> oh
21:47 < Oy> dunno what the mac problem is
21:47 < Oy> that client.m is gone, can't remember why
21:58 < Oy> linux dl's up as well
22:03 <@Dune> nice
22:09 < Oy> maybe should do some forum post?
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rly without mac version :c
22:10 < Oy> do u have a working one?
22:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no that was fake news onlyone that works from terminal and i am pretty stuck currently i run out of ideas
22:39 < ChillerDragon> ok i hacked soemthing together
22:39 < ChillerDragon> it is very dirty but working i guess
22:42 <@Dune> maybe as unofficial binaries for the RC
22:42 < ChillerDragon> btw what is an RC agian?
22:43 < rand> release candidate
22:43 < ChillerDragon> ah ye
22:43 < ChillerDragon> Learath2 and other mac users pls test https://ufile.io/4znjw
22:48 < ChillerDragon> a cleaner version without my debug messages https://ufile.io/b22hk
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Hmm seems like it is not working onmy moms imac because the library is not found
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it is funny that it says ddnet app in the crash report
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://pastebin.com/d4AjchVN
22:58 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1730/files#diff-96388f315c8e4688f8ba2ccdc0158d2dR20
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y that one xd
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> pro
23:06 < ChillerDragon> Ah i think i found the issue. But i need the lib files for sdl
23:06 < ChillerDragon> 0.6 had a different sdl version i guess so i cant use that one
23:13 <@Dune> aight so I'll make the RC post without mac then :)
23:14 <@Dune> blog or news?
23:15 < minus> So, only cheese?
23:16 <@Dune> :)
23:17 < ChillerDragon> im slowly progressing i fixed the freetype thing now it fails on libwav -.-
23:17 < ChillerDragon> sdl not freetype*
23:22 < ChillerDragon> i dont get it. since when is libwav a trouble maker is this new?
23:25 < Oy> Dune: either way is fine
23:27 < ChillerDragon> Oy is there something new with the sound? Or is libwav related to sdl? I dont get why it is running on my laptop but not on my mothers imac.
23:30 < Oy> no idea
23:31 < Oy> maybe some dependency of sdl?
23:46 < ChillerDragon> yea maybe
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the weird thing is that the error dialog on the imac says Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/wavpack/lib/libwavpack.1.dylib
23:47 < ChillerDragon> but on my laptop the app works and this path doesnt exsist here either
