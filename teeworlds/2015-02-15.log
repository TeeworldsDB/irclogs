09:42 < JulianAssange> who the hell is botnik 
09:42 < JulianAssange> who owns it
09:46 <@matricks> good morning, ready to repent your sins?
09:46 < JulianAssange> it's 8pm
09:46 <@matricks> it almost 10am here
10:56 <@minus> morn o/
10:57 < rayv> o/
10:58 < LittleWhite> Morning Minus :)

11:00 <@minus> not yet
11:00  * minus np: coda - Megabits per Second
11:01 < LittleWhite> I have a question about teeworlds dev
11:01 < LittleWhite> :$
11:02 < LittleWhite> is the dev still ongoing ? What is the general situation and what are the objectives ?
11:03 < LittleWhite> Will the pullrequests will be integrated ? (Like SDL 2, is not a bad thing, no ? )
11:06 <@minus> yes. very slow progress. yes, i guess (some time)
11:07 < LittleWhite> I was wondering, since, keeping SDL 1 stuff, could assure compatibility on very old machines (like Amiga ? )
11:07 <@matricks> erh... amiga doesn't have acceleration needed
11:07 <@minus> does tw run on amiga?
11:08 < LittleWhite> I don't think so ... but as far as I remember, teeworlds needs only SDL 1 / OpenGL 1, right ?
11:08 <@minus> yes
11:09 <@matricks> yes, but not moving to SDL2 just to keep support for amiga is.. well.. not worth it
11:09 < LittleWhite> :D
11:09 < LittleWhite> and for old PCs ?
11:09 <@matricks> SDL2 will still support
11:09 < LittleWhite> really old configuration, not having more than OpenGL 1 (normally, I guess, it does not exists anymore)
11:09 <@matricks> windows doesn't "support" more then opengl 1.2
11:10 < LittleWhite> I have a netbook (Acer Aspire stuff, with Intel Atom 1 ) and I can't run SDL 2
11:10 <@matricks> why not?
11:10 < LittleWhite> maybe I have to retry, but, SDL 2 did not want to init
11:10 <@matricks> strange
11:10 <@matricks> it should
11:10 <@minus> youtubes was too slow to play that video :(
11:10 < LittleWhite> I will retry with 2.0.3
11:10 <@minus> so i went ahead with this:
11:10 <@minus> youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZxPhDC-r3w -f141,299 && ffmpeg -i Intrinsic\ Gravity\ by\ Still--ZxPhDC-r3w.m4a -i Intrinsic\ Gravity\ by\ Still--ZxPhDC-r3w.mp4 -c:v copy -c:a copy Intrinsic\ Gravity\ by\ Still--ZxPhDC-r3w.mkv && rm Intrinsic\ Gravity\ by\ Still--ZxPhDC-r3w.m4a Intrinsic\ Gravity\ by\ Still--ZxPhDC-r3w.mp4

11:11 < EastByte> minus: that's the way I normally do it :P
11:11 <@matricks> livestreamer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZxPhDC-r3w best
11:11 < Nimda3> [YouTube] Title: Intrinsic Gravity by Still | Rating: 4.97/5.00 | Views: 29,970
11:11 <@minus> EastByte: finding out the best formats is extra work though :(
11:11 <@matricks> easier
11:12 <@minus> does livestreamer get the 1080p60 DASH video?
11:12 <@matricks> doesn't look like it
11:12 <@matricks> :/
11:12 <@minus> youtube-dl -f best just gets 720p 
11:12 <@matricks> same with live streamer it seems
11:13 <@minus> 1080p looks better :>
11:13 <@minus> so sharp
11:13 < EastByte> both streams need to be downloaded/merged at the same time
11:13 < EastByte> any way to do that?
11:13 <@minus> nvm, full of artifacts now
11:13 <@minus> compressed to death
11:14 <@minus> you could feed both URLs to your media player
11:14 <@matricks> or.. well, if you have windows
11:14 <@matricks> http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=64756
11:14 <@minus> mpv <video url> --audio-file <audio url>
11:14 < EastByte> hm well
11:14  * matricks goes back to some gamin'
11:14  * EastByte goes back to codin'
11:15 <@minus> is some nice 1bit demo
11:16 <@minus> oh, there come more bits
11:16 < JulianAs1ange> http://crimefeed.com/2015/02/christina-lorena-reber/
11:17 < JulianAs1ange> nsf..l?
11:17 <@minus> then don't post it
11:26 <@matricks> JulianAs1ange: ffs
11:26 <@matricks> JulianAs1ange: learn what to post in what channels
11:32 < JulianAs1ange> im so sry
11:33 < JulianAssange> does anybody know a good way to choose what interface to use, in a shell?
11:33 < JulianAssange> e.g. i have eth0, eth0:1, eth0:2, etc., but I want to use eth0:1 for a certain process
11:34 <@minus> possible, but requires some amount of hacking
11:34 < JulianAssange> there's no nice program to run? 
11:34 <@minus> if your program can bind to an ip address you just need an `ip rule` and a new routing table
11:35 < JulianAssange> yes
11:35 <@minus> if you can't bind it you can pull some trick with iptables
11:35 < JulianAssange> it's irssi though
11:36 <@minus> i've achieved that, but, hell, it ain't easy
11:36 < JulianAssange> oh
11:37 < JulianAssange> it's easy 
11:37 < JulianAssange> . /set hostname IP
11:37 <@minus> so it supports binding
11:37 < JulianAssange> yeah
11:37 < JulianAssange> didn't know that
11:39 < JulianAssange> it even works for hostnames
11:40 < JulianAssange> but mine didn't become of cloudflare: Unable to connect server irc.quakenet.org port 6667 [Cannot assign requested address: 104.28.31.119]
11:41 <@minus> huh
11:41 <@minus> are you trying to bind to a cloudflare IP?
11:42 < JulianAssange> nah, i did /set hostname internot.info
11:42 < JulianAssange> but internot.info is a cloudflare ip
11:42 < JulianAssange> i forgot
13:08 < JulianAssange> what
13:08 <@minus> what what
13:08 <@matricks> what what what
13:09 < JulianAssange> nvm
13:09 < JulianAssange> Warning: Configuration file was modified while irssi was running. Saving configuration to file '/home/ircu/.irssi/config.autosave' instead. Use /SAVE or /RELOAD to get rid of this message.
13:09 < JulianAssange> thought it was an irc message, not system
13:16 <@minus> damn, "DataManager" - that's gotta be the most generic name ever
13:18 < JulianAssange> what about NetworkManager?
22:06 < heinrich5991> matricks: why does the code stop predicting if it's one second behind?
22:07 < heinrich5991> performance?
22:07 <@minus> because it'd be pointless?
22:07 <@minus> ^^
22:08 < heinrich5991> minus: currently it extrapolates linearly after that one second, not sure if that makes more sense :)
22:09 <@matricks> heinrich5991: it's a bit of both
22:09 <@matricks> performance and memory
22:10 <@matricks> could probably be longer but if you have spikes of 1 sec.. well
22:10 <@matricks> it's pretty much unplayable so
