03:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> don't we have a separate race timer now
03:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> Gamestarttick is always used as a reference for synced envelope even in DDNet iirc. Otherwise inf's class selection won't work.
03:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> DDNet might have some special case handled in client for race type.
03:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> So maybe use the race timer in 0.7
05:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @fokkonaut I don't thin ddnet uses the gamestarttick for the race timer
05:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> for ddnet clients
07:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @TsFreddie i cant use the race timer because my mod displays scores, not times. Optionally, I do have /score time which shows score as time, and that is the only point where i use the race flag
08:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you could theoretically show the time as broadcast instead
08:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think ddnet does that on clients that don't support race time
08:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> wont work either, broadcast is commonly used as an xp message in my mod xD
08:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> seems like im not getting synced envelopes for 0.7 xd But i really wonder why ddnet client doesnt care about the gamestarttick, seems like it only receives it onces then never looks back at it again
08:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> check the source ^^
08:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you can stack broadcasts ^^
08:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think that's what some mod of chillerdragon does
08:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Nope, xp message is 3 lines already xD
08:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> and that's max size?
08:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> im 0.7
08:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
08:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in*
08:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I guess you could not show the race time while you have a three-line xp message
08:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> other than that, I'm out of ideas
08:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yea okay that would be a possibility xD
08:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But its too weirs I think, so I will just not use a day/night cycle i guess
08:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I wish 0.7 had the same handling of envelopes
08:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Seems generally stupid to always rely on the gamestarttick
08:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> means also that envelops reset when the game restarts (Vanilla)
08:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Like ddnet does it makes the most sense i think
08:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Because it seems like they fetch the gamestarttick once after joining and then always rely on that one
08:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Then we could make sure its always synced between all clients, as it is not right now if ab client gets a modified start tick (0.7 only)
11:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Um, ddnet synced envelopes have been broken since forever
11:02 < ChillerDragon> +1
11:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 wdym? I think we fixed them with the teeuniverse thing
11:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I think the teeuniverse thing broke them
11:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think the teeuniverse thing made it so they behave like in vanilla
11:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> i.e. synced means based on server time, not race time
11:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (which also stops the flickering when you stand on the start)
11:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (previously, it was based on server time until you start your race)
11:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Ah I remember, there is no way to sync to race time now
11:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
11:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> That's why the mappers were complaining
11:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (which is a good thing IMO, because it doesn't make sense to flicker graphics at start)
11:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (and there's no way to fix the flickering, at least as far as I can see, because there's no way to ensure a smooth transition)
11:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> We can lerp every value to the beginning :P
11:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> lerp?
11:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Linear interp
11:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> â€¦
11:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Would look funny tho :P
11:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> or we can omit this flawed concept. yes, probably
11:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> know a program that can import/export audio metadata to csv?
11:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Maybe envelopes synced to race time could be paused till start?
11:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if you hit the start line again, they'd have to reset
11:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Mh. It did allow some interesting maps tho
11:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> > How to convert an audio file to a csv file - Quora
11:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> wtf
11:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Quora has everything, even if the question doesnt make sense
11:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Wym by audio metadata @heinrich5991? Each container has their own way of storing metadata
11:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Some dont even store any metadata
11:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in my case flac, but doesn't hurt to support other formats as well
11:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Hm, I can't think if any tool. But I bet there is a python package to read the metadata
11:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Python has everything :P
11:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Python pefile reads PE files better than any PE explorer out there
11:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> does python has a svg2ttf thing
11:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, `mutagen` supports all audio formats
11:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I just pondered whether I need to write my own csv to/from audio metadata script or not

11:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> this is a plus for the comparison of tools for linux; does that mean the other tools don't work properly? ^^
11:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> : eyes :
11:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> also gold:

11:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I guess I'm writing my own
12:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> : smile :
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> can we get that in vanilla 0.7?
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think vanilla has that(?)
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it doesn't base the animations on the race time AFAIK
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> he changed gamestarttick
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> well, this is his fault ^^
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> and can't use race time for some reason
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 how is it my fault if it works different in tw than in ddnet?
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> obviously false, 0.7 bases on the gamestarttick, but at ALL TIME, ddnet somehow fetches the start tick while joining, then never looks back at it
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so, the animation is always good for ddnet clients, but for 0.7 it gets out of sync if the gamestarttick changes for them, so if i dont pass the startline (gamestarttick is normal) then it also works there
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> why does the 0.7 client has to always check the gamestarttick? where is the sense
14:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I bet it's just accidental that ddnet doesn't continue to check that
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But it makes sense
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> not sure
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what happens when a new round starts?
