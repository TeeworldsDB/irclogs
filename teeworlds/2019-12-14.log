00:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it saays buy python3.7
00:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> bru
00:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol
00:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> last time i compiled python my self was a mess
00:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might try to run this with 2.x on your ubbuntu machine
00:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> thats best i can get with debian9
00:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> try python3 main.py
00:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i did
00:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol
00:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> have fun rmeoving current syntax ._.
00:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> removing
00:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> bru
00:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> bra
00:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD I don't know why it doesn't work
00:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> of, did you read teh readme
00:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there is vpn stuff in there as well
00:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wat readme
00:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ist that running the discord bot by itself or is that copy and pasting some of my stuff?
00:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, file looks like yours
00:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> weird shiet
00:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/chillavanilla/TeeworldsEconMod/blob/master/tools/tw_api_empty.py
00:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im running this which is tw_api.py from vanilla master without master
00:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> try reverting the last change :D?
00:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> of the tw api
00:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe that helps, kinda doubt it, but gotta try
00:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> where deen changed the first line
00:23 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well executing it with python3 should bypass the shebang
00:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'd guess :'c
08:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> `f""` strings are a new addition
08:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> python 3.6
09:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But the f string is used in a error message so something before fails already :/
11:14 < Oy> how about a visual gimmick for the future: when playing a race gametype the tee wears race shoes? :)
11:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yikes
11:33 < Oy> @Zatline love that bumbler skin :)
12:02 < Dune> ho the two big prs are in
12:09 < Dune> good thing the gametype match is not case sensitive for icons
12:09 < Dune> race tends to use lowercase
12:13 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2193 can be closed
12:17 < Dune> how about some space between callvote and browser in the gui?
12:18 < Dune> local and global options were separated and I liked that
12:18 < Dune> of course we can't eat up too much space on the left because locales have a hard time translating server info :/
12:18 < Dune> ideally a browser icon would be nice :p
12:27 < Oy> yeah more icons for the headers would be nice
12:29 < Oy> dunno if more space would look odd
12:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune>

12:34 < Oy> just need a browser icon :D
12:34 < Dune> the font doesn't support it :p
12:34  * Dune waves at @Sonix
12:34 < Oy> oh :D
12:34 < Dune> err, bridge didn't like it. *waves at @Sonix*
12:35 < Dune> https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f310/fontsupport.htm not too many fonts
12:38 < Dune> oy: build failing
12:38 < Dune>    int NewIndex = -1;
12:38 < Dune> ./root/project/src/game/client/components/menus.cpp:990:7: error: unused variable 'NewIndex' [-Werror=unused-variable]
12:47 < Oy> could replace settings with the symbol from the server browser
12:47 < Oy> makes up space
12:48 < Dune> yeah not sure if we should do that
13:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> we shouldn't use different buttons/displays on different interfaces, they should be even
13:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I agree with replacing settings ingame button with the symbol
13:15 < Dune> yeah we should do that too
13:15 < Dune> ah nvm read it wrong
13:15 < Dune> Hopefully people still find the settings button :)
13:16 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> getting a lot of those on linux btw
13:16 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/655382674214748220/unknown.png
13:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> window is opened at the right size, but the game still thinks it's on a 1920x1080 screen (my desktop size) when fullscreen'd
13:22 < Dune> it stays white on hover though
13:22 < Dune> when you use an icon instead of utf8 symbol
13:32 < Oy> do you have a high dpi screen?
13:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Which one is better:
13:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/511260449589821472/655383343134670858/screenshot_2019-12-14_12-19-08.png

13:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> (Icon)
13:34 < Oy> vote for 1st
13:38 < Dune> no high dpi
13:39 < Dune> for experimentation: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/compare/master...Dune-jr:exp-extendedbrowser?expand=1
13:40 < Dune> the zoom in makes the name column tight on 4:3 resolutions, although I believe the expanded view (the arrow on the right) was engineered for this use case
13:40 < Dune> not sure if adaptative zoom in would be better
13:45 < Dune> about sonix's icons, I think both look equally good
13:50 < Oy> dunno if that's sdl or teeworlds causing that odd screen
13:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> never had this on other computers so its probably related to the distro or something
13:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> i don't play other games here so I can't tell
13:52 < Oy> maybe outdated sdl2 version?
13:53 < Oy> that reminds me: should check if sdl2.10 works on windows now
13:53 < Dune> ah right
13:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> libSDL2-2.0.so.0 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSDL2-2.0.so.0 (0x00007f9d6f565000)
13:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> 2.0.8+dfsg1-1ubuntu1.18.04.4
13:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> According to ddnet 2.0.10 has the same issues on windows like 2.0.9
13:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1997
14:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> @Oy happy to hear that ðŸ˜„

15:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the 0.7 generics have a lot of space at the corners
15:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> looks kinda ugly with shadows sometimes imo maybe we could need some shadows that only cover the corners on all sides i mean we have a full tileset only shadows now anyways
15:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> why not just put shadow layer below unhookable layer?
15:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> why not put shadow layer below unhookable layer?
15:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> because then you just move the problem somewhere else
15:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> iif you want no shadow above or bewlow the generic
15:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> at somepoint it will look odd then
17:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune i still dont have any servers in my master
17:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> serverlist.json is full tho
18:03 < Dune> you mean in your browser?
18:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
18:10 < Dune> favorites work?
18:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> havent tested
18:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and cant rn, mobile
18:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> one question about server-side stats (https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2255):
18:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> should it be realized with a netmsg that just initializes the stats and then the client tracks the stats itself
18:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> or should it use snapshots? advantage of snapshots would be that the server has more control over the stats and it would work in demos aswell. disadvantage would be more traffic, but thanks to delta, compression, etc. it shouldn't be that much
18:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> netmsgs might work for demos aswell, but it needs some more code ðŸ˜„
18:23 < Dune> good question
18:23 < Dune> the traffic seems somewhat unnecessary
18:23 < Dune> but if we want to implement some server-side stats we need snapshots I guess (speed, accuracy, wink @Sonix )
18:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> when nothing changes, the server won't send any data. otherwise it will just send the delta (+compression)
18:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> since these values dont change that much, this usually means one byte per field. after huffman even less
18:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> but you need to send all player stats to each other player
18:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> well i only thought about the fields currently supported by the statboard. avg. speed, accuracy (maybe even per weapon) would create even more traffic =\
18:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> well i only thought about the fields currently supported by the statboard. avg. speed, accuracy (maybe even per weapon), ... would create even more traffic =\
18:28 < Dune> not sure yeah, should ask Oy later
18:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> okay ðŸ™‚
18:42  * Dune dreams of UI hooks :<
18:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> 
18:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/655468258115190794/screenshot_2019-12-14_18-56-15.png
18:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> the bright eyes are a bit problematic in team based gamemodes =\
18:59 < Dune> huh @Zatline
18:59 < Dune> sounds like an annoying exploit
19:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> let the server handle all the stats
19:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's mod friendlier
20:56 < Dune> [teeworlds] <redix> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/655468258115190794/screenshot_2019-12-14_18-56-15.png
20:57 < Dune> some skins will need fixups
20:58 < Oy> oh
21:01 < Dune> still got a few things in my todo list
21:01 < Dune> https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/projects/2
21:01 < Dune> 2297 and 2242 especially
21:05 < Oy> translations need to be done before release, a week would be good i guess
21:05 < Oy> so can't any strings then
21:11 < Dune> nothing that I have planned requires strings
21:12 < Dune> are there open PRs requiring strings?
21:12 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2305 *removes* locales
21:12 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2314/files adds some
21:16 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> is automatic demo recording for races planned for vanilla or it will be for custom clients only?
21:18 < Dune> can't you already auto record races?
21:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> you can use the auto recording to record everything... but it would be cool to only record the race itself and keep the one with the best time
21:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> the implementation from the old 0.6 clients is a bit hacky, so i did not include it in the pr
21:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> yes thats what I meant
21:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> it was basically more a matter of time and motivation ^^
21:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Ye thats why I only asked if its planned, I guess its possible to make a non hacky solution now that race is supported in vanilla ^^
21:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> yeah the protocol now provides everything thats needed
21:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> :D
21:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> it's listed in the race issue
21:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> votes need to be reworked on a protocol level, I'd guess ._.?
21:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> in regard to #2242
21:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> yep. that at least need some slight changes
21:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> depending on how far you want to go, this might even be a breaking change =\
21:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think it's highly needed to work with ids
21:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> to identify every vote option
21:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if I'm not mistaken it's currently using the actual description string
21:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and if there are two equal strings, the first one is used?
21:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> not quite sure
21:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> yep
21:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe negative ids for whitespace
21:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dunno ._. ids should do
21:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> problem is that you still need to use the description for old clients since it's also used on network level
21:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <redix> so either you have quite a lot compatibility code or you do a breaking change =\
21:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> prefer breaking change telling people who try to join to update their client
21:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 0.7 is young and can handle that
21:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as there is a lot of stuff being done on the protocol level anyway(even tho most likely not compatibility breaking)
21:44 < Oy> i guess to fix that eye thing, there needs to be a black outline in the image
21:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> @Dune should be an easy fix in theory team colored tees should either just always use standard black eyes or more complicated but better maybe have an if condition that checks for contrast or a range of acceptable black shades.
21:53 < Dune> that sounds complicated
21:53 < Dune> not sure if enforcing standard eyes is a good solution...
21:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> yeah that I guessed
21:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> well I personally  don't like the way team colors are generated as a whole .. markings have a similar issue like the eyes they often get lost in the process
21:58 < Oy> it's not team colour specific, you can also create that skin for dm
22:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> my impresssion is that the way 0.6 generated it's team color counterparts was working way better in preserving markings and details
22:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> most simple way to fix it I guess would be to have a condition that when "negative" eyes are selected then the team colored tee uses "dark grey" instead
22:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> most simple way to fix it I guess would be to have a condition that when "negative" eyes are selected then the team colored tee uses "colorable" instead
22:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> most simple way to fix it I guess would be to have a condition that when "negative" white eyes are selected then the team colored tee uses "colorable" dark grey instead
22:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> serverside pls
22:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> modding has to be a part of tw
22:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> we shouldnt force too much
22:09 < Dune> if you want the client to see a differnet KD, you can mod the killmessages
22:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> We could treat the eyes differently so that they don't get colored
22:14 < Dune> oh, never thought of that
22:17 < Oy> doesn't matter, already tried
22:17 < Oy> when the body is similar you have that problem, same for non-team gametypes when the body colour is similar
22:18 < Oy> standard eyes are pretty save cause u can't make a black body, rest isn't
22:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Do we have non black/white colored eyes right now?
22:18 < Oy> no
22:19 < Oy> you couldn't colorize eyes yet
22:19 < Dune> I saw some weird things because of your zomb eyes @LordSk
22:19 < Dune> your zomb skins are popular and some people changed the eye color iirc
22:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> What I mean to say, if someone really wants its own skin to have red eyes on a red body, why forbid it?
22:20 < Dune> because everyone else will see it?
22:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> As long as default eyes are working as intended it should be fine right?
22:21 < Dune> if we force default eyes I agree, but then what's the point of eyes parts
22:21 < Oy> yeah
22:24 < Oy> like i mentioned if the eyes have an outline, that you can't colorize, would fix it in general
22:24 < Dune> hmm what do you think of that, @zatline ?
22:25 < Oy> probably have to test how it looks
22:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> 
22:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/655522030124400683/unknown.png
22:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> So we have 4 default eye types now
22:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> One is colorable
22:31 < Dune> the first one is a bit as well
22:31 < Oy> first 2 are yeah, they're new
22:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> We could force black as a color for team based?
22:31 < Dune> but you have the same problem in non-team
22:31 < Dune> you can color your tee red
22:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hm.
22:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> So I guess there is no way around it
22:35 < Dune> either standard eye parts have to meet good defaults or we mitigate the eye colors so it can only be slightly different than black
22:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> or we compare body and eye color, adjust it towards black if they are too close
22:37 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and only do this for default eyes
22:37 < Dune> non-default*
22:37 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I mean default as the 4 we have now
22:37 < Dune> why wouldn't you do it for other eyes?
22:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> what if I have cool white outlined eyes, and I want red eyes on a red body
22:39 < Dune> then just like dark skins: you don't
22:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> except I would be the only one seeing my own custom eyes right?
22:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> where is the harm in that
22:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> whgy are there even 4 eyes? I always had 3 eye types when I was deving the new skins ðŸ˜„
22:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> *why
22:41 < Dune> lordsk got custom skins maybe?
22:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Hum let me check
22:41 < Oy> there are 2 default eyes which are similar
22:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> yea cuz there really only should be 3 options
22:42 < Oy> just the distance between the eyes is a bit bigger i guess
22:42 < Oy> u barely notice
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> black, dark grey and negative
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> 
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/655524983426252800/unknown.png
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> standaardreal can get removed
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Zatline> it's just black with the gaps that nobody liked
22:45 < Oy> alright
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> Oy btw. I think I may have to make another PR cuz during my work I changed some small details on some of the older skins that I totaly forgot about including in the PR  .. and some of the old skins if I remember had inconsistant body outline values as well.
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you could add a dot in the middle and have a pupil
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> one example: limekitty skin used to have lime colored eyes in 0.6 and in 0.7 they became pure black which for me ruined that skin I changed that back to the orignal look
22:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> which btw. actually kicked of me indroducing colorable eyes in the first place lel
22:57 < Dune> I see no good solution for that though
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> and it worked just fine back then, if I would make the eyes the same color now in 0.7 eyes would most likely get lost when team color is applied
23:09 < Dune> then make eyes non custom colorable? that sounds reasonable
23:10 < Dune> isnt there a flag in the json for that
23:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes
23:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> so u mean eliminate eyes color option ingame and just preserve it in the json?
23:23 < Dune> yes
23:23 < Dune> at least with default skins
23:23 < Dune> unless you design eyes with an outline such that it is reasonable to allow custom colors
23:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> can I share file over here?
23:28 < Dune> yes
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> try this as overlay layer for team

23:30 < Dune> team is no different than no-team
23:30 < Dune> this layer should always be applied
23:30 < Dune> (to problematic eyes)
23:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> okay then try that
23:31 < Dune> probably better to directly patch the eyes
23:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> hmm but I'm not really sure if I like  the concept tho normal eyes were never suposed to have outlines :/
23:34 < Dune> then apply my proposed solution: make such eyes not customisable
23:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> only in json I'd be okay with that
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> but note this is only making it slightly harder but the exploit would still exist and the way the mouse looks on teams doesn't really change either unless giving it more darker eyes
23:39 < Dune> no, this would fix the exploit, as you wouldn't see *others* with such skins
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> but what about default skins like the panther and new mouse that have colored eyes as well as old limekitty that I'd like to reintroduce
23:42 < Dune> I guess you need new eyes for each of these
23:43 < Dune> hmmm, so we could allow custom colors for our skins, but forbid foreign skins with custom colors. as such, only "limekitty" can get green eyes. not sure if that is a pretty solution
23:44 < Dune> @LordSk might have a third solution with color detection
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> a well working color detection would be ideal I guess but also most complex sadly I'm aware that this would be not easy
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> okay outlining it could work doesn't look that bad but ...

23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> now the but! look at the markings they as well get totally lost when team color is applied
23:56 < Dune> that is another issue
23:56 < Dune> I'm not convinced the eyes are fine here
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> it's nature is the same!
23:57 < Dune> eyes probably should get colored black in team modes anyway
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> people complained the markings were too defined on team colors
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> this is tuneable
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the beaver needs teeth
