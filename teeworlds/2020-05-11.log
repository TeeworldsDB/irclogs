00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 should only perform worse on packet loss
00:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune tee's ofc
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> there should be no more custom colors option, the picker should be active always
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> because as i said its not custom anymore, since default skins also use "custom colors on", it doesnt make sense anymore, it only did before
08:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @heinrich5991 well there is obviously something slowing it down
11:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I am still working on the modding interface, what api Interfaces would you want to see?
12:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> What kind of modding are you working on? After spending a couple hours discussing this we kinda reached the conclusion that we should instead make teeworlds more moddable rather then introducing hooks and dynamically loading mods
12:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> `IGameController` not being an actual interface at all is a great place to start
12:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 did 128 players work well with snaps?
12:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well @fokkonaut says it worked well in 0.6, that's one of the obvious things that's different
12:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think it's just a convenient thing to blame
12:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> registration also works in 0.6 but not 0.7
12:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> do we see packet loss to these clients?
12:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well atleast I propose a theory
12:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
12:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> on a normal day on the internet, there's practically no packet loss AFAIK
12:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> why does the connection lag?
12:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> well I cba to profile it, it's not my project, you'll have to wait around for @fokkonaut to check what is actually going on
12:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if snaps go through, players should see no lagging, right?
12:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> at worst, they'll see bad player names
12:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> well he is probably using an O(n^2) algorithm to figure out what packets need to be sent
12:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> maybe the snaps themselves aren't getting generated fast enough?
13:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> > What kind of modding are you working on? After spending a couple hours discussing this we kinda reached the conclusion that we should instead make teeworlds more moddable rather then introducing hooks and dynamically loading mods
13:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Learath2 The hooks are interface based, and I am actually trying to get rid of the IGameController
13:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> For example the `DoWincheckMatch`-Function should be interfaced, because its very mod specific
13:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I was planning on reducing `IGameController` to an ABC that only is an interface for features that virtually all controllers need and split the implementation into two classes, one implementing the base functionality for all mods and the other doing things specific to the vanilla gamemodes
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It'd be really nice if while modding people didn't have to touch the game server so much, it's just not a good pattern, the game server should be deferring to the gamecontroller as much as possible in the most generic way possible
13:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I guess if I was going for a more dynamic approach, I'd just make the entire gamecontroller pluggable, a nice and clean interface boundary
