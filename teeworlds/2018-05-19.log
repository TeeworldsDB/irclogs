19:00 < Nils_> @matricks Why did my Avira Free Antivirus say that the "txt2x.exe" from bam is an Virus?
19:57 <@matricks> Nils_: where did you get it from?
20:07 < Nils_> http://github.com/downloads/matricks/bam/bam-0.4.0.zip
20:08 < Nils_> 13.05 at 14:15
20:30 <@matricks> Nils_: you compiled it yourself?
20:40 < Nils_> When I try, my antivirus program reports the virus in the txt2c.exe.
20:40 <@matricks> either false alarm, or your compiler is infected / faulty etc
20:41 <@matricks> does it say which virus it detects?
20:43 < Nils_> Yes, "HEUR/APC"
20:44 <@matricks> http://www.tomsguide.com/answers/id-2774263/false-positive.html
20:45 <@matricks> dunno what causes it to trigger
20:46 <@matricks> https://www.avira.com/en/support-threats-summary/tid/26757/threat/HEUR.APC
20:48 < Nils_> Hm.. http://www.tomsguide.com/answers/id-2774263/false-positive.html good Answer
20:50 < Nils_> Okay, thanks, I don't think it's a virus. Good night.
