13:47 <@Dune> sick motivation btw to continuously fix random unrewarding technical bugs for years straight :P
13:59 < ChillerDragon> well fixing bugs can give you some kick :D but ye good job
14:00 < ChillerDragon> we talk about oy right=
14:00 < ChillerDragon> also fan
14:07 < Oy> well others do crossword puzzles or sth :D
14:15 < Oy> about the time icon: checked our font, it doresn't have the utf8 clock chars so we probably need an image
14:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> should we get a license-compatible icon font
14:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> using from dejavu sans might break for ppl customizing the font.
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> using \*icons\* from *
14:54 <@Dune> yeah I don't know if font icons is the best way to go
15:15 < Oy> adding a font just for one icon would probably be too much
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> we might ended up adding more individual small images like the race timer and race flag instead of a spritesheet.
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think png icons are more reliable than using DejaVu's icons
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> so i think we need a dedicated icon font, either find one or build one. i would love to have a pipeline that builds svgs into ttf.
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> plus fonts can draw everything in one call.ðŸ˜‹
