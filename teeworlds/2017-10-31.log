00:05 <@heinrich5991> Befall193: the server looks good to me, no bots advertised in the server browser
00:12 < Befall193> heinrich5991: which client are you using. Can't reproduce it in vanilla. Only ddnet. So this is the wrong place. I'm sorry
00:14 <@heinrich5991> Befall193: I can't see it in ddnet either
00:51 <@heinrich5991> server is sending a player count of 0, but details the bot clients in the player tab
00:51 <@heinrich5991> doesn't seem harmful to me, unless harm is demonstrated, I'd let that pass
00:51 <@heinrich5991> you can tell that to Befall193 if they show up again
