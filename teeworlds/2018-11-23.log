17:26 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master c12ec26 oy: increased the alpha for not related tabs in the ingame menu
17:59 < Oy> Dune: how about like https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1611#issuecomment-440340212 your first picture and also the background between the top tab and the middle part(between settings and sound in the picture)?
17:59 < Oy> then it feels like a tab/it belongs together
18:04 < Oy> guess you don't need the higher alpha anymore with that black background
18:06 < Dune> huh
18:06  * Dune is raising alpha everywhere in menus_settings
18:08 < Dune> Well, I'll keep changing the alpha everywhere with proper variables
18:08 < Dune> At least if that has to be changed again it's easy
18:08 < Dune> but then you put that background in the offline menus too I assume Oy
18:10 < Oy> Dune: yeah, put the background everywhere to keep it consitent - it's also in the start menu already
18:13 < Dune> huh, alright
18:14 < Dune> I guess some things still need the alpha adjusted, like the start menu
18:15 < Dune> current state on my side: https://i.imgur.com/AiZ1NXb.png
18:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yea not bad
18:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> top row need to be a bit darker don't you think?
18:18 < Dune> yes, didn't do that yet @Fisico

18:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Oy: (hi) thoughts?
18:25 < Oy> looks good
18:25 < Oy> maybe some less alpha?
18:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok
18:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @Dune looks good
18:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @LordSk id is way to big ingame.. chat is ok
18:33 < rand> I'll try to work on >16 support to fill the missing features, do you think it could be had to 0.7.1 ? or this should wait ?
18:33 < Dune> 13 id not being aligned with the rest looks odd
18:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @oy the ingame menu is still a bit weird... if you click settings in the ingame menu and than hit esc than hit escape again you are still in the settings page...
18:34 < rand> in the later case, it could be nice to have the protocol handling well >16 so that 0.7 could support it without breaking compatibility
18:34 < Dune> @Fisico well, no reason to reset the menus as long as disconnect/join buttons are easily reachable?
18:35 < Dune> rand: but if the protocol supports >16 that means the client will crash on any server that uses >16?
18:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> that is very strange
18:35 < rand> will the suchitee scoreboard be merged for 0.7.1 ?
18:35 < Dune> it's on the milestone rand https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/milestone/8
18:35 < rand> Dune: no, the client will refuse to connect to them i guess
18:36 < rand> gotta work this we then :)
18:37 < rand> at least, it can be done this way (as an workaround)
18:37 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @Dune there is no reason to save the menu state... it is a horrible user experience if the user has to search for the grayed out game button
18:37 < Oy> Fisico where else do you want to go? if not the settings tab again? and what about you change sth in settings, try it ingame, and then want to adjust it in the settings. if it jumps somewhere else this might be weird
18:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> it should jump to the game tab
18:38 < Dune> @Fisico: maybe you're right in that buttons shouldn't be grayed out like that if we keep the settings state, it's a bit weird.
18:38 < Dune> not sure
18:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> every other game does this..
18:38 < rand> say, if the server report a client with an id > MAX_CLIENTS (the value from the client build), the client quits because the server lied basically
18:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> if i open a submenu is sc2 and i close it i will be at the default menu if i reopen it
18:38 < Oy> jump everytime to game? when hitting esc?
18:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yep
18:39 < Oy> wasn't that way before
18:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> no
18:39 < Oy> might be weird
18:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> only jump to the game tab if no settings menu is open
18:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ingame -> esc -> game menu opens
18:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> 
18:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> gamemenu -> esx > ingame
18:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> 
18:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ingame -> esc > gamemenu -> settings -> esc -> ingame
18:42 < Dune> oy: that's 0.6 behavior afaik
18:44 < Oy> that's exaclty how it's in 0.7
18:44 < Oy> it's not different than 0.6
18:45 < Dune> huh
18:45 < Dune> do I remember wrong then?
18:46 < Oy> yeah
18:46 < rand> ingame -> esc -> gamemenu -> setting -> esc -> ingame -> esc -> setting
18:46 < Oy> just testet
18:46 < Dune> alright then, my bad :)
18:46 < Oy> :P
18:47 < Dune> I guess it only feels more painful now because the join/disconnect buttons are on the bottom 
18:47 < Oy> probably
18:48 < Oy> might be best to show them everytime
18:48 < minus> why is teeworlds suddenly undead after like 5 years of total deadness
18:48 < minus> did you get fired, oy?
18:48 < Oy> no
18:48 < Dune> oy pushed the red button
18:48 < Oy> motivation is back
18:49 < minus> how
18:49 < minus> i'm getting what you're getting
18:49 < Oy> people work on stuff again
18:49 < minus> but speaking of money, there should still be a bunch of donations left, do you want to put them on bounties maybe?
18:50 < Dune> minus: someone told me ingame "you guys get well paid" :D
18:51 < Oy> most of the people who planned 0.7 got inactive, so i had not motivation as well - and with landil inactive no graphics guy was available, so didn't see a point in continuing
18:51 < Oy> minus: don't have sth in mind that could need a bounty, maybe in the future
18:59 < Dune> ah, sorry, I might be blocking your work with my scoreboard PR, rand
19:00 < Dune> so I don't polish&submit the alpha changes for 0.7.1, oy?
19:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i would submit it ðŸ˜„
19:04 < Oy> Dune: dunno, adding the background might help already. maybe they need to change again after adding the background? or should i skip adding the background?
19:04 < Dune> I don't know, maybe just commit the background and see?
19:05 < Dune> @Fisico: it still needs polishing, that's work I could put elsewhere
19:07 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpRxF
19:07 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master b2a9343 oy: fixed flickering setting sound menu
19:07 < Oy> ok, i'll do the background thing and then we'll see
19:08 < Dune> :)
19:09 < Dune> anything left to do for the theme selection PR?
19:12 < Oy> Dune: looks good
19:12 < Oy> reade to be merged?
19:12 < Dune> yeah, no issue that I know of
19:12 < Oy> ok
19:13 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 8 new commits to master: https://git.io/fpRpZ
19:13 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master e0d292b Jordy Ruiz: Implemnt theme selection, recognize automatically maps and icons in ui/themes
19:13 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 2909152 Jordy Ruiz: Removed now unnecessary menu option to disable map backgrounds
19:13 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 41ebd73 Jordy Ruiz: Create ui/themes folder, move menu maps and rename to jungle
19:13 < rand> Dune: don't worry, I did try to integrate 48 spec in your PR (explaining that I find the hidded 16 in the source)
19:13 < Dune> oh, okay rand, nice to hear
19:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> oO @Dune  @oy the map selector sets the checker background to default... maybe not the best idea dont you think?
19:15 < Dune> huh, does it?
19:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yep
19:16 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> compiled it, started it, checker background
19:16 < Dune> I think not everything was merged then
19:16 < Dune> on your side I mean
19:16 < Dune> it defaults to "jungle"
19:16 < Dune> oh, I know why that happened
19:16 < rand> talking about map, iirc when changing the gametype with sv_gametype, the gametype does not change until the map changes
19:16 < Dune> @Fisico: that's because you have the old "menu" settings. "menu" was renamed to jungle
19:16 < rand> what is the correct way to change gametype ?
19:17 < Dune> yeah rand, maybe should be changed like sv_map was
19:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ah ok
19:17 < Dune> rand: sv_gametype, reload
19:17 < Dune> default is still jungle
19:17 < Dune> although I prefer @sonix's heavens :)
19:17 < rand> doesn't reload re-read the configuration file ?
19:17 < Dune> it looks more like the https://teeworlds.com/ design
19:18 < Dune> rand: it just reloads the map
19:18 < Dune> afaik
19:18 < rand> ok thx, have to update my servers conf :)
19:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @Sonix's heaven should also be included ðŸ˜„
19:20 < Dune> @fisico it is?
19:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i mean the skymap ðŸ˜„
19:25 < Dune> yes, I understood
19:25 < Dune> is it not included, Fisico?
19:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> havens and jungle day/night
19:26 < Dune> yes?
19:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> no skymap
19:26 < Dune> heavens *is* the sky map
19:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> sonix version he sent me had a tileset an looked way better ðŸ˜„
19:27 < Dune> it was less fitting for a background
19:27 < Dune> especially in the server browser
19:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok
19:27 < Dune> but I mean, surely it can be introduced as a custom map
19:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok
19:28 < Dune> but heavens was intended to be a sky afaik
19:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok
19:31 < Dune> I had plans to experiment with a discreet player indicating color gradient: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/355114/48855719-eebc1580-edb4-11e8-87fb-8e687eb11086.png
19:31 < Dune> but I guess I can scrap that for now
19:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> why?
19:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> good idea
19:32 < Dune> needs a lot of discussion, surely.
19:33 < Dune> @Fisico: you can fetch https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/tree/feature-browsercolors-exp if you want to play with it :)
19:33 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/fpRhu
19:33 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 0019212 oy: added a slight background to the menus
19:33 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 43b8bac oy: Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
19:34 < Dune> thanks oy
19:34 < Oy> add the background to every part except the server browser. dunno if it needs it
19:34 < Oy> the text is better readable
19:34 < Oy> dunno if there's much alpha correction needed
19:35 < Dune> trying it out
19:35 < Oy> that little gap that connects to the tab on top is still missing, will wait with that ;)
19:36 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/components/menus.cpp#L38 there you can adjust the strength of the background alpha
19:41 < Dune> oh, making that a variable :)
19:42 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpRhh
19:42 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 519ba26 oy: made make_release script work
19:42 < Oy> in the code yeah, better for testing
19:43 < Dune> had a few experiments that won't make it early enough :|
19:44 < Dune> what would you think about a slight visual difference for damage that is absorbed by armor? it affects gameplay
19:44 < Dune> (but that'd need an additional flag)
19:44 < Dune> no time to try to do it properly
19:45 < Oy> you mean the damage star?
19:45 < Dune> huh
19:45 < Dune> @LordSk you used nullptr again?
19:45 < Dune> yes Oy
19:46 < Dune> I updated and it doesn't compile here
19:46 < Oy> outpu?
19:47 < Oy> i think no damage stars are displayed for absorbed armor right now
19:47 < Dune> ah nevermind, wrong branch, sorry
19:47 < Dune> I accidentally merged master locally
19:47 < Dune> Oy: I was thinking of a tiny visual effect of absorption I've been working on
19:48 < Dune> @LordSk: you used nullptr in your API :p
19:48 < Oy> Dune: dunno, probably needs some discussion :)
19:48 < Oy> probaly too late for 0.71
19:48 < Dune> yeah
19:49 < Oy> but still open an issue
19:49 < Oy> could be added later
19:49 < Dune> yeah I should
19:49 < Dune> well, it needs info from the server
19:49 < Dune> so there's a flag to add in the protocol I guess :|
19:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @Dune no idea
19:52 < Oy> could add a new net event for it. previous client won't be able to handle it and just skip it but updated one will use it
19:52 < Oy> so no biggy, can be added
19:52 < Dune> yeah, that's why I wanted to mention that
19:52 < Dune> doesn't seem too heavy
19:53 < Dune> gtg home, I'll be back
19:53 < Oy> you want to add a placeholder for it to 0.7.1?
19:53 < Dune> yeah Oy
19:53 < Oy> ok
19:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @oy https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1611#issuecomment-440340212
20:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> font is wrong and the top menu is wrong but i hope you get my idea ðŸ˜„
20:01 < Oy> Fisico https://www.solidfiles.com/v/Wqd8AdYLmm5rR
20:04 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] LordSk opened pull request #1711: Display user IDs (master...feature/display_user_id) https://git.io/fpRji
20:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @oy maybe the background a bit lighter?
20:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Maybe yeah
20:25 < Oy> just the deactivated buttons brighter?
20:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> something is not good atm
20:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> background a bit less alpha and also the buttons
20:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> the button should be the same as the back or reset button
20:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> cause there is the black background under it.. the alpha is doubling up
20:35 < Oy> g2g. will try tomorrow
20:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok thx
20:36 <@Dune> see ya
20:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> cy
