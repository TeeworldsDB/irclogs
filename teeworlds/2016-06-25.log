07:10 < needs1> I noticed that since I started teerank : at least one "true" vanilla server does send truncated "info" packets each time it is polled
07:10 < needs1> And 2 other does seems to add extra infos to "info" packets as well
07:11 < needs1> I don't think they are really "true" vanilla servers
07:11 < needs1> despite the fact they have CTF pure gamemode
08:09 < needs1> Euh, it seems to be DDRace servers, so it is more a bug on my side in fact
08:09 < needs1> Arg, I bet it's because of realloc()...
11:22 < EastBite> needs1: show us the codes :p
