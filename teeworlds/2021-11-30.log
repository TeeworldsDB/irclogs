16:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Essigautomat couldn't you instead handle the variation using transparency and 2 layers?
16:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> only if one corner (or edge) has enough space in 1 fourth of a tile (or 1 half for the edge)
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> this is actually not the case for the winter tileset
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes, you could still do this and work with overlaps but you'll run in literal edge cases
22:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> didn't you mean corner cases :D
