00:13 < Edible> is it possible to use my controller to control the tee?
00:13 <@minus> matricks: did you get that registration email?
00:14 < Edible> a controller**
00:14 < Edible> maybe with joy2key or something
00:14 <@matricks> Edible: people have implemented that
00:14 <@matricks> minus: what email? :)
00:14 < Edible> they have?
00:14 <@matricks> yeah
00:14 <@matricks> dunno if there is anything public
00:16 < Edible> it doesnt recognize it.
00:17 <@matricks> the official teeworlds doesn't have that implemented
00:17 < Edible> mmm if there is nothing public... then... well i cant build it
00:17 < Edible> one of those "only the basic stuff on the main build" thing?
00:18 <@matricks> only stuff that makes sense :)
00:18 < Edible> whaaa?
00:18 < Edible> it makes a bunch of sense
00:18 <@matricks> yes, just never been done :)
00:19 <@matricks> and, probably below 1% that would use it
00:19 < Edible> joystick controls where you aim, and the L R buttons shoot and stuff, it would be amazing
00:19 < Edible> you cant say that, because you've never offered the functionality
00:19 <@matricks> I did this like.. 14 years ago with teeworlds..
00:20 < Edible> exactly, now everyone han a ps3 and xbox which you can use easily
00:20 <@matricks> I can say stuff out of prediction, you don't have to make it too see
12:51 < tomew> wtf is happening? using the teeworlds 0.6.3 source and <0.6.3 client. http://puu.sh/dkAwC/bcb81c7c21.txt
13:24 < heinrich5991> that sounds wrong
13:25 < tomew> yea and idk why :o
