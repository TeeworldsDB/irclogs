12:57 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i have trouble finding pr_resize2
12:59 < ChillerDragon> oh omg mi brain ded i searched in Learath2/ddnet ok found it
13:04 < ChillerDragon> i wonder if one still needs xquartz such a weird thing and it blocks my alias x :/
13:09 < ChillerDragon> what should ur pr do i am still able to change resolution
13:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You should be able to change the resolution while the game is running
13:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> (And as a side effect it should fix the weird clipping issue you get with highdpi)
13:31 < ChillerDragon> i cant change resolution while running or with restart
13:31 < ChillerDragon> when i change it it says please restart the game
14:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You sure you compiled my pr? :D
14:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> it does say "You must restart but only because I couldn't be assed to fix the ui
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> sorry @TsFreddie ^^ (github issue)
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> no, i get it.
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> options are actually needs so might be a bad opener.
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> on my part
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: supposed to look like this
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/790210779571027988/rec.webm
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> does bridge support videos
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Tho that's with dbg_resizable 1. Even just changing the resolution should work
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @TsFreddie it sends a link to the bridge
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> cool
15:07 < Kottizen> ChillerDragon: Are you the one with the ctf5 server?
15:26 < ChillerDragon> ye
15:26 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 ah windowed mode
15:27 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 can you do fullscreen and change the resolution to max instead of 1550x900 ?
15:27 < ChillerDragon> 1440*
15:28 < Kottizen> Woh! I played some for the first time in several years a week ago, or so, and all on your server. Fun to see that vanilla is still going strong!
15:28 < ChillerDragon> well strong yea its ok
15:28 < Kottizen> I was amazed to see some clans that I remember were big in 2009-2010... Fogland, e.g.!
15:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> ðŸ‘€ on mac the "resolution" is different from canvas size tho.
15:29 < ChillerDragon> u return to tw Kottizen ? :)
15:29 <@heinrich5991> hi Kottizen o/
15:29 < Kottizen> ChillerDragon: I haven't had a proper setup for years, but now my laptop keyboard broke, and my employer gave me an external one, and an external monitor -- and then, I didn't really have any reason not to return!
15:30 < Kottizen> heinrich5991! Hellooo \o/
15:30 < ChillerDragon> how nice
15:30 < ChillerDragon> if you actually plan to become active on my server i would love to hire you as moderator
15:30 < Kottizen> Can't complain! Would probably not have happened if it wasn't for the coronavirus, so there are not *only* downsides of it!
15:31 <@heinrich5991> I remember Kottizen hosting a lot of servers :) also those that were looked down upon by some of the community like city ;)
15:31 < Kottizen> Ah, oh, we'll see about that! I miss all the instagib servers... But I will probably pick it up again when I'm back after newyears!
15:31 <@heinrich5991> instagib got mostly replaced by FNG, I think
15:32 <@heinrich5991> pirates2+++++xxl has fallen out of fashion ^^
15:32 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:32 < ChillerDragon> good ol times
15:32 < Kottizen> heinrich5991: Ah, right, MikCity, something? There was this Finnish guy who made the map, and I modded the server, if I recall correctly...
15:32 < Kottizen> Pirates! I didn't even remember that one; only thought about Lost.
15:32 <@heinrich5991> MikCity yea. I still remember some secret passage :D
15:34 < Kottizen> I thought I had a big archive of maps at https://archive.kottnet.net/teeworlds/maps/, but it turns out I... don't? :/
15:34 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:34 < ChillerDragon> 3 maps?
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> epicfngmaps.zip
15:34 <@heinrich5991> Kottizen: I think you had a map archive, but it was lost
15:34 <@heinrich5991> I hosted a new one (https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/maps/maps/)
15:35 < Kottizen> Ah, right! We went looking for it, didn't we? I went through some old hard drives?
15:35 <@heinrich5991> yes, went looking for it
15:35 < Kottizen> I still have those, and I don't remember if I ever managed to get into them x.X
15:35 < Kottizen> (Too paranoid to throw hard drives away!)
15:35 <@heinrich5991> but I think we got stuck at some point where you said that it might be on hdds that are at your parent's
15:36 <@heinrich5991> I don't want to take the fun of having rediscovered teeworlds out of you â€“ so only if you feel like you have some spare time, you could check some of the hdds. but only if you feel like you have some spare time ;)
15:37 < Kottizen> I'm on my way to my parents' place now, actually! Will have a look when I get there. Would be fun to try out Pirates again \o/
15:37 <@heinrich5991> we could organize some kind of instagib match on a set date, then we'd have enough players at least :)
15:37 <@heinrich5991> but I probably suck ^^
15:38 < Kottizen> I must say I'm not entirely sure where the hard drives are, though, because I thought I stored them at the top locker in my kitchen. But, if you said that I said that they were at my parents' place, I must have looked in the top locker in the kitchen and realised there was something else there...
15:38 < Kottizen> Haha, I've always gone up to the top to get the laser, at ChillerDragon's server, and I've had to admit that my aim is not what it was :)
15:47 < Kottizen> I think the last time I played Pirates was when 0.4 was out, and I got my school, back then, to allow me to install Teeworlds onto all computers in the PC lab... All those Flash games that you could play were so slow on those computers; Teeworlds was the only game that actually worked :') 
15:48 < Kottizen> Easily filled up one, and sometimes even two, LAN servers!
15:49 < ChillerDragon> hearing about tw lanpartys always sounds so unreal
15:49 <@heinrich5991> we did those in school
15:49 < Kottizen> ChillerDragon: This was during the lunch breaks :)
15:49 < ChillerDragon> the game is so unpopular i wonder how just one school can have enough ppl interested in tw 
15:49 <@heinrich5991> ofc, no one would dare play during lessons
15:49 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:50 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: it's as simple as: hey guys, check out this cool game. and you have 10 ppl playing
15:50 < ChillerDragon> i trued
15:50 < ChillerDragon> tried
15:50 <@heinrich5991> we also had a copy of cs1.6 on the school servers, that was also fun ;)
15:50 < ChillerDragon> i miss cs :/
15:50 < ChillerDragon> cant get it running on arch .-.
15:51 < Kottizen> ChillerDragon: Before you had smartphones, and before Farmville was a thing at Facebook, the only thing you could do during the breaks was to play Flash games, but if those lag, and somebody offers you a game that doesn't -- wouldn't you play? \o/ 
15:51 <@heinrich5991> cs:go runs natively on linux ChillerDragon. check arch wiki if you need help
15:51 < ChillerDragon> so it was forced xd
15:51 < Kottizen> I think we could watch MVT too, now that I think about it...
15:51 < ChillerDragon> native lul since when
15:51 < Kottizen> MTV it's called, maybe
15:52 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: since 2014
15:52 < ChillerDragon> woot
15:52 < ChillerDragon> did valve develop a linux specific version?
15:52 <@heinrich5991> all valve games run natively under linux
15:52 < Kottizen> ChillerDragon: Haven't pacman -Syu'ed since 2014? :D
15:52 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:53 < ChillerDragon> in 2014 i didnt even know what linux is or how to turn off windows
15:53 < ChillerDragon> this one heinrich5991 ? https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Steam/Game-specific_troubleshooting#Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_(CS:GO)
15:54 < Kottizen> I've had my Arch Linux installation for almost 2,5 years now, without re-installing! Quite proud, I must say. :)
15:54 <@heinrich5991> steam also runs natively if you didn't know
15:54 <@heinrich5991> pacman -S steam
15:54 < ChillerDragon> so i run csgo via steam?
15:54 <@heinrich5991> yes
15:54 < ChillerDragon> that doesnt work for me :/
15:54 < Kottizen> At one point I was close to re-install it, when everything broke after an update, but then it turns out it was the theme in KDE's login manager...
15:54 < ChillerDragon> it does not launch
15:54 <@heinrich5991> have you checked the logs? what does not launch? steam? or cs:go via steam?
15:55 < ChillerDragon> csgo
15:55 < ChillerDragon> idk where to find logs :D
15:55 < ChillerDragon> lemme retry
15:55 <@heinrich5991> start steam in the console. start cs:go. find the logs in the console
15:55 < ChillerDragon> it detaches in console
15:55 <@heinrich5991> hm?
15:56 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1608475999.png
15:56 < ChillerDragon> the log does not seem to stay open
15:56 <@heinrich5991> did you close steam beforehand?
15:56 < ChillerDragon> ah
15:56 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:56 <@heinrich5991> otherwise it won't start another instance
15:56 < ChillerDragon> pro ye
15:56 < ChillerDragon> ok lets wait 100h for the update first
15:56 <@heinrich5991> $ head -n1 /var/log/pacman.log
15:56 <@heinrich5991> [2012-09-03 17:38] installed filesystem (2012.8-1)
15:57 < Kottizen> o_O
15:57 <@heinrich5991> my arch linux system has been running for 8 years now :D
15:57 < Kottizen> [2018-05-30 07:47] [PACMAN] Running 'pacman -r /mnt -Sy --cachedir=/mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg --noconfirm base'
15:57 < Kottizen> Impressive!
15:58 < Kottizen> Also impressive that you still have the same computer, or at least, disk (?)!
15:58 <@heinrich5991> yea, actually same computer
15:58 <@heinrich5991> new graphics card, more ram, more disks
15:58 <@heinrich5991> at some point I'm going to need a new CPU
15:58 < Kottizen> Is it a mechanical disk?
15:58 <@heinrich5991> yes
15:58 <@heinrich5991> no ssd yet
15:58 <@heinrich5991> in that computer
15:59 < Kottizen> Wow... You should try it out!
15:59 <@heinrich5991> :D
15:59 < ChillerDragon> i swear last time i tried csgo it advertised some proton what ever runtime and was runnign some exe
15:59 < ChillerDragon> why would valve invest in native developtment im rly confused
15:59 <@heinrich5991> native cs:go is older than proton
16:00 <@heinrich5991> I think people said that valve sees it as a hedge against microsoft trying to enter their revenue stream
16:00 < ChillerDragon> ah nice
16:01 <@heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steam_(service)&oldid=994969389#Linux
16:04 < ChillerDragon> not bad
16:05 < ChillerDragon> i wonder if there are any open source multiplayer egoshooter
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> sauerbraten
16:05 < ChillerDragon> well sure
16:05 < ChillerDragon> but thats not very pleasing to look at isnt it?
16:05 <@heinrich5991> huh? I liked playing it
16:05 <@heinrich5991> instagib venice all day ;)
16:06 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1608476598.png
16:06 < ChillerDragon> well compared to csgo it looks unpleasing
16:07 < ChillerDragon> maybe if i were grown up with sauerbraten it would be different
16:08 < ChillerDragon> i mean there has to be something more right?
16:08 < Kottizen> Ah, Sauerbraten! :'D Is that still a thing?
16:08 <@heinrich5991> yep, had a release recently
16:08 <@heinrich5991> somehow it managed to screw up my multimonitor setup right now tho
16:08 <@heinrich5991> fullscreen games are bad for that :(
16:09 < ChillerDragon> sadly i cant handle the style
16:09 < Kottizen> Whoosh! I remember it was way too easy to compile a modified client with no gravity, allowing steady camping high up in the air -- above the Venice map :')
16:09 < ChillerDragon> i mean nowerdays it should be possible that one hobby dev builds a game that has a lighter and cleaner look and is a working multiplayer game right?
16:10 < Kottizen> Probably... I remember the graphics being pretty impressive, though, at least compared to what other games you could play on Linux
16:11 < ChillerDragon> yes im sure sauerbraten is a impressive project
16:11 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1608476948.png
16:12 < ChillerDragon> why does steam look like windows xp
16:13 < Kottizen> Is Steam for Windows just Steam wrapped in Wine?
16:13 <@heinrich5991> no
16:13 <@heinrich5991> native application
16:13 < Kottizen> Steam for Linux*, of course
16:13 < Kottizen> But ah!
16:14 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: you installed steam via pacman?
16:14 < ChillerDragon> i think so
16:14 <@heinrich5991> $ which steam
16:14 < ChillerDragon> usr bin
16:14 <@heinrich5991> $ pacman -Q steam
16:15 < ChillerDragon> steam 1.0.0.68-1
16:15 < ChillerDragon> what is Q ?
16:15 < ChillerDragon> like version?
16:15 < ChillerDragon> im yay nub i never use pacman xd
16:16 <@heinrich5991> yes
16:16 <@heinrich5991> and what does the console output say when you get that error message you posted?
16:16 < ChillerDragon> i just updated in the steamui is that bad?
16:17 < ChillerDragon> im always not sure if a app wants to update it self when i installed it via a packetmanager
16:17 < ChillerDragon> log is so spammy sec
16:18 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/f4
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Steam#Installation
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> have you followed this?
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> especially the first three points
16:28 < ChillerDragon> oh its actually running now
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if that was actually the fix; could you please start reading the manual before you ask me?
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> this is getting annoying
16:29 < ChillerDragon> ah no
16:29 < ChillerDragon> it just worked
16:29 < ChillerDragon> idk what changed
16:37 <@heinrich5991> I just played a round of sauerbraten
16:37 <@heinrich5991> nice it's still alive :)
16:37 < ChillerDragon> oka ima try it now
16:53 < ChillerDragon> ok it is fun has a nice flow and all. Also brighter maps than i thought but i just cant handle the artstyle.
16:53 < ChillerDragon> The bots look like creatures from nightmares just unpleasing to look at.
17:47 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 hm ok dbg_resizable 1 allows me to change resolution but i cant get the window dragging to work like u showed it in the video
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> For dragging to work you need to launch resizable
17:49 < ChillerDragon> ah
17:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> So you only get the clipping issue in fullscreen?
17:50 < ChillerDragon> clipping issue?
17:50 < ChillerDragon> i still cant resize i run ./teeworlds dbg_resizable 1
17:51 < ChillerDragon> i cant drag resize i mean
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You need quotes iirc
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Tw only parses a single argument
17:52 < ChillerDragon> still
17:52 < ChillerDragon> ah wait its not 1
17:52 < ChillerDragon> hmm sec
17:53 < ChillerDragon> ah its dbg_resizable not dbg_resizeable
17:53 < ChillerDragon> ok now it works fine
17:53 < ChillerDragon> test successful i guess
17:54 < ChillerDragon> on macOS Big sur btw
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You are compiling on big sur and it works? Wtf
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You are supposed to get an instant SIGILL on anything above Catalina without an SDL patch
17:57 < ChillerDragon> maybe its a bug
17:57 < ChillerDragon> that fixed the other bug
17:58 < ChillerDragon> but so far i cant complain regarding tw expirience on big sur
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Can you do an otool -L on your teeworlds executable?
17:58 < ChillerDragon> meh mac is off
17:58 < ChillerDragon> ok ima boot again
17:59 < ChillerDragon> https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/AU
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Um there is no way this works with the bundled sdl, wtf???
20:02 < ChillerDragon> [5fdf9f93][server]: failed to load map. mapname='ctf5'
20:03 < ChillerDragon> gaaaaaah i swear i just restarted the server :/
20:03 < ChillerDragon> i wish teeworlds/teeworlds-maps had releases
20:03 < ChillerDragon> do i rly have to download a zip from teeworlds.com to get the map?
20:05 < ChillerDragon> hm the map from the 0.6.5 rls doesnt seem to work arent they all compatible in 0.6?
20:07 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1608491065.png
20:07 < ChillerDragon> thats it im officialy crazy xd
20:11 < ChillerDragon> xd ok got it running. seems like 32bit elf files throw a weird warning and maps/ works bettern in the data/maps dir
20:12 < ChillerDragon> but if we keep the map checker around we probably should provide some easy way to get official maps 
23:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ChillerDragon it would be great to debug why sdl works for you sometime
23:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> If we can figure out how it works for you maybe we can get it to work everywhere
