01:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune do you think that error report is steam exclusive?
01:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> my steem stopped working on my mac :c
01:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> for me steam and standalone worked fine but i guess i have the libs installed systemwide anyways
01:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> No idea @ChillerDragon
01:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I tried uninstalling sdl and deleting all libs from steam folder but i couldnt get tw to fail the start. I have to search a device without any dev tools or libs installed tomorrow
02:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> would be pretty cool yeah
02:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> we had the problem on windows too
13:10 < ChillerDragon> ok tw launched fine from command line on a new macbook
13:10 < ChillerDragon> the standalone
13:16 < ChillerDragon> $ ./teeworlds dyld: Library not loaded: @executable_path/../Frameworks/libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib   Referenced from: /Users/apple/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Teeworlds/tw/./teeworlds   Reason: image not found Abort trap: 6
13:16 < ChillerDragon> error of the steam version
13:26 < ChillerDragon> okay the fix from the guy on steam worked
13:27 < ChillerDragon> So it looks for the Frameworks folder one directory above the tw binary
13:28 < ChillerDragon> so we have to put the Frameworks folder next to the tw folder and not into the tw folder in the steam release
13:29 < ChillerDragon> who crafted the steam version? How does that even work?
14:12 < Dune> @ChillerDragon I crafted it
14:12 < Dune> so I  probably fucked that up
14:12 < Dune> we can hotfix

14:24 < Dune> @ChillerDragon I'll make a test branch and ping you when it's ready if you don't mind
14:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Sure but im not in the apple store anymore :c
14:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe i can uninstall my sdl somehow .-,
14:25 < day> Dune: hi Dune :3
14:25 < Dune> ah, well okay then, that's fine. shouldn't be too hard to make sure it's the right folder tree
14:25 < Dune> day: hi day
14:26 < day> Dune: btw. did you visit this programming night event in germany?
14:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what when where?
14:27 < Dune> not sure which one you are talking about, but I've never been to germany so that should answer it
14:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd come visit me
14:27 < day> GPN? gulasch programming night or something
14:27 < Dune> right
14:27 < day> i think heinrich5991 started talking about it a while back
14:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye
19:38 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 2 commits to branch master:
19:38 < Teeworlds>  • ChillerDragon (6d519e3): Lower min mousesens…
19:38 < Teeworlds>  • oy (325a4e2): Merge pull request #2176 from ChillerDragon/pr_low_mousesens…
19:43 < Dune> hey Oy
19:43 < Dune> @ChillerDragon investigated the mac issue at https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2159
19:43 < Dune> turns out I apparently packaged steam wrong
19:43 < Dune> I will just hotfix that
19:46 < Oy> hey
19:47 < Oy> ok :)
19:48 < Oy> the mac app has some static paths, they probably don't match in the steam package
19:53 < Dune> ./tw:
19:53 < Dune> Frameworks  teeworlds  teeworlds_server  teeworlds_srv
19:53 < Dune> so apparently this is not good
19:55 < Dune> not sure if I should write an announcement on steam. maybe there is a dev blog of some sort there
19:57 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/scripts/make_release.py#L177 that's how it's set
19:58 < Oy> either we change the path structure for steam or change the excutable for steam
20:02 < Dune> I fixed the structure on Steam
20:02 < Dune> @ChillerDragon could you check that the test branch has a correct structure?
22:07 <@heinrich5991> Dune: the tw subfolder exists because of the frameworks path ^^
22:16 < Dune> I don't know what you mean, I fixed the folder structure either way
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune I finally managed it to uninstall my SDL o.O so i can test it on my machine as well yay
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so is there a new steam app to test?
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i forgot how the steam beta thing worked
22:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hmm well not really...
22:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i found the test branch again. But no matter what version from the steam ui it launches fine and from the commandline i always get the lib error.
23:07 <@heinrich5991> Dune: can you show me the binary currently used in the steam build?
23:08 < Dune> heinrich5991, it's the binary from teeworlds.com
