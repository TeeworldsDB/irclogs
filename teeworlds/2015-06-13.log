00:01 < Savander> :D
00:07 < chsk> wot
00:07 < Savander> https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=432624042
00:10 <@matricks> is heinrich5991 valves contact person?
00:11 < Savander> http://www.savander.pl/img/Mdotkh618810 those people probably have contact.
00:11 < Savander> because of "creators'
00:11 < Savander> on creator list
00:12 <@matricks> ok
00:12 <@minus> heinrich5991 is the caretaker
00:13 < chsk> you don't even want to use workshop ;_;
00:13 < BotoX> I guess it could be used for skins
00:13 < Learath2> we are prolly only there for community
00:13 < BotoX> weaponskins, maybe map tilesets
00:13 < Savander> and modifications ( to rate )
00:13 < Savander> client side, server side
00:14 < BotoX> eh, doubt it
00:14 < BotoX> since there is no plugin support or anything like that
00:14 < Savander> but
00:14 < BotoX> And I doubt you can replace the main game with the workshop, can you?
00:14 < Savander> but maybe just to promote your client, without any downloads?
00:14 < Savander> with rating
00:15 < BotoX> matricks: what about the resource stuff you did a while ago (https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds/tree/ressys)
00:15 <@matricks> that branch only needs the exe to boot :P
00:15 < BotoX> yeah
00:15 < BotoX> would be great for mods too, not?
00:16 <@matricks> well, yah
00:16 < BotoX> server sends custom textures and stuff to client
00:16 < BotoX> custom sounds for zombie mods or w/e :D
00:16 < Savander> what is it?
00:16 < BotoX> the game resources are downloaded from an external server via HTTP, after launching the game or joining a server
00:16 < Savander> ou
00:17 < chsk> the most important question is, are you going to include an in-game economy?
00:17 < Savander> like counter -strike
00:17 <@matricks> disk, cache, http, game server
00:17 < Savander>  ingame economy??!
00:17 <@matricks> aww for fuck safe
00:17 <@matricks> sake
00:17 < BotoX> you only need the teeworlds.exe and when you join a server the files are loaded shortly afterwards
00:17 < chsk> but muh hats
00:17 < Savander> oh, great thing
00:18 < Learath2> please no tees with hats
00:18 < Savander> it'll be very helpfull for everyone who want to make mods, with using custom sounds etc.
00:18 < Savander> or new weapons(?)
00:18 < Savander> so it's just base for everything?
00:18 < Learath2> new weapons cant be done
00:18 < BotoX> tfw I added https://sourceware.org/libffi/ to teamspeak3 to export the client API via telnet and the function I need has been deprecated
00:18 < Savander> Learath, i mean
00:18 < Savander> replace grenade 
00:19 < Savander> (gameskin) with another
00:19 <@minus> BotoX: use the replacement then?
00:19 < Learath2> surely possible
00:19 <@minus> also currently having ffi troubles :|
00:19 < BotoX> replacement?
00:19 < BotoX> I mean the teamspeak3 api function has been deprecated and is broken
00:19 < BotoX> there is no replacement for it :D
00:20 < BotoX> you can change settings through the GUI
00:20 <@minus> :|
00:20 <@matricks> I wonder if they gonna make you sign any form of NDA
00:20 < BotoX> valve?
00:21 < BotoX> for teeworlds @ steam?
00:21 <@minus> sorry matricks, can't tell you
00:21 <@matricks> yah
00:21 < BotoX> lmao
00:21 < Learath2> matricks: i think they do if you use steamapi stuff
00:21 <@minus> ;D
00:21 < BotoX> isn't there an open steam api too
00:21 < BotoX> a reversed one
00:21 <@matricks> Learath2: I would guess so yes
00:22 <@matricks> and if that happens.. well
00:22 <@matricks> no more open source teeworlds
00:22 < Learath2> dont think that will ever happen
00:22 < BotoX> well, just another branch with steam integration or something like that?
00:22 <@matricks> BotoX: a closed version that is
00:23 < Learath2> dont think we have any reason to use steam stuff tho unless we want accounts
00:23 <@matricks> Learath2: I didn't think teeworlds would go on steam to begin with
00:23 < BotoX> I guess it won't break the NDA to release the game without their headers
00:23 < BotoX> and with the functions in ifdefs so you can build it without steam support
00:23 < BotoX> https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTQ4NTY
00:23 <@matricks> and now you are spliting people into two groups
00:24 <@minus> relax, matricks. heinrich5991's got it covered
00:24 < Learath2> and the groups are ?
00:25 <@matricks> Learath2: steam users vs none steam users
00:25 < BotoX> https://github.com/SteamRE/open-steamworks
00:25 < BotoX> ah right
00:25 < BotoX> this
00:25 < BotoX> no need to sign any NDAs :)
00:26 <@matricks> lol
00:26 <@matricks> use that and they will rip you off from steam I guess
00:26 < BotoX> I think you can put up a game on steam without using steamworks too
00:26 <@matricks> BotoX: you can
00:26 < BotoX> so wouldn't using that work too? D:
00:28 <@matricks> oh well, I've voiced my oppinion on steam several times before, no need for me to rant on again
00:28 <@matricks> gonna sleep instead
00:29 < Learath2> nite matricks hope we didnt give you nightmares :P
00:29 <@matricks> already have
00:29 < Savander> Are Steamworks features required for distribution on Steam?
00:29 < Savander> Many of our Steamworks features are popular with customers – like Steam Cloud support and Achievements. While we recommend that you include them in your games, they are not required.
00:29 <@matricks> should have switched the licence to GPL :/
00:30 <@matricks> Savander: they are not
00:30 < Learath2> what would gpl imply
00:30 < BotoX> doubt teeworlds is going to be proprietary matricks 
00:30 <@matricks> BotoX: doesn't matter, its steam that I don't like
00:30 < BotoX> I see
00:30 <@matricks> and I don't like supporting that kinda stuff
00:31 < BotoX> I'm wondering how this will turn out
00:31 < BotoX> but since a lot of other open source games aren't available on Steam I am guessing not so good
00:31 < chsk> it's not like it's gonna happen any time soon
00:31 < chsk> https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=125965803
00:32 < chsk> still hasn't been published
00:32 <@matricks> I don't get why people are screaming to have their stuff locked in
00:32 < BotoX> steam is a pretty cool platform for consumers
00:32 < BotoX> at least from my and my friends experience
00:33 <@matricks> pretty cool platform to get fucked over by as well so
00:33 < BotoX> fucked over, in which sense?
00:33 < BotoX> as a consumer or a developer?
00:34 <@matricks> they control your data, sence when have that been a good idea?
00:34 <@matricks> since..
00:34 < BotoX> gaming statistics?
00:34 <@matricks> yes, they are being goodie goodie now, but in the future?
00:34 < BotoX> or all your purchased games?
00:34 <@matricks> BotoX: your games!
00:34 < BotoX> ah, right
00:35 <@matricks> it's a huge vendor lockin
00:35 < BotoX> hmm, I guess they will be in trouble if they deny you access to them
00:36 < BotoX> I only spent like 10â‚¬ on steam by now :V
00:36 < Learath2> well we needed new players if steams agreement doesnt work for us we dont even have to go through with it
00:36 < Learath2> ill go to sleep nite everyone 
00:36 <@matricks> wtf
00:36 <@matricks> this is another thing I dont get
00:37 <@matricks> since when did teeworlds enter a popularity contest?
00:37 < BotoX> since it has been loosing players I guess
00:37 <@matricks> BotoX: so?
00:37 < BotoX> I guess people that like the game don't want that to happen?
00:37 < Learath2> my god why would you want the game to die off ?
00:38 < BotoX> Same thing for me and CS: Source, been playing it for like 6 years and it's changed so much since CS: Go
00:38 < BotoX> I also lost most of my interest in playing any games nowadays
00:38 <@matricks> games die off, don't ruin a good game just to try to retain players
00:38 < BotoX> tfw all games are about nowadays is skins and fucking hats
00:39 < BotoX> a game is only good with good players in my opinion
00:39 < BotoX> players I've been playing with have left teeworlds -> I've lost interest in it, same for CS: Source
00:39 < BotoX> it's the people that make a game fun!
00:40 < BotoX> so getting more people to play teeworlds isn't a bad idea imo.
00:42 <@matricks> heh, and I stop playing some games because of the people
00:42 < BotoX> oh wow
00:42 <@matricks> you need the right kind of people
00:42 < BotoX> yeah, that's what I meant too
00:42 < BotoX> new people sometimes can kill a game too
00:43 <@matricks> anyway, I need sleep, flying day tomorrow
00:43 < BotoX> (eg. game goes on sale for really cheap -> lots of kids start appearing ruining the atmosphere :v)
00:43 <@minus> gnight, hf tomorrow
00:43 < BotoX> flying with a plane or a parachute/glider?
00:43 <@minus> gonna go sleep as well
00:43 <@matricks> glider
00:43 <@matricks> paraglider
00:43 < BotoX> Well, I'll be going too then! Nice, have fun.
00:43 < Learath2> thats nice
00:43 < Learath2> hf gliding
00:44 <@minus> https://pypi.python.org/pypi/guv/0.35.2 this lib is disappointing. websockets but they don't seem to work :(
20:16 < slinack> hi, there :) i was looking at the docs and couldn't more information on mod_command
20:16 < slinack> is it possible to set all commands as enabled and then disable only the ones you don't want the mods to have access?
20:17 < Savander> don't think so
20:29 < slinack> k, thanks
21:03 < Pathos> Hi slinack 
21:40 < BotoX> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/8baca52f3e8c2dab3e4636b70d5b3d41365414d6
21:40 < BotoX> has this ever been fixed
21:41 < BotoX> guess not lmao
21:43 < Pathos> CTF game going on at 96.231.24.94:8303
