00:15 < Assa> @TeeSlayer I changed StartWeapon, so you don't need to restart the round. The command name is now 'start_weapon' instead of 'sv_start_weapon'
14:01 <@Dune> hey Assa 
14:01 <@Dune> why are you printing the dots and the line itself differently?
14:01 <@Dune> just print them all together?
14:28 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 5 commits to branch master:
14:28 < Teeworlds>  • AssassinTee (bcac113): implemented visuals for buffered chat #2124
14:28 < Teeworlds>  • AssassinTee (efac8f1): added localizations and reworked truncated string in buffered string
14:28 < Teeworlds>  • AssassinTee (dc3257c): changed truncation limit to a width instead of a charackter length
16:22 < Assa> because the first TextEx has a width limited cursor and the string i input is actually longer
16:22 < Assa> and in the second i just append the dots
16:25 <@Dune> I see :)
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> meh why does
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> gdb ./teeworlds_srv "logfile foo.log"
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not work? :c
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it doesnt create a logfile
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> without gdb it works tho
19:35 < Oy> ChillerDragon https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1773
19:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nvm fixed the logthing
19:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> didnt know gdb needs --args flag
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oy manifest solved windows
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the pr from LordSk optimized macOS
19:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> macos is not perfect yet but with lordsks pr its at least better
19:37 < Oy> ok
19:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon you can also pass commands to the program by giving them to the `run` command inside gdb. thanks for the `--args` thing, didn't know that and it doesn't even appear on the man page
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> gdb --help > man gdb
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ya the run command is convient for manual testing
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but not for half production half debugging scripts with timestamps etc
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> gsd
20:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> gdb and valgrind is important for tw!!!
20:44 < Assa> valgrind is one of the most important tools in general
20:45 < Assa> in my last company smartpointers where the solution to every valgrind error ...
20:45 < Assa> free/delete? never heard of that
20:47 <@Dune> uhhh
20:47 <@Dune> smart pointers avoid a lot of small bugs but can create some very big bugs :D
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> more so than normal pointers?
20:48 <@Dune> when you have a double free on a smart pointer, more than normal pointers in my experience
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> how can you have a double free on a unique_ptr or shared_ptr?
20:48 <@Dune> good question
20:49 <@Dune> I am not sure if I have ever figured
20:49 <@Dune> I think I fixed it without knowing why it fixed it
21:10 < Ryozuki> if you use smart pointers correctly you cant get a double free, using make_shader and make_unique should avoid these, and also u shouldnt use .get on the smart pointer and then delete it
21:11 < Ryozuki> thats what i think
21:11 < Ryozuki> make_shared*
21:11 <@Dune> the problem is I rarely see an application that uses *only* smart pointers
21:12 < Ryozuki> cuz most apps are settled on old code
21:12 < Ryozuki> smart pointers are the recommended way to go
21:13 <@Dune> are c++17 features also the "recommended" way to go? :P
21:13 < Ryozuki> yea

21:51 < Oy> can't reproduce https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=122973#p122973
22:03 <@Dune> Oy, that's an option, ideally there should be a popup at start
