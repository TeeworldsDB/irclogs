10:22 < JulianAssange> how's your waifuu yemDX 
10:22 <@minus> just tried switching back the internets from linux router to plastic all-in-one box
10:23 <@minus> exchanged the telephone plugs and it wouldn't even sync DSL
10:23 < JulianAssange> im hacking you
10:23 <@minus> switched back to the other one then which didn't work either
10:23 <@minus> i think the telephone port in the wall might be damaged
10:24 <@minus> the second port worked though, but you just get the plug in there with force
10:24 <@minus> stupid telephone thingies

19:14 < Madara> hello!
19:14 <@matricks> HAI!
19:15 < Madara> I've asked it in the forum, but can someone help me out with my questions?
19:15 <@matricks> dunno
19:15 < Madara> Is it possible to exec a program in teeworlds?
19:16 < Madara> Or a skript.
19:16 <@matricks> no
19:16 < Madara> Was it possible?
19:16 < Madara> Because I had the idea to make own commands..
19:16 < Madara> And I stumbled over things like aimbot.exe
19:16 <@matricks> well, you can exec a console script, but I don't think thats what you are after
19:16 < Madara> yeah a console script.
19:17 < Madara> Or a c-program
19:17 <@matricks> tw console script.. not like bash or so
19:17 < Madara> ok.
19:17 <@matricks> nope, that can't be done
19:17 < Madara> And how does aimbot.exe work?
19:17 <@matricks> dunno
19:17 < Madara> Because it seems tw is using that as normal command..
19:18 <@matricks> I have no idea what you are talking about right now
19:18 < Madara> I've seen videos which opened the tw-console, typed in exec <insert hack>.exe
19:18 < Madara> And it worked.
19:18 <@matricks> could be a modded client
19:19 < Madara> The description was like "Download this virus (hack) and insert it in your tw-folder"
19:19 < Madara> How flexible is tw-scripting?
19:19 <@matricks> you mean implementing it into the game?
19:20 < Madara> Okay. Different questions. What's the best way to create tw-commands with intelligence. not just config
19:20 < Madara> Handling with variables and so on.
19:20 < Madara> Hacking the src or is there a different way?
19:21 <@matricks> hacking the src is the way
19:21 <@matricks> and has been done in other clients
19:21 < Madara> Tried that months ago, but didn't find the place in the src where the commands are.
19:21 < Madara> May you help a noob out? thx
19:22 <@matricks> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L225
19:23 <@matricks> some client commands being registered
19:23 <@minus> oh, the naruto guy from the forums
19:24 <@minus> anyway, portal2 time
19:24 < EastBite> minus: <3
19:34 < Madara> matricks.. what would you think about a client-side rainbow color?
19:35 < Madara> Wouldn't stress the server..
19:35 <@matricks> stupid
19:35 < Madara> why?
19:36 <@matricks> oh.. client side.. still stupid
19:36 < EastBite> why would anyone want a rainbow animated skin?
19:36 < Madara> Because swag?
19:36 <@matricks> EastBite: see my previous statement
19:37 < Madara> imo it looks cool.
19:37 <@matricks> focus on the game instead
19:38 < Madara> Also gif skins would be cool imo
19:39 <@minus> portal2 runs incredibly well
19:40 < EastBite> I know :)
19:40 <@minus> EastBite: wanna coop?
19:40 <@minus> since heinrich5991 seems to be idle/afk
19:40 < EastBite> I'm busy right now :/
19:41 <@matricks> gif...
