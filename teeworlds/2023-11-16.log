16:57 < ChillerDragon> @d_une how is the letter going?
16:58 < bridge> <d_une> 0%
17:37 < ChillerDragon> :c
17:39 < bridge> <lukure> ChillerDragon, haven't you been waiting for this since 2018 XD
17:40 < bridge> <d_une> it's been about 6 months
18:10 < ChillerDragon> Yea its time to get some merges in! Compile warnings are piling. And open prs as well. And heinrich is even running around telling people not to work on the project because Oy won't merge anyways.
18:11 < ChillerDragon> robsti yeeted out so many prs and they all became stale
18:11 < ChillerDragon> ddnet in the meantime hired the dude as an admin and ddnet code base is booming because of this relentless coding soul
18:13 < bridge> <d_une> LoCs changed is not a good metric
18:13 < ChillerDragon> im not talkin LoCs
18:13 < ChillerDragon> code quality improvements, bug fixes and new features
18:14 < bridge> <d_une> it's difficult to write Oy a letter that I don't believe in
18:14 < bridge> <d_une> but we've had this chat a couple times before
18:14 < ChillerDragon> heinrich, robsit, dune, lerato and maybe even more should get merge powers and also permission to merge alone if oy is not there.
18:14 < bridge> <d_une> I disagree
18:14 < ChillerDragon> whats your proposale?
18:14 < ChillerDragon> leave as is?
18:15 < bridge> <d_une> it's up to oy to decide anyway
18:15 < ChillerDragon> @d_une the letter is about him joining irc so we can talk
18:15 < ChillerDragon> you know that right?
18:15 < ChillerDragon> you dont belive in talking about the current situation?
18:17 < bridge> <d_une> I struggle to see what good could concretely come out of it
18:17 < bridge> <d_une> though I beg to be surprised
18:23 < ChillerDragon> The good is the development getting unstaled. The current situation is ba because the code starts to smell and new developers are discuraged to join. And even new players might think the game is dead. Which heck it is.
18:24 < ChillerDragon> The open prs getting merged would be good, dont you think?
18:25 < bridge> <d_une> do you think 0.7.6 would have a significant impact on how the game is doing?
18:34 < ChillerDragon> no
18:35 < ChillerDragon> do you think 0.7.6 would be "no good" compared to nothing being done on the code for a few more years?
18:37 < bridge> <d_une> no, it would be a bit better
18:37 < ChillerDragon> what risk do you see?
18:37 < bridge> <d_une> not so much risk as wasted energy
18:37 < ChillerDragon> whos energy?
18:38 < bridge> <d_une> everyone that's going to be involved in what you're asking for
18:38 < ChillerDragon> isnt it their decision if they want to put in time?
18:44 < bridge> <d_une> alright, sent the letter
19:12 < ChillerDragon> omg wot dune
19:12 < ChillerDragon> poggies thanks
21:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> that's not what I did
21:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I asked you whether you think it's a good idea to encourage people to work on it
21:08 < bridge> <heinrich5991> I did not talk to the contributor
21:25 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I totally knew you would say that. Let me be bit dramatic to make a point. You stated that you think it is a bad idea and the contributor got pinged.
21:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> not by me
21:26 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Not by you
21:26 < bridge> <heinrich5991> it's not nice to say that people said things they did not
21:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ok ok
21:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> You said that tho \:p
21:27 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Just not to the contributor
21:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> How am I supposed to pack that in a juicy point during a live chat
21:28 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heinrich told me he thinks it’s not good to tell people to contribute… ? \:D
