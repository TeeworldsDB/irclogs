21:09 < Nouaa> ChillerDragon: cun u tell me how to add simple bot (like entities) in my own server without take ddnet/f-ddrace
21:10 < Nouaa> i dont care about race ect i just want dummy spawn/disconnect
21:10 < Nouaa> ddnet++*
21:12 < Nouaa> fokkonaut said that too hard to explain so maybe make a tutorial on github with the necessary files
22:10 < bridge> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> @Nouaa idk what you mean by "entities" and whats the issue with using ddnet++ or f-ddrace. But if you look for a diff you can slap into your mod i found this commit its a bit messy and idk if it actually works https://github.com/ChillerDragon/ddnet-10.8.6-dummys/commit/cecc540cd65dde38cdc078548f1031e39f53756c
