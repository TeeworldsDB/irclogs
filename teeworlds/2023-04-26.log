10:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> magical edge, yes
10:01 < bridge> <fokkonaut> forward it to ddnet, look how they react. but i dont know if they even want to fix it
10:05 < ChillerDragon> i dont think assa cares about ddnet 
10:05 < ChillerDragon> sounds more like his epic gctf 0.7 flag capture got stopped by an edge xd
10:06 < bridge> <fokkonaut> would have been stopped anyways, since he would have fallen down then
