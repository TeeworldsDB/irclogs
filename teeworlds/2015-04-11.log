19:54 < BotoX> PC MASTER RACE
19:55 < BotoX> Enjoy your 30fps matricks !!! :PP
19:55 < matricks> BotoX: you said to the guy releasing games for the consoles that runs 60
19:55 < BotoX> b-but can they run on 1440p!
19:55 < matricks> havn't been like that on consoles for.. erh.. 8 years now?
19:55 < matricks> BotoX: can your 400 euro pc do that?
19:56 < BotoX> pfffffffffttttttt
19:56 < BotoX> if a 400 euro graphics card counts as a PC
19:56 < BotoX> I guess maybe some new APUs can
19:56 < BotoX> but at least I don't have to spend a shitton of money on the games
19:57 < matricks> no, you have to spend it on your rig instead
19:57 < matricks> :)
19:57 < matricks> btw, consoles games have been heavily multithreaded for a long time now
19:57 <@minus> about to print some custom game cards
19:57 <@minus> need colors
19:57 <@minus> so i used coder colors
19:58 <@minus> R, G & B
19:58 <@minus> now to find a color printer
22:57 < BotoX>   File "msyu.py", line 410, in KeepTS3ClientsAlive
22:57 < BotoX>     client.ts3conn.__send_keepalive_beacon()
22:57 < BotoX> AttributeError: 'TS3Connection' object has no attribute '_MsyuA__send_keepalive_beacon'
22:57 < BotoX> what is going on here D:
22:58 < BotoX> the class this is being run in is called MsyuA, but what does that name do in there
23:00 < BotoX> oh wow, removing the __ fixed it
23:00 < BotoX> aka. renaming the function
23:09 < heinrich5991> BotoX: __ is truly private :)
23:09 < BotoX> yeah, I've read up on that, heh
