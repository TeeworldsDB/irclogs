20:31 < Neox_> Hello, I would like to report a client crashbug
20:31 < Neox_> (and a fix for it please because I need it), the crash exists in vanilla clients too
20:32 < Neox_> In the map editor, if you embed this picture and you save the map, the client crashes http://www.nxcity.ovh/idlebg.png
20:33 < Neox_> the debug mod says that the problems comes from here : if(pPixelData[p*4+3] < 250) (editor.cpp)
20:34 < Neox_> I'm bad at client editing, could I have a fix for this please ? (I'll poste this in the forum actually, but I'm chatting here to get a quick answer)
23:37 <@matricks> in regards to the map editor
23:37 <@matricks> tiled -> teeworlds map converter? :D
