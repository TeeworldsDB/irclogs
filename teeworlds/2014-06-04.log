08:54 < SoMeRelaX> hi can someone help me about little code ?
08:58 <@matricks> probably
09:00 < SoMeRelaX> @matricks if you dont kick me
09:01 < SoMeRelaX> how can insert 'x' for example between playername like :
09:01 < SoMeRelaX> nickname : TEEWORLDS
09:01 < SoMeRelaX> result : TxEEWORLDS
09:01 <@matricks> ....
09:01 <@matricks> I've answered this before
09:02 < SoMeRelaX> no you dont you just kick me form irc
09:02 < Dunedune> you should try googling "insert character in string C", i think you would find what you need
09:02 <@matricks> I answered it, then I kicked
09:03 <@matricks> 08:37 <@matricks> GoJE_GrEEN: you mean like, str_format(aBuf, sizeof(aBuf), "player_name %cx%s", name[0], (const char *)(name + 1);
09:03 <@matricks> given that name ins't a empty string
09:05 < SoMeRelaX> sorry matricks
09:05 < SoMeRelaX> but can u explain it on my function ?
09:06 <@matricks> no, I don't have time, have to get to work
09:06 < SoMeRelaX> aha
09:06 < SoMeRelaX> ok anyway thank you
09:10 <@minus> SoMeRelaX: a beginners course in C should teach you how to insert something into a string
09:16 < SoMeRelaX> tnx minus
12:45 < JOKER_> anybody's there
14:48 < heinrich5991> who asked for that appdata stuff again?
14:51 <@matricks> email
14:51 <@matricks> Richard Hughes
16:28 <@minus> issue created?
18:13  * BotoX got his HE IPv6 T-Shirt in the mail today （ ´_ゝ`）
18:14 < EastByte> ^ nerd
18:14 < BotoX> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
19:16 < heinrich5991> matricks: can you give me the original email in order to create an issue?
19:18 <@matricks> sure, where should I email it to?
19:18 < heinrich5991> e.g. heinrich5991@gmail.com
19:19 <@matricks> done
19:19 < heinrich5991> thanks
21:47 < heinrich5991> does someone know specifics about pango?
21:47 < heinrich5991> (the gnome library)
21:48 < BotoX> mmmh, neat: https://i.imgur.com/OJnaF.jpg
21:49 < heinrich5991> indeed :)
21:53 < Edible> why does everyone like gnome
22:00 < BotoX> Because it is complete and has a lot of support, maybe?
22:00 < BotoX> I never really used it
22:01 < BotoX> Looks kinda nice, from what I've seen.
22:01 < BotoX> I'm using XFCE though
22:04 < BotoX> http://rowpics.com/htdocs/images/uploads/images/20_04_2013fgf4_38_19_.gif
22:04 < BotoX> There is no need to be upset ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
22:11 < heinrich5991> Edible: it seems to be the only library (pango, not gnome) in this area
22:16 < Edible> ah xfce, its what i'm trying to use :)
22:17 < Edible> X seems to use 15% of my CPU when I use xfce, so i'm looking for replacements
22:17 < Edible> i suppose i was using too many applets
22:18 < heinrich5991> Edible: if you haven't tried some yet, you might like some tiling window manager
22:21 < Edible> heinrich5991, changed to dwm, theres no notice of "battery running low" so will try lxde later. i dont wanna setup anything. i've gotten extremely lazy over the year
22:21 < heinrich5991> I'd suggest i3 :)
22:22 < Edible> I changed to i3 after my pc just died with no notice of battery, unfortunately it doesnt know that i'm using dvorak. so i have to reconfigure everything
22:22 < heinrich5991> oh meh
22:22 < Edible> so lxde next. hope it actually works this time
