14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> Hey oy,
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> 
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> don't you want to give Robyt3 a chance to mantain teeworlds, he's really activly pushing new prs and fixes stuff very quickly.
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> I think this is a great chance for teeworlds, and sometimes waiting too long just kills these chances. If you are so unsure about giving others access to teeworlds, you could maybe give him his own branch/repo and just see how it goes.
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> I know how frustrating rebasing can be, especially over a huge time span.
14:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> I'd really appreciate if you at least consider it, thanks.
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> +1
14:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Jupstar ✪: open an issue, oy won't read your message here
14:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> ok

19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ts懒散> me no smart
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> from a misogynistic perspective mantain might make sense.
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> emphasis on `man`
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> maintain just doesnt has the flow
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> mantain sounds better in my head xD
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Jupstar ✪> I am also ok with womantain
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> \*tain pls it’s 2022 there are way more than two genders -.-
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> chilltain
