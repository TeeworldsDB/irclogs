11:33 < Ryozuki> idk why, the mouse on the menus seems to have less sensitivity when going to the right and it feels very weird and annoying
11:42 <@Dune> as in, it's more sensitive when moving towards the left?
11:51 < Ryozuki> it feels like it moves faster to the left
11:52 < Ryozuki> idk if the problem is faster to the left or slower to the right
11:52 <@Dune> I mean, is it when your mouse is in a specific area, or moving in a specific directioon?
11:52 < Ryozuki> direction
11:52 < Ryozuki> it doesnt happen ingame
11:53 <@Dune> what's your inp_grab ?
11:53 < Ryozuki> 1
11:53 <@Dune> can you try with 0 and see if the problem happens igname?
11:54 < Ryozuki> oh
11:54 < Ryozuki> i changed it but i didnt know it didnt need a retart
11:54 < Ryozuki> with inp_grab 1 it doesnt happen
11:54 <@Dune> so inp_grab 0 causes that strange problem in the menus ?
11:54 < Ryozuki> for me yes
11:55 <@Dune> not the first person struggling with inp_grab 0: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1974
11:55 < Ryozuki> im on debian btw
11:55 <@Dune> hmm
11:55 < Ryozuki> maybe its a linux problem
11:56 <@Dune> sdl2 version?
11:56 <@heinrich5991> perhaps we should enable inp_grab on linux by default
11:56 <@heinrich5991> inp_grab 0 is giant hack anyway :P
11:56 <@Dune> linux doesn't usually have accel anyway, does it
11:56 < Ryozuki> libsdl2-dev/testing,now 2.0.8+dfsg1-6 amd64 [installed]
11:56 <@heinrich5991> definitely has for me
11:56 < Ryozuki> i disabled mouse accel
11:56 <@Dune> I think day was on linux too
11:57 < Ryozuki> entirely
11:57 < Ryozuki> cuz i dont like it
11:57 <@Dune> yeah, archlinux
11:57 <@Dune> so it has it by default on debian, Ryozuki ?
11:57 < Ryozuki> i think yes
11:57 < Ryozuki> i think it depends on the DE
11:57 < Ryozuki> or idk
11:57 < Ryozuki> but i disabled it
11:59 < Ryozuki> in my case gnome3.30 has acceleration profiles, i have it set to "flat"
12:20 < minus> (that's actually a libinput thing)
