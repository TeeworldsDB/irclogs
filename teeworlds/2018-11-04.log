10:49 < rand> hm, I only see my servers from server list, this is weird, where are the others ?
11:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> rand: 0.7?
11:14 < rand> yep
11:57 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> are tees genderless?
12:00 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> ...im not trying to provoke that special kind of discussion just wanted to know
12:03 < breton> i only see 500 servers, when usually it is 700+. So i think something is wrong somewhere
12:04 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> im getting 670
12:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <SilverMage-HUN> 506 here
12:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> armadillo: imo they are not generless
12:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what makes you think they have no gener?
12:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> gender*
12:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 458 servers for me
12:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://status.tw/?p=serverlist
12:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 441 servers here.. so looks like a master thing as always currently xd
12:14 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> chillerdragon so you would say twinbop is a female tee too? its just hard pinpoint what makes a tee female
12:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye twinbop is female
12:15 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> who else
12:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> redbopp or what ever the name was
12:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i am really bad with skin names
12:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cammostripes is male
12:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> greensward is gender neutral
12:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> depends on the color aswell i guess
12:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lets write an scientfici paper about tee genders. c:
12:17 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> thing is redbopp hardly looks female though
12:17 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> yeah would have to define gender first good luck with that
12:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ofcourse there are more than 2 genders... modern tee gender stuff.
12:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
12:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> We also have robots like atlas_by_whis and the tank. They are not part of the vanilla skin base but since they are part of ddnet client they are widly adopted.
12:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> imo redbopp is more female than pinky.
12:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Well pinky depends on the color.
12:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i feel pretty wrong saying there are coors that belong more to male and others that belong more to female.
12:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
12:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I guess that can differ with different cultural background or personal opinions idk.
12:21 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> could be
12:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> why are you even asking? xd
12:22 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> i guess the patterns on the face make it
12:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cammostripes is male i guess
12:23 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> i had an idea involving a full girl team
12:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the main artists of the skins would be a good ressource i guess
12:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> a team? like an ingame clan?
12:23 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> nah just a video concept
12:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i knew it! its for a video
12:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i love how much work and hilarious research you do for your videos ‚ù§
12:24 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> aww thanks
12:24 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> yeah i guess the last one got a bit too far with research on zikkie
12:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hehe
12:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i was almost mentioned in your video xd
12:26 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> yeah ik. initally it was the full sentence
12:26 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> people can get real mad tho when they expect to be mentioned i should stop the name dropping
12:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i was already censored in the original video by Zikkie so.... xd
12:28 < bridge> [freenode] <armadillo> yeah effective censoring. no one could tell who it was
12:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xxxd
12:52 < Dune_> hey rand
12:52 < Dune_> is the serverlist fixed for you?
16:35 < rand> no
16:35 < Dune_> weird :| mine looks fine
16:36 < rand> no
16:36 < rand> nvm
16:36 < rand> i'm a idiot
16:36 < rand> everything is fine
17:49 < breton> i am running into another fun problem
17:51 < breton> i am receiving udp packet from master server ip with SERVERBROWSE_FWOK
17:54 < breton> even before i went through REGISTERSTATE_QUERY_COUNT
17:56 < breton> so the process of selecting master servers and actually announcing myself is skipped at all. The server receives SERVERBROWSE_FWOK and does not try to do anything else.
17:57 < Learath2> I'm not really familiar with the entire masterserver protocol (heinrich5991 should know better) but I don't get how you are getting all these problems and no one else gets them
18:03 < breton> getting ddosed a lot. And some people don't want my server to be up.
18:03 < breton> or i just do a lot of stuff wrong
18:05 < Learath2> Are you messing with the registration code? I see no reason why the masterserver would randomly send you a FWOK without you responding to a FWCHECK nor do I see how it could send you a FWCHECK if you didn't register yet
18:05 < Learath2> maybe someone is spoofing the master ips and just flooding your server with fwok's...
18:05 < breton> i see no reason too. And i am almost sure that someone is spoofing master ips.
21:53 < Dune_> does anyone know who compiled the last binaries for mac?
21:53 < Dune_> heinrich5991?
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I compiled some and published them in a issue
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> What last binaries are you talking about?
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh by the way I am no longer able to build the current source on my Mac. Is anyone else encountering the same Problem? I have failed textures agian
22:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon 0.6.5?
22:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh no I compiled 0.7
22:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah, I see then
22:51 < Dune_> wow, two tees just killed each other at once with the hammer in survival :D
22:52 < Dune_> didn't know that was possible
