17:36 < Dune> âš™ nice UTF8 find :)
17:41 < Dune> I wonder if it should be incorporated in the ingame menus
17:43 < Oy> Sonix found it :D
17:44 < Oy> not sure about the ingame menu
17:45 < Oy> https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2630/index.htm this one is pretty common as setting symbol too
17:47 < Dune> I think you kinda expect to have a settings menu like https://i.imgur.com/T1mIW2M.png with that one
17:48 < Dune> is there any official stance on steam-specific features, by the way?
17:48 < Dune> (such as achievements)
17:50 < Oy> well, think the steam version was supposed to be like the one you download from the website, just another place for downloading, no additional features
17:50 < Oy> we could talk about it
17:50 < Dune> yeah, sounded like that to me
17:51 < Dune> I don't think it's good to have users need to go to Steam to enjoy some specific features
17:51 < Dune> But maybe if features like achievments are incorporated in Teeworlds, they could be integrated to Steam too
17:51 < Dune> (?)
17:58 < Oy> yeah
17:58 < Oy> dead island comes to my mind, that does it the same
17:59 < Dune> okay :)
18:06 < Dune> does this belong in the website doc? https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=communityweb
18:07 < Dune> minus: I suggest adding client_max_body_size 50M; to /etc/nginx/nginx.conf if you don't mind, since that is the limit set for attachments from privileged users on the forum
18:08 < Oy> hm, dunno. seems old
18:08 < Dune> yeah it does
18:08 < minus> Dune: sure
18:09 < Dune> alright, thx
18:09 < Dune> Oy: should probably have a brief "Contributing" page somewhere too
18:09 < minus> fwiw that went into /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/teeworlds.com though
18:10 < Dune> huh
18:12 < Oy> Dune: yeah could do that
18:12 < Dune> ok
18:15 < Oy> can probably grab these https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/graphs/contributors
18:20 < Dune> Ah yeah, that too
19:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> There should be a discussion about code-related tags. Issues before a certain point were systematically tagged, while now tagged seems to mean "valid".  Code-related was a thing from that time
19:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Should make those two things consistent somehow
19:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> One steam-specifyc feature, I would like to see is "Join to player", from steam friend list
20:49 < Oy> yeah, i usually tag stuff that is valid. the stuff that isn't probably needs some discussion/clarification
