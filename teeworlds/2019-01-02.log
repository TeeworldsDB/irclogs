10:32 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master d6cb666 oy: Merge pull request #1940 from Speedy-Consoles/master...
10:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> happy new year guys
12:30 <@Dune> hey ho
12:30 <@Dune> happy new year, Oy
12:30 <@Dune> would you mind clearing up why that wouldn't work? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1941#issuecomment-450818339
12:33 < Oy> well, the client has no clue which commands will be available
12:33 < Oy> and doesn't know when loading the available commands is finished
12:33 <@Dune> oh
12:34 <@Dune> so you can't delete commands at the end
12:34 < Oy> there's no end msg by the server
12:35 < Oy> already found the problem, will fix it later, so it's as fast as 0.6
12:35 <@Dune> oh, thanks :)
13:03 <@Dune> any clue how to make gametype icons support both types? check their size and only allow square and 1:3?
13:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Both types?
13:04 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1903
13:09 <@Dune> Transifex is seeing progress, by the way
13:09 <@Dune> We didn't add more strings recently, right
13:11 <@Dune> all major languages are >90% except turkish and chinese
13:14 <@heinrich5991> Learath2: ^? :)
13:16 < Oy> think there are some new ones
13:16 < Oy> also the game messages (join capture) changes because of the id right?
13:17 < Oy> about the gametype icons: yeah check the size
13:19 <@Dune_> those were all in 0.7.1?
13:21 < Oy> yeah
13:21 <@Dune_> so should be updated already
13:22 < Oy> but the change was after i think
13:22 < Oy> checking
13:23 <@Dune_> ho, russian still has "K" and "D" strings
13:23 <@Dune_> those aren't used anymore afaik
13:23 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/88622ec94d96b82920e79366b9c49b0e8b44f3be was 0.7.2
13:23 <@Dune_> ah i see, thx
13:26 <@heinrich5991> btw, for translation it's usually best if we don't have strings like str_format(Localize("%s has joined the %s team"), â€¦, Team ? Localize("blue") : Localize("red")), but instead str_format(Team ? Localize("%s has joined the blue team") : Localize("%s has joined the red team"), â€¦)
13:26 <@heinrich5991> I saw a few instances of that in the source code, might be better with the other version going forward
13:27 <@heinrich5991> (grammar works weirdly in many languages, and it's more intuitive to translate the whole string)
13:28 <@Dune_> ah yeah, that is true
13:28 <@Dune_> usually having several %s in a string is bad because languages tend to enjoy swapping things
13:29 <@heinrich5991> ah yes, that's also I wanted to fix
13:29 <@Dune_> (well if you fix that you fix the former issue)
13:29 <@heinrich5991> not really, you still have to translate five versions of "blue" for each language, depending on the context. it's easier to do it in one place for one string
13:30 <@Dune_> ah right
13:30 <@heinrich5991> e.g. for "Join blue" you need a different string (not sure if we use "Join %s" there)
13:30 <@Dune_> w edont
13:30 <@heinrich5991> but you get the point :)
13:30 <@Dune_> :)
13:33 <@Dune_> exporting the last strings
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Serbian has K D strings too
14:00 <@Dune_> it does?
14:00 <@Dune_> huh
14:01 <@Dune_> that is strange
14:04 <@Dune_> probably need to cleanup something before running script, will check when I'm back
14:04 <@Dune_> thanks for the report
15:48 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/fhqVj

15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @LordSk ^ :)
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Nice!
15:55 < Oy> twice as fast as it used to be in 0.6, but should be good
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yay
16:40 <@Dune_> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/7b21682fec2c89b395b4eafe7ff9ab98707a6043/src/game/client/components/scoreboard.cpp#L322-L327
16:40 <@Dune_> no shit K is still in the strings
16:41 <@Dune_> lesson: don't commit at 9am
16:58 < Oy> :P
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> damn im getting banned a lot lately ðŸ˜„

20:04 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master b6c2e2f oy: always show scoreboard within server info. don't hide bots in case no filter is selected. closes #1943
20:19 <@Dune> oh, so cmake is in
21:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I have downloaded latest updated, with cmake. I did `git submodule update --init --recursive`, to get maps and stuff. Also I used `python3 scripts/download.py  --arch=x86_64 --conf=release sdl freetype` to download libraries and includes.
21:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> CMake says: `You must install Freetype/SDL2 to compile the Teeworlds client`.
21:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> 
21:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Looks like CMake can't find libraries
21:11 <@heinrich5991> getting dependencies automatically is not done for cmake yet
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Don't understand? but files are in correct places
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> after all
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> should it work ?
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> or cmake looking for files in different paths
21:18 <@heinrich5991> different paths
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Okay, I fixed that
21:33 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] savander opened pull request #1944: fix paths to libs in CMakeLists.txt (master...patch-1) https://git.io/fhmes
21:35 < Oy> Savander that would probably make cross-compiling pretty hard
21:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> why?
21:36 < Oy> heinrich5991: can you build cross-compile all plattforms with cmake?
21:36 <@heinrich5991> yes
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> linux or mac, have different path to lib?
21:36 <@heinrich5991> but not with that PR merged, probably
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> okay, so just close it up. ðŸ˜‰
21:37 < Oy> Savander you have to check if you'Re building on windows, then u can use these paths ;)
21:37 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] savander closed pull request #1944: fix paths to libs in CMakeLists.txt (master...patch-1) https://git.io/fhmes
21:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> so linux, and mac have different paths?
21:38 < Oy> no
21:38 < Oy> well yeah
21:38 < Oy> for cross-compiling you need different paths for the libs u want to build for
21:38 < Oy> *with
21:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> i will not mess with it :PP  then
21:39 < Oy> when you'Re on linux and you want to build the windows binary you have to use the windows libs, same for mac - doesn't work if it just looks in 1 path then
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> shouldn't download script, download libs to other/<lib>/<os_name>/lib/<target_bit>
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> ?
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> then?
21:41 < Oy> then actual working directories wouldn't work/update anymore
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> how it was before, i remember that it was like: "other/sdl/windows/??"
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> and "other/sdl/include"
21:43 < Oy> other/sdl/lib/32 other/sdl/include - like when u unpack the official sdl archive u download
21:44 < Oy> other/sdl/lib/x86 other/sdl/include - like when u unpack the official sdl archive u download
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> hmm, im confused then. Maybe I'll leave it
21:47 < Oy> well, with the download script we could actually use the cmake path and then just rely on people having internet access when building
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> I see, bam downloads automatically SDL nad Freetype
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> if doesn't exists
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Have you tried to build tw with bam after that update? with auto-downloaded libs ?
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> cause i have linking error
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> nevermind. Forgot
22:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> or no, why i said that. ðŸ˜„  I'm a bit nervous today, sorry. 
22:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> So, The there's at least one thing.
22:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> bam compiled with CL, using compiler=cl on teeworlds compiling
22:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> it can't download libs because of : `duownload.py: error: argument --arch: invalid choice: 'unknown'`
22:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> also, i can't specify arch because: Cross compiling is unsupported on Windows.
22:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> the "unknow" arch, is set up automatically
22:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Gettimng a bunch of automated mails about fail compil because of immintrin.h
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Should disable the code or something at least
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> with default compiler, "gcc", arch=x86. It downloads libs but there's linking error: https://pastebin.com/29U9nWBy
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> If anyone else can test, it would be great ðŸ˜‰
22:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> Pure teeworlds-master clone
22:12 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1945: Remove unportable <immintr.h> and `_mm_pause` function (master...pr_remove_immintr) https://git.io/fhmfx
22:13 < Oy> which platforms report these problems? they probably can't run the client anyway
22:14 <@heinrich5991> e.g. arm
22:15 < Oy> yeah raspberry pi can't run the client
22:15 <@heinrich5991> huh, can't it?
22:15 < Oy> no
22:16 < Oy> have to update to opengl es
22:16 < Oy> then it can
22:16 < Oy> otherwise u just get 1-2 frames a second
22:17 <@heinrich5991> ah
22:18 <@heinrich5991> the thing that this instruction does is tell the CPU to relax its execution of this hyperthread
22:18 <@heinrich5991> that means it benefits the case where something else wants to do something with the second hyperthread on the same CPU
22:18 <@heinrich5991> otherwise it's still a spinloop. I think it's not worth the pain to keep
22:18 <@heinrich5991> we can of course guard it behind #if (intel processor)
22:20 < Oy> yeah use it for x86/x64 arch only
22:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> +1
22:38 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] heinrich5991 closed pull request #1945: Remove unportable <immintr.h> and `_mm_pause` function (master...pr_remove_immintr) https://git.io/fhmfx
22:38 <@heinrich5991> if you implement that, please also move it to src/base/system.c
22:43 < Oy> yeah, best place for it
22:55 < Oy> guess intel itanium doesn't support it too - not sure
