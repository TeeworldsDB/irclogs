02:48 <@heinrich5991> minus: can one still join the advent of code thing? :)
13:38 <@minus> heinrich5991: ofc
13:38 <@minus> heinrich5991: it's quite easy tho
13:38 <@minus> took me ~5 mins per thing
13:38 <@minus> with python, a lot of stuff can be done faster with grep apparently
14:12 <@heinrich5991> one of the things took me 20min+, because I put in two logic errors
14:44 <@heinrich5991> minus: the newest one looks a bit more tricky btw
14:45 <@heinrich5991> I considered doing it at 5AM, but then it looked so complicated
16:12 <@minus> i'll check it later
22:55 < rand> hello, i'm looking for building teeworlds 32bits on a 64bits, do you know how to (with bam) ?
23:12 <@minus> bam arch=x86 conf=release game
23:12 <@minus> should do the job if you have gcc-multilib installed
23:17 < rand> since i'm building 0.6, I did: bam arch=x86 conf=release server_release
23:17 < rand> but it produced 64bit binary :s
23:18 < rand> (gcc-multilib is installed)
23:18 <@minus> 0.6, hmmm
23:18 <@minus> no idea
23:18 <@minus> maybe search for "-m32" in the bam.lua
23:18 < rand> ok, thx
23:31 < rand> solved :)
