01:01 <@minus> you chose the least efficient solution to the problem
01:01 <@minus> getting teeworlds.com back online would be the most efficient solution. but that's out of my hands
01:02 <@heinrich5991> nah
01:02 <@heinrich5991> people will just come back with different IPs
01:02 <@heinrich5991> I just skipped two steps and made the channel +m
01:02 <@minus> fair
01:03  * minus mixes under the common people
01:03 <@heinrich5991> now you can't talk :)
01:03 <@heinrich5991> ah wait, I removed it already
01:04 < minus> ;)
01:04 <@heinrich5991> what's up with teeworlds.com?
01:04 < minus> looks like kottizen's everything has disappeared
01:04 <@heinrich5991> you have backups?
01:04 < minus> yes
01:04 <@heinrich5991> good
01:05 < minus> probably missing a day of content though
01:05 <@heinrich5991> then let's wait a couple of days
01:05 < minus> yup
01:05 < minus> if it's not coming back i'll probably rent a machine somewhere and throw teeworlds on there
01:06 <@heinrich5991> then we'll find out if the backup is any good ^^
01:07 < minus> =D
01:12 <@heinrich5991> night
01:13 < minus> good idea
21:59 < minus> update: outage is caused by a hardware failure; investigation is underway
