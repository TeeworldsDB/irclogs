14:23 < ZillyHuhn> These difficulty icons are kinda random or is it just me who has that feeling? Is anyone using them?
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's up to server owners to use them
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but yeah doesn't seem to work well
15:00 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> so, how do I compile teewordls on openbsd
15:00 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> are there any instructions?
15:00 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> I mean I already compiled it with no errors but I get:
15:00 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> ./teeworlds[1]: syntax error: `^G^R?^G^RP^G^Ra^G^Ro^G^R$D^G^R$\^G^Rï¿½^G^Rï¿½^G^Rï¿½^G^Rï¿½^G^Rï¿½^G^Rï¿½^G^Rï¿½^G^Rï¿½^G^R^L^H^R$^H^R:^H^RO^H^Rd^H^R{^H^R$P^H^Rï¿½^H^Rï¿½^H^Rï¿½^H^Rï¿½^H^Rï¿½^H^Rï¿½^H^Rï¿½^H^R^M' unexpected
15:11 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> this occurs both with make and gmake
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> wat
15:13 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> oh and ./teewordls_srv exits with ./teeworlds_srv[1]: syntax error: `(' unexpected
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> type `file teeworlds`
15:13 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> I think I'm missing something
15:13 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> teeworlds: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> how do you execute it?
15:13 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> teeworlds_srv: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what command do you use?
15:13 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> ./teewordls
15:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's all you type, that's the complete command line?
15:14 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> well yes I just run ./teeworlds
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> can you try `env ./teeworlds`?
15:16 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> it doesn't change anything
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> exactly the same error?
15:16 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> yep
15:17 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> the complete steps I made are: 1. download the 0.7.5 zip 2. extract it 3. mkdir ubild 4. cd build 5. cmake .. 6. gmake 7. ./teeworlds
15:17 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> should it works on other OSes right?
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> there has to be something wrong with your computer for these errors
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Why is it even reading an elf binary as some kind of script?
15:38 < rand> nobody expects the `(' error
15:41 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> yeah that's what I thought, there shouldn't even be a syntax error
15:41 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> well I guess Im on my own
15:42 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> I'll let you know if I can get it to work
15:43 < rand> try some thing like sh -c ./teeworlds, or build another binary to compare
15:45 < rand> > echo 'main() {}' | cc -x c - && ./a.out
15:51 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> https://paste.debian.net/1149939
15:54 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> (works on mac thought)
15:58 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> maybe, this is the right one https://paste.debian.net/1149943
16:00 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> oh dai raga rispondetegli
16:00 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> Ã¨ tutt'oggi che cerca di compilare teeworlds
16:00 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> dategli una mano
16:01 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> NO MA IO DICO
16:01 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> Nel corso della verifica scritta del 21/05/2020 svolta in sincro tramite videoconferenza, l'alunno passa il proprio elaborato ad un compagno per via telematica. BenchÃ¨ tale atto possa essere stato mosso da motivazioni comprensibili sul piano umano nei riguardi di un amico, si ritiene altresÃ¬ che questo comportamento sia gravemente sleale a
16:01 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> livello scolastico, soprattutto in considerazione del particolare momento e delle straordinarie modalitÃ  con cui si Ã¨ potuta svolgere l'attivitÃ  didattica in questo pentamestre, modalitÃ  che si sono fondate su un rafforzato patto di collaborazione, partecipazione e correttezza nei rapporti tra alunni e docenti.
16:01 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> QUESTO SI Ã¨ PRESO UNA BOTTA IN TESTA
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Floppy: english please
16:05 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> oh sorry
16:05 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> help lus3r
16:06 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> he is my friend
16:06 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> you understand me, yes?
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> `echo 'int main() {}' | cc -x c - && ./a.out`
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> try this, lus3r
16:06 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> come on
16:06 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> of course it doesnt report any error
16:07 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> the compiler works
16:08 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> niente questo qua non mi sembra informato
16:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't understand the problem, so I'm trying to find rule out wrong assumptions
16:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so that `./a.out` binary works without problems?
16:14 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> yes
16:17 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> has anyone tried to compile tw on openbsd recently btw? 'cause it compiles on mac, compiles on linux and I suspect that the issue is not my laptop but rather openbsd per se
16:18 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> Maybe I've messed it up though, I'll try later on a fresh installation
16:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't know, this might be a general problem with teeworlds on openbsd, yes
16:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but I really don't understand how the error can happenâ€¦
16:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> is it possible that you installed some cross compiler?
16:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> also can you do `ldd ./teeworlds`?
16:23 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> umh
16:24 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> https://paste.debian.net/1149950
16:24 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> at this point I may have done something wrong ..
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Yeah there is something seriously wrong with that binary
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> can you show me the output of `cmake ..`?
16:24 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> sure wait
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> you can also check dmesg, maybe the kernel outputs why it gave up on trying to load this elf file
16:27 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> https://paste.debian.net/1149951
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> `Target OS: 64bit` sounds a little wrong ðŸ˜„
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I wonder if that has an effect
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> shouldn'tâ„¢
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> as long as it's not using any bundled binary libraries, which it is not
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> can you show me the output of verbose make?
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> `gmake VERBOSE=1` should do it
16:31 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> doing it
16:34 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> https://paste.debian.net/1149953
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> also see if the kernel is leaving any reason as to why it doesn't want to load this binary
16:34 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> there's no clue in dmesg
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I wonder why `env ./teeworlds` still got the same error
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it shouldn't try to interpret it as a shell script by default using this
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so it should only execute it with `/bin/sh` if it has a shebang line
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I'd guess that depends on the kernels options though
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I distinctly remember coming across that while configuring the kernel
16:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> well idk what's wrong, can I have the ELF binary to take a look at?
16:37 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> sure
16:37 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> suuu
16:37 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> I dont know where to upload it though
16:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> is it too large to send on discord?
16:37 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> I donthave discord
16:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> oh true, forgot this is linked to irc for a sec ðŸ˜„
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> well I haven't used an upload site in a couple years, mediafire is bound to still be around
16:40 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> gofile.io
16:40 < bridge> [freenode] <Floppy> come on
16:45 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> https://ufile.io/7djcwxil
16:45 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> (I had to install firefox)
16:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Can you do readelf -h on a binary that works?
16:50 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> https://paste.debian.net/1149956
16:53 < bridge> [freenode] <lus3r> is 2.4M too small?
16:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> yeah I don't see the issue with this elf file
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the issue probably lies in the system
18:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> but why can he compile a simple binary and run it but not tw?
18:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we could try a simple binary also linking tw's libraries
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> is it possible to program a python client against teeworlds netcode?
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yes.
