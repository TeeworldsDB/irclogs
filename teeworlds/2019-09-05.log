18:14 <@Dune> hi Oy
18:15 <@Dune> regarding https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2214, should we keep the id:team:name format when not in debug?
18:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well its only 3 chars i guess its less confusing to use the same in debug and non debug
18:18 <@Dune> good point but it'd restore backwards compatibility
18:18 <@Dune> not sure if econ cares about console_output_level though
18:18 <@Dune> the system console sure doesn't
18:36 < Oy> Dune: yeah, would keep it the same when in debug or not
18:36 <@Dune> okay :)
18:37 <@Dune> the second bullet point is not feasible
18:37 <@Dune> `make the "shot" debug outputs only displayed when debug 1 is set
18:37 <@Dune> `
18:37 <@Dune> the console ignore the debug output lever
18:38 < Oy> check for debug and only print it then?
18:38 < Oy> like all the prediction errors
18:38 <@Dune> a bit hackish but works I guess
18:40 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L1450
18:40 <@Dune> ah I se
18:40 < Oy> we could also change the console_level_output behaviour to work for all consoles?
18:41 <@Dune> yeah, we could
18:41 <@Dune> not sure what the unforeseen side effects would be
18:41 < Oy> yeah, dunno what the reason was to not do it in the first place
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> seems to be a vanilla teeworlds issue, packaging on macOS into a .dmg file causes an error ```
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> [100%] Generating teeworlds-0.7.3-osx.dmg
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Error copying directory from "/Users/john/Desktop/teeworlds_original/other/sdl/mac/lib64/SDL2.framework" to "pack_teeworlds-0.7.3-osx_dmg/teeworlds.app/Contents/Frameworks/SDL2.framework".
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ```
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> could somone confirm pls.
18:44 < Oy> always use the make_release script to make the .dmg file - never had a problem there
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> cmake?
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or a python script?
18:44 <@Dune> the python script
18:45 < Oy> bam and then the python script
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> python, let's test ðŸ˜¦ .. the maybe remove it from cmake or use that script to bundle the cmake version?
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm using cmake
18:48 < Oy> probably works with cmake too, not sure about the paths though
18:56 < Oy> Dune: that "Score displayed in name plates" of the teecomp client might be useful for the official too?
18:57 <@Dune> maybe yeah Oy 
19:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> PLEASE OPTIONAL
19:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> What also would be cool: show client ids only for scoreboard
19:03 <@Dune> for? admin use?
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (or multiple commands, to set it for kill msg, ingame nameplate, etc)
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Its annoying to have that big box in the nameplate, but in Scoreboard it is nice and can be used for admins
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Well, and for the Score in nameplate: Bad idea imo, why do we have the scoreboard if we show everything in the nameplate
19:04 <@Dune> might want to have it enabled in the scoreboard when authed in rcon
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> No, not only
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Servers can use commands which use ids
19:05 <@Dune> not a big fan of making a command for every piece of code (at least in vanilla)
19:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> make an array
19:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> of 0 and 1's
19:05 <@Dune> then just enable ids globally
19:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> wow
19:06 <@Dune> it's a bit weird to have a server require you to use ids while not being logged in rcon, isn't it?
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 I was able on my macbook to create apps with bam/make_release.py and cmake/make package_dmg that compile and run fine witouth errors on my machine.
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I am still waiting for my test user to test my latest attempt ðŸ™‚
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Dune, there are tho (iF City for example)
19:07 <@Dune> :|
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> could you look into the .app folder and see, what's inside your framework folders, @ChillerDragon
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> And i am disliking scores in nameplates very much. Taking your argument you said for the name change: "You dont need to change", in this case check, "these information very often ingame"
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> same as in official release i think
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> from which folder does one execute the make_release.py script?
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ./
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm getting BS errors
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and run bam first
19:09 <@Dune> Names are used to identify people. I think it's legit to expect people not to change them in the middle of a game
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> run it with python3
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I do
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> bam release
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no debug
19:09 <@Dune> I don't use scores in nameplates. They shouldn't be enabled by default anyway :)
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what are the errors?
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune at least give a clientside option for that, so that servers can use it. Didnt you say you want to make teeworlds as mod friendly as possible?
19:10 <@Dune> you can already enable client IDs in vanilla teeworlds, fokkonaut
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> bam: target 'release' not found
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Dune i know?
19:10 <@Dune> conf=release, @jxsl13
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Dune, i mean name changing
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thx
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> only ever used bam for 0.6
19:11 <@Dune> apparently name changing was abused for some stuff. I wasn't there when it was removed, I couldn't tell you exactly
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> mh
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> We can disable name changing in vanilla tho
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I was wondering, nicks are being ltrimmed(skip_whitespace), does the whister stuff actually take into considertion, whether a player has whitespaces to the right side of their nick?
19:12 <@Dune> whister stuff, @jxsl13?
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> whisper
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ./whisper
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ./whisper nick<whitespace>
19:13 <@Dune> should work fine with that
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I used that variant now, getting errors, even tho the result seems to have been created.
19:15 <@Dune> then I imagine there is a bug with that
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> needs admin privileges
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it works without errors the make_release
19:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> so the make_release script sems to put the right frameworks / shared libs into the frameworks library
19:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13>

19:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> cmake rip :'C
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> thats what i like about having two build systems. Only one has to work for you. It might be more work to maintain but more troubleshoot options for individuals.
19:23 <@Dune> @ChillerDragon: that's a bit fallacious :P
19:23 <@Dune> the reason why we have a bunch of issues and only one works might be because we have two build systems
19:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> cmake is a standard uild system, which can be used with tons of libraries right off th ebat. it makes sense to keep it maintained. and it was a good decision to use it. and you can find a lot of stuff online for cmake, but not for bam.
19:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> build*
19:25 <@Dune> oh yeah of course, it's good to have cmake :) a lot of people already are familiar with that
19:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might take a while, until both systems are interchangable
19:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the make_release.py opens a lot of file handlers/descriptors without closing them.
20:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @Dune  http://www.mediafire.com/file/ukkxa4b4h1wf6mt/teecomp-0.7.3-osx.dmg.zip/file
20:03 <@Dune> oh, thank you @jxsl13 :)
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> file's online for 14 days
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I updated https://github.com/dune-jr/teeworlds/releases
20:42 < Oy> Dune: u have to remove that line https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2215/files#diff-fcc0cc87472883c0ac01be250a1135b1R566
20:46 <@Dune> oh, but that should just be a warning
20:47 <@Dune> hm, you'd think those warnings would be enabled by default :|
20:48 < Oy> warnings are treated as errors
20:48 <@Dune> ah, CI configuration
21:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @Dune  http://www.mediafire.com/file/do49mtbi014ykcp/teeworlds-gamer-5.4-osx.dmg/file

21:29 <@Dune> thanks again :)
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> np
21:44 <@Dune> @jxsl13 the patch you sent is strange though, it adds data/ to cmakefiles
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the folder only?
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's to remove those warnings.
21:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> single folders shoul dnot be in there
21:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> only file paths.
21:46 <@Dune> the patch has stuff like +  "data/ui/menuimages/local_server.png"
21:47 <@Dune> I think just +  "ui/menuimages/demos.png" is enough
21:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lemme check that
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the whole data stuff is weirdly a folder in my datasrc and not actually existing in the repo.
22:53 <@Dune> maybe you compiled some 0.6 stuff?
