01:12 < daey> my teeworlds developed the same issue that I had with cs:go under linux. slow mouse movements to specific directions are not registered
01:13 < daey> in cs:go the fix is simple. simply set the mouse input to 'RAW'
01:13 < daey> does teeworlds have such a feature?
03:14 < Edible> change to windows
03:14 < Edible> linux sucks for gaming
03:14 < Edible> does this even need to be said?
05:02 <+Socialdarwinist> But Windows is illegal in the European Union, blatantly breaching data privacy rights. Canâ€™t be recommended. Windows is thus only supported for legacy reasons. The future belongs to Linux.
08:39 < eeeee> i agree. have heard this year is gonna be the year of linux desktop.
09:10 <@minus> daey: I have that when using the touchpad, but I'm not aware of a fix
09:10 <@minus> Year of the Wayland Desktop even, eeeee
09:22 < eeeee> good point, EU should make X11 illegal as well
09:25 <+matricks> so we can faster get to wayland?
09:27 < eeeee> in soviet eu wayland get to YOU
13:14 < daey> minus: and so my teeworlds career ends Q_Q Rip Lord Masterking 2009-2017 
13:15 < daey> oh i solved it
13:15 <+Learath2> :D
13:15 < daey> turning on v-sync makes it go away
13:15 < daey> xD
15:47 < Stitch626> you could use AllTheHaxx client which supports SDL2 and RAW mouse input ^^
18:19 <+deen> Stitch626: how to use raw mouse input?
18:21 <+deen> Ah, that's just what we call "old mouse mode" in DDNet I guess
