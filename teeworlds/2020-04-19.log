10:07 < ChillerDragon> Yo Oy can we get an option to skip chat rendering? So one can turn off all chat without losing messages.
10:08 < ChillerDragon> Currently its kinda hard to make videos or screenshots because server messages can not be hidden.
10:12 < Oy> isn't there already a feature to disable all chat messages?
10:13 < ChillerDragon> no there is a option to not recieve chat messages but that does not affect server messages. And not recieving is information that is lost.
10:14 < ChillerDragon> Just skipping the render but keeping the chat history ready to read would be better. Also it should hide all chat.
10:15 < Oy> yeah sure
10:15 < ChillerDragon> So change that or additional option?
10:45 < Oy> an option would probably the better choice
10:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Player and tee tabs should be merged imo
10:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> that country selector takes up too much space for nothing
11:11 < ChillerDragon> Oy I would just skip the rendering but still playback sound so you know you got a message or should that be muted as well?
11:19 < ChillerDragon> console command descriptions are not localized right?
11:25  * trafilaw slaps ChillerDragon around a bit with a large fishbot
11:35 < Oy> yeah, these could be merged. then we'd have a free tab for ui/client settings
11:35 < Oy> ChillerDragon: should be like the other chat messages
11:35 < Oy> settings
11:36 < ChillerDragon> merge what?
11:37 < ChillerDragon> ah ye what Sonix said ye
11:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> ChillerDragon: could you come on, its important
11:44 < ChillerDragon> i am on i sent u a private message
11:44 < ChillerDragon> rq
11:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Trafalgar Law> I got nothing
13:02 < IRLDune> We should have a  counter somewhere 
13:02 < IRLDune> Days without a request for a new chat option
13:03 < IRLDune> @Sonix that's a great idea, we really need some space
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I prefer the "days wihtout people getting tilted" counter
13:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Is there any way to prefix server side demos to see where they actually come from :o? (like multiple servers recording, dumping into same directory)
13:55 < Oy> just use a different save directory for each server
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm using a centralized directory, same as with logs
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> do we know what was actually fixed for OSX? I didn't follow the whole thing
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> to have shared partial server configs and stuff, I updated the issue
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> to see how it looks like
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It seems like windowed mode can have several resolutions now(?)
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> looking at the demo size, Teehistorian ‚ù§Ô∏è
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (still small compared to actual videos, tho)
14:08 < Oy> Dune: the accent menu doesn't show up anymore on osx
14:08 < Oy> for the several resolution thing a sdl release is needed i think
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah, https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2522 didn't end up being merged
14:13 < Oy> there wasn't a sdl release since then
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> wait, we now render spectator HUD when game is paused? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2408 @fokkonaut
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> doesn't that mean players can look around during, say, a paused vanilla game?
14:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no, thats meant for /pause. So when the player is in Team spectators, the local character is not set.
14:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> look
14:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> This does not impact vanilla pauses?
14:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> use vanilla 0.7.4 and go on abddrace server and say /pause, while your viewpos is nearby your character it will render hearts, ammo, and not the spectator hud. When you leave your tee (due to network clipping) it is normal. Try the same with F-Client or latest master and the spec HUD is also while your tee is nearby
14:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it does not impact vanilla, because such a situation cant happen in vanilla (your local character + specinfo)
14:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> specinfo is an object of CPlayer::Snap, which gets sent while you are spectator (or in ddrace /pause)
15:04 < Dune> glad to see the none theme are fixed
15:04 < Dune> is*
15:05 < Dune> should we announce anything on Steam even
15:06 < Oy> hm dunno, not much to show
15:06 < Dune> Learath2: what about https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2575 ? Oy is around and redix might be
15:06 < Dune> Yeah and I doubt anyone uses Steam to host servers
15:07 < Dune> I put up the changelog
15:07 < Dune> I parse PRs for that, so I might have missed some of the things you did on your own, Oy
15:07 < Oy> blargh that command stuff again, thought everything was fixed :)
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Okay, do you think it would be okay to not include this fallback? the command stuff is only used by mods and the two mods that we discovered using it are both willing to just fix it themselves
15:08 < Oy> what's the fallback for?
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The command feature was initially released with a pretty meh implementation in 0.7.4
15:09 < Dune> (It existed before, but only client-side)
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The field is named "arguments" but the client was sending the entire chat line which the couple mods relied on
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Also in 0.7.4 the argument line was sent but never even used
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The fallback ignores the argument list like 0.7.4
15:10 < Oy> the whole thing is only used by mods anyway right?
15:10 < Dune> server-side commands, yeah
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Yes, well unless vanilla would like some server-side commands in the future
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> but it hasn't been used by vanilla yet
15:12 < Oy> yeah, so as long as the current client doesn't break, hangs whatever when using the commands on an old server
15:12 < Oy> i'd say make it work. people have to fix there servers
15:12 < Oy> so skip the fallback
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Okay, instead of a fallback, lets just clear the chat on a parsing failure and maybe add an error indication in the future?
15:14 < Oy> yeah, sounds good
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Are you getting ready for a 0.7.5 btw?
15:15 < Oy> yeah
15:15 < Dune> writing the stuff
15:15 < Oy> today right Dune?
15:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Make sure you build the osx release with an old version of the sdk or it won't work on catalina (not without a master SDL)
15:16 < Dune> yes Oy
15:16 < Oy> yeah, my mac is pretty old
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I got the patch into SDL but it wasn't released yet
15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> btw we've been building ddnet on a single linux machine for a while and it's been pretty stable so far, you might want to consider doing cross builds too
15:34 < Learath2> hm, it's not trivial to detect how the failure in parsing occured, do you think maybe we should just not even register commands with malformed argument lists?
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> throw string "yeet";
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Learath2: sounds like a good idea
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'd guess devs would want a properly formated list, so assert crash üòÆ
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> to find error fast :0?
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is bridge dead?
17:32 < ChillerDragon> u
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> alive
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> where is the 2 hours of conversation
17:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :( discord ded
17:33 < ChillerDragon> uninstall discord :p
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no u
18:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Learath2 will you execute that idea?
18:08 < Learath2> yes, just a minute
18:08 < Learath2> it's easy to come up with the regex to verify argument lines, but C string operations are not always easy to get right, just testing it before pushing
18:31 < Oy> that's one last thing that has to be added for 0.7.5
18:32 < Oy> anyone here botted up a linux or mac? and could quickly test sth?
18:32 < Oy> *booted
18:38 < Learath2> I'm on mac
18:44 < Oy> could you start teeworlds via terminal with a path, so not on your cwd
18:44 < Oy> and check if it finds the images and stuff
18:48 < Learath2> Oy: A dmg packed version or not?
18:53 < Learath2> a version I build finds the data just fine
18:57 < Learath2> I pushed the fix but this whole feature did a number on my self confidence so I keep feeling unsure
19:01 < Learath2> oh you could maybe get #2464 in, its simple enough
20:54 < Oy> Dune: if you want you can test the command thing :)
20:54 < Oy> anything else that needs to be fixed?
21:29 < Dune> no
21:29 < Dune> did anything change wrt the Learath PR?
21:31 < Dune> Learath2: thanks for all the iterations and the testing :)
21:32 < Dune> looks like we finally reached a satisfying solution
21:32 < Learath2> Thanks for your patience, that was very painful
21:33 < Oy> yeah, looks good :)
21:34 < Dune> getting my linux dinosaur up
21:42 < Dune> Oy: I'll point to the commit that fixes the exploit
21:43 < Oy> ok
21:52 < Oy> the ddrace servers on top have some problems. get thousands of "invalidated index" msg's
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> with debug on?
21:59 < Oy> yeah
22:01 < Learath2> its extended netobjects
22:03 < Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/issues/1643
22:05 < Dune> we can tag the release?
22:05 < Dune> ah, nvm, translations
22:05 < Dune> forgot
22:06 < Learath2> you could maybe output the debug message once for every type of unknown object? you wouldnt need to get ddrace specific or do the extended netobjects patch, but it'd fix the issue with thousands of log messages
22:10 < Oy> Dune: yeah :)
22:11 < Oy> Learath2: yeah, happen just with debug on, so not that urgent ;)
22:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Oy: that's harmless then, the client tags all the netobjs it doesn't know
22:14 < Oy> @heinrich5991 yeah, just lags
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Oy: that's kinda the fault of the dbg message. maybe we can drop it
22:16 < Dune> checking strings sanity
22:17 < Dune> polish has issues
22:17 < Oy> @heinrich5991 probably need that msgs just for testing
22:17 < Oy> oh
22:20 < Dune> languages updated
22:21 < Dune> (polish fixed)
22:22 < Oy> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=125608#p125608 2nd paraghragh: add a "that" between update and aims
22:22 < Dune> thanks
22:34 < Dune> preparing steam
22:37 < Oy> good :)
22:39 < Dune> can we tag, Oy?
22:39 < Dune> ah well there's a commit
22:42 < Oy> tag will be added automatically when the github release is published
22:42 < Learath2> Dune: how do you gather strings to translate from the source?
22:42 < Dune> Learath2: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-translation/wiki
22:44 < Learath2> There are Localize(.*) in comments, you seem to be picking those up too
22:44 < Dune> ah, I misread, sorry
22:44 < Dune> we use the convert_l10.py script
22:44 < Dune> in scripts/
22:44 < Learath2> e.g. "Show chat messages from:"
22:44 < Dune> actually, it's explained in the link I sent you
22:45 < Learath2> hmm, that seems like a pretty naive grep of the source, which can't check whether the localize happens in a comment or not
22:45 < Dune> yes
22:45 < Dune> I like how steamcmd sets the console window title to my username and password
22:45 < Learath2> LOL
22:46 < Learath2> take a screenshot and you are fucked
22:46 < Dune> to be fair there is steam guard for new locations/computers
22:46 < Learath2> maybe we should do convert_l10.py with libclang if available?
22:46 < Dune> Localize in comments is a good thing
22:47 < Dune> sometimes we do loops and comment with a bunch of localize
22:47 < Dune> see menus_browser.cpp
22:47 < Learath2> ah, well in the above case you seem to have a colon in the comments but no colon outside the comments so that duplicates the string
22:47 < Learath2> might want to fix that
22:48 < Learath2> not that it's important at all, just saw it and wanted to investigate why it happened
22:48 < Oy> Dune: win, mac and src up
22:48 < Dune> uploading x86 64, building x86
22:52 < Dune> getting maps from master submodule btw
22:53 < Oy> yeah
22:54 < Dune> I cannot start the x86 binaries on my 64-bit linux, I think that's normal
22:55 < Dune> downloading win&mac for steam
22:58 < Learath2> want me to give the mac release a try? you said you were on an older mac Oy and Catalina can get quite weird
22:58 < Dune> you have steam on your mac, Learath2?
22:58 < Learath2> yeah
22:58 < Dune> so you can test two things at once :)
22:59 < Oy> yeah, good :)
22:59 < Dune> we only upload win32 to steam iirc
23:00 < Oy> ah ok
23:00 < Dune> (I mean, not win64)
23:00 < Dune> oh, it's that time of the year when I re-learn to unzip a .dmg
23:01 < Oy> :D
23:01 < Oy> we should release more often :)
23:02 < Learath2> it's trivial with dmgtools
23:04 < Dune> https://xkcd.com/1168/
23:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> üòÑ
23:07 < Learath2> ah you aren't crossbuilding so you probably don't have dmgtools installed, I think it was libdmg-hfsplus that provides the dmg packer/unpacker
23:08 < Learath2> atleast that's what we use to pack ddnet dmgs
23:12 < rand> yeah, $ bsdtar xf random_file # works most of the time
23:12 < Dune> grr steamcmd doesn't even implement ls
23:17 < Dune> building steam
23:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Dune: 7z x a.dmg
23:18 < Dune> yeah, did just that @heinrich5991 :)
23:18 < Dune> thanks
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> 7z extracts everything
23:19 < Learath2> I wonder if 7z can do all the features of dmg
23:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no, not create
23:23 < Dune> Learath2: pm'd you a beta test key for steam/osx
23:28 < Dune> heinrich5991: we could revert the video on the frontpage
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> sure
23:29 < Dune> steam done, though no news
23:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> front page updated
23:31 < Dune> that's not the one I remember? :D  maybe I remember wrong
23:32 < Dune> Learath2: is it working?
23:32 < Learath2> downloading rn, turkey isn't known for it's amazing internet :P
23:32 < Learath2> (there was a steam update before this too)
23:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> Dune: which one do you remember?
23:33 < Learath2> Dune: doesn't work
23:33 < Dune> derp, what fails?
23:34 < Learath2> can't find datadir
23:34 < Dune> ah
23:34 < Oy> grr
23:34 < Dune> could be my fault
23:34 < Dune> Learath2: can you find the data dir?
23:35 < Learath2> well datadir seems to be @executable_path/..
23:37 < Dune> okay it is
23:38 < Learath2> fwiw, in the previous build you seem to ship a storage.cfg AND datadir is @executable_path/data
23:39 < Learath2> which is in the searchlist because argv[0] is checked
23:39 < Dune> reuploading
23:41 < Dune> Learath2: please update and test again
23:42 < Learath2> works great
23:42 < Oy> \o/
23:43 < Learath2> well, seems to have some trouble grabbing the mouse but that's been there since we first went to sdl2 :P
23:43 < Learath2> I'm guessing it's another sdl bug
23:43 < Oy> there're lots of them...
23:43 < Dune> \o/
23:44 < Oy> what next?
23:44 < Oy> push buttons?
23:44 < Dune> ship it!
23:44 < Oy> github done
23:45 < Dune> teeworlds.com now
23:45 < Learath2> let me try the dmg build too, rpaths can become an issue with bundles
23:46 < Dune> all done
23:47 < Oy> great :)
23:47 < Learath2> works fine aswell, \o/
23:48 < Learath2> that storage.cfg you are shipping in the dmg is pretty much ignored btw
23:49 < Oy> yeah, have to look into that with the other datadir detection stuff
23:50 < Learath2> not very advisable to reach outside of your bundle in the macOS world iirc
23:53 < Learath2> especially given the bundle is supposed to be installed into Applications, I think storage.cfg either belongs in the bundle or in appdir
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `+ Render spectator HUD when game is paused`
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> wrong
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> /paused in ddrace has nothing to do with game being paused
23:56 < Dune> right, how would you describe it then @fokkonaut ?
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> just a fix, not worth mentioning
23:57 < Dune> this changelog mentions a lot of fixes, this is mostly a fixing release :)
23:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well, it only affects mods, so idk
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it was fixed in F-Client anyways (guess Zilly also applied it)
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `+ Rename dump_binds to binds, tune_dump to tunes`
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> binds is clientside
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but listed under **server**
23:59 < Dune> edited, thanks
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> tunes is serverside tho
