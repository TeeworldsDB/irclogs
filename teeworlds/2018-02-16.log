14:05 <@heinrich5991> bridge does not send messages from discord to IRC anymore, for now
14:06 <@heinrich5991> if that works correctly
14:06 <@heinrich5991> yup, does
20:15 <@minus> heads up on the forum: registrations are dead
20:16 <@minus> changed the mail server to sendgrid, which rejected the login, so i set it back to mine again and it doesn't work anymore either :/
20:47 <@minus> we're good again
20:51 <@matricks> btw, I just changed my email from kolabnow to protonmail
20:51 <@matricks> protonmail so far is really nice
20:58 <@minus> didn't you already say that?
20:58 <@matricks> a good thing can be said twice
