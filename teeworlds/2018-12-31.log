02:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> can someone help me to get my 0.7 beta mod to 0.7.2?
13:13 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] heinrich5991 closed pull request #1395: HTTP master server list proof-of-concept (0.6...http_master) https://git.io/vZ3M8
14:22 < Zeta-Hoernchen> Dune: i found the relevant commit for the strange sound panning
14:22 < Zeta-Hoernchen> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/d1ee52c372
14:22 <@Dune> oh nice
14:22 <@Dune> should post that in https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1939 :)
14:23 < Zeta-Hoernchen> The new computations don't make much sense
14:23 < Zeta-Hoernchen> Oh, there is an issue, nice
14:23 < Zeta-Hoernchen> Thank you ;)
16:01 < TeeSlayer> how can I tell teeworlds to choose a random spawn location? (map editor)
16:08 <@heinrich5991> you can't
16:09 <@heinrich5991> it always chooses the spawn location that is the furthest away from all the other tees
16:09 <@heinrich5991> (with some modification for friends vs enemies for team games)
16:09 <@heinrich5991> you'd need to modify the source code for this
16:17 < TeeSlayer> mh kay
16:18 < TeeSlayer> another thing: is it somehow possible to specify the width/height with the keyboard? (or do 1 step at a time)
16:19 < TeeSlayer> sometimes I can't really hit the number I want to have
16:19 < TeeSlayer> it's frustrating^^
16:19 < TeeSlayer> nvm, got it
16:19 < TeeSlayer> shift
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Well shift is something but enterting a number manually would be great
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> espcecially for envelopes
16:28 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Speedy-Consoles opened pull request #1940: Fix audio panning (master...master) https://git.io/fhtmR
17:42 < TeeSlayer> have you guys thought of a solution for the server name not being displayed in full length in the server browser? there's a button to the right, but I guess most people won't press it
17:43 < TeeSlayer> maybe make it scroll when you hover/select?
17:43 <@Dune> I think the character limit is intended to be variable
17:44 <@Dune> doesn't it change depending on your resolution?
17:44 < TeeSlayer> no, I've tried that yesterday
17:44 <@Dune> well it changes depending on whether you have the tab on the right or not at least
17:44 < TeeSlayer> oh it is
17:45 < TeeSlayer> 640 gives me more characters than 1920x1200^^
17:45 < TeeSlayer> since it's longer I assume
17:45 <@Dune> 640 what
17:45 < TeeSlayer> x480
17:52 < TeeSlayer> my problem is that I want to indicate that only X players are allowed on the server, while allowing 64 clients
17:53 < TeeSlayer> and that is too much^^
17:53 < TeeSlayer> for the server name
17:53 <@Dune> There is already a count players toggle
17:53 <@Dune> maybe the UI for that should be improved
17:53 < TeeSlayer> ah
17:54 < TeeSlayer> maybe give it a special color once it reaches player_slots?
17:54 <@Dune> I think there should be an indicator, yes
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> happy new year! @all
22:10 < Teeworlds> [documentation] Dune-jr pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fht4J
22:10 < Teeworlds> documentation/master 1937ba2 Jordy Ruiz: Update forum_rules.md
22:53 <@Dune> minus: if you're not celebrating, is it possible to run touch teeworlds.com/images/badge_artist.png; chmod g+w teeworlds.com/images/badge* ?
22:54 < minus> why do you want to destroy things
22:55 <@Dune> Zatline is updating badges
22:56 < minus> i can also you superuser permissions if you promise not to break things
22:56 < minus> unless that's just a one-off thing and you don't really need it
22:56 <@Dune> I can't promise to prevent myself from breaking things, so it's best not to
22:57 < minus> =D
22:57 < minus> g+w wouldn't do you any good though
22:57 <@Dune> wouldn't?
22:57 < minus> you're not a member of www-data
22:57 <@Dune> oh
22:59 <@Dune> I assume the code for the forum configs is in forum/, which I do not have read access to
23:00 < minus> you mean the badge selection code?
23:01 <@Dune> yeah
23:01 < minus> yeah, it's an extension
23:01 <@Dune> I see
23:01 < minus> written by matricks, probably 10 years ago
23:02 <@Dune> having a swiss knife guy sure is handy
23:06 <@Dune> if you want a transparent placeholder to update the extension: http://puu.sh/CpOwG/4a3f4649da.png
23:06 < minus> >BB Code Blocker
23:06 < minus> >Created by m!nus
23:06 < minus> wat
23:07 <@Dune> Blocker?
23:07 < minus> >Disables BB Code and URLs for new users
23:07 < minus> i don't remember any of this
23:07 <@Dune> i don't think it's working either
23:08 < minus> it's disabled
23:12 < minus> well, let me know when you want shit updated then
23:15 <@Dune> alright, thanks :) (or just g+w the images folder?)
23:26 < minus> doesn't help if you need to modify the extension
23:33 <@Dune> you can modify it now?
23:34 < minus> fun fact: even the owner has no write permissions
23:35 < minus> Dune: done, and added you to the group
23:35 <@Dune> thx
