14:59 < MuLTIII> @TeeSlayer need your help
20:45 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 2 commits to branch master: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/compare/6cedf1fbd15d...142aefb9fd2c
20:45 < Teeworlds>  â€¢ oy (d47bec9): use the reset focus for edit boxes in the editor too
20:45 < Teeworlds>  â€¢ oy (e12de8f): Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
20:45 < Oy> oh :)
20:45 <@Dune>  :0
20:49 < Assa> Dune, are you there?
20:49 <@Dune> yes
20:51 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 commit to branch master: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/compare/142aefb9fd2c...ca71df686727
20:51 < Teeworlds>  â€¢ Fudgyking (1107783): Dont show chat when loading map
20:52 < Assa> Dune, do you know any way to predict movement in character cpp? I think my pullrequest would break it if you consider collision with other tees
20:53 <@Dune> I don't know about that, I would have to look into it
20:53 < Assa> I think I have too much freetime >.<
20:54 <@Dune> that's cool! :P
20:54 <@Dune> I alternate between way too much and way too little
20:56 < Assa> I think we have to simulate collisions with maptiles (solids), collision with deathtiles and collisions with other Tees at the same time
20:56 <@Dune> just find the first impact with a death tile and the first impact with a solid tile I guess?
20:57 < Assa> what if you hit another player before you hit the deathtile?
20:57 <@Dune> guess your course is deviated right?
21:00 < Assa> if you model collisions with other players first, you may hit a player after a deathtile first, thus bouncing off of him and not hitting the deathtile - I managed to pull this off in my testing
21:01 < Assa> If you don't handle collisions with other players first, a Deathtile would kill you even if another player would stop your movement
21:03 < Oy> this isn't done all together right now
21:05 < Assa> @Oy talking about issue #1936 and my pull request
21:05 < Oy> yeah
21:06 < Oy> here you do the player collision https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L529
21:06 < Oy> then you check for death tile https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L532
21:06 < Oy> and when all entities did their ticks u move and do ollision checks https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/character.cpp#L561
21:08 < Assa> to resolve issue #1936, you have to check between the current position of the Tee and the future position of a Tee, if a deathtile hit occures
21:09 < Oy> yeah
21:09 < Oy> might be best to do it with the wall collision check
21:09 < Assa> Thats why i moved it to gamecore move()
21:10 < Oy> movebox in collision.cpp
21:10 < Oy> sounds logical
21:15 < Assa> I did it with DDA and as I see i reinvented the wheel :o
21:16 <@Dune> all this collision code looks a bit confusing to me, gj for working it out :p
21:17 < Assa> The wrong character placement of the settings icon annoys me more :p
21:18 <@Dune> that looks so unimportant to me :D
21:19 < Assa> Thats why my first pull request is on the Deathtile skip - its not so important and i can experiment a bit
21:20 <@Dune> imo the settings icon is less important than the game physics :D
21:21 < Assa> i wanted to do a pull request for the icon, too. But i simply couldn't find any errors
21:21 < Assa> I really think the character width is falsly calulated by the font
21:22 <@Dune> it's a difficult one yeah
21:23 <@Dune> TextEx has an issue
21:25 < Assa> i debuged it, glyphnumber was really 1 and charcount was 3, m_X of the cursor was just set 1 time (for the one glyph) and was calculated by Size*(AdvanceX+Kerning), ther Kerning was 0 btw
21:26 < Assa> To correct: Kerning*Scale
21:49 < Assa> are there any Teeworlds code conventions to default variables?
21:50 <@heinrich5991> what do you mean, default variables?
21:50 <@heinrich5991> default parameters?
21:50 < Assa> int doStuff(int a, int b, int c=1337);
21:50 < Assa> yes, default parameters
21:50 <@heinrich5991> I don't know of any conventions regarding that
21:52 < Oy> no
21:53 < Oy> only stuff that's listed here https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/blob/master/nomenclature.md
21:53 <@heinrich5991> Dune: can you make your say something? â€” theoretically, the bridge should ignore it now
21:53 <@heinrich5991> *can you make your bot say something
21:55 < Assa> okay, thank you oy ^.^
21:57 < Assa> I accidantly made quicksand in teeworlds xD
22:06 <@Dune> heinrich5991, that's cool, but no I don't really have fake packets to test
22:07 < Assa> @Oy @Dune, i finished a way better shorter readable solutions to the deathtile problem, how huge are deathtiles (how big should i set Size for TestBox?)?
22:07 <@Dune> strangely enough I can send text from out of the channel but he can't (he's refused somehow), so I guess there is a banlist or something?
22:07 <@Dune> also I think you (mistakenly?) selected issues
22:08 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 commit to branch master: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/compare/ca71df686727...8abd41a65791
22:08 < Teeworlds>  â€¢ oy (67e2f3f): adjusted the x offset for font chars a bit to fix a positive rendering displacement. closes #2103
22:08 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed issue #2103: Settings icon is not centered https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2103
22:08 < Assa> and thanks oy xD
22:09 < Oy> well, if sth looks fishy now. let me know :)
22:10 < Oy> Assa: deathtiles have the same size as normal tiles
22:10 <@Dune> heinrich5991, you can resend a webhook packet actually from the github/webhook page
22:10 <@Dune> if you want to test
22:11 <@Dune> Assa, I have no idea really, this isn't my area of expertise :P
22:11 <@Dune> sorry
22:12 <@heinrich5991> no, deathtiles are slightly smaller than normal tiles
22:12 < Assa> @heinrich is right
22:12 <@heinrich5991> you can sit on the edge next to a death tile
22:13 < Assa> character.cpp #L532 GetProximityRadius()/3.f
22:13 < Assa> for 'perfect' deathtiles it should be GetProximityRadius()/2.f
22:14 < Oy> ah you mean the distance to kill you
22:14 < Assa> exactly
22:15 < Assa> ofc all tiles have the same size in editor, since teeworlds uses a grid
22:17 < Oy> well, then the distance to kill you in your test case should be like the current one ;)
22:18 <@Dune> 67e2f3f is obscenely simple-looking
22:19 < Assa> It is just the regular size * 2/3 ^.^
22:26 < Assa> @Oy @Dune I did a new pull request and closed the other one, because I begin from clean source and used the MoveBox now. The code is now much shorter and better ^.^
22:27 <@Dune> better squeeze the commit and push -f so you don't lose the comment history
22:27 <@Dune> but yeah it looks better :2
22:27 <@Dune> :)
22:27 <@heinrich5991> Dune: do you know what the webhook on the discord server is? you created it. do you still use it?
22:27 <@Dune> huh
22:27 <@Dune> well it's for the github bot on discord, so yeah we still use that?
22:28 <@heinrich5991> okay :)
22:28 <@Dune> issues are enabled on the IRC bot but PRs aren't btw
22:28 < Assa> you have a discord?
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> see here
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜›
22:29 <@Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12576
22:29 < Assa> Github is really missing a chat service
22:29 <@Dune> It had a chat service until January
22:30 < Assa> The "see here" link doesn't work for me :o
22:30 <@Dune> it's not a link
22:36 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 commit to branch master: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/compare/8abd41a65791...912442347daa
22:36 < Teeworlds>  â€¢ oy (d8ce682): corrected some possible parameter misuse (int -> float)
22:37 < Assa> I accidently added changes to system.c and system.h to my pull request ... how do i get rid of it?
22:37 <@Dune> "81 additions and 81 deletions" ouch :D
22:37 <@Dune> Assa, git reset system.*
22:38 <@heinrich5991> nice, Teeworlds didn't get forwarded this time :)
22:39 <@Dune> yeah :)
22:39 <@Dune> good job
22:40 < Assa> next time i will do a better job at keeping things konsistent ...
22:43 <@Dune> don't sweat it Assa, my first PR didn't even ever compile :D
22:45 < Assa> Now i added a changed version.h to make it even worse :)
22:46 <@heinrich5991> Assa: do you know git cherry-pick? you can create a branch with only the things you want in it
22:47 <@heinrich5991> git checkout -b deathtileskip3 upstream/master (or however your upstream remote is called)
22:48 <@heinrich5991> git cherry-pick <commit> <commit> <commit>
22:48 <@heinrich5991> git push origin +deathtileskip3:deathtileskip2 (to override the current commit)
22:53 < Assa> my upstream is called origin, and my origin is called upstream to make it more complicated
22:53 <@Dune> call it "teeworlds" and "assa" :)
22:54 < Assa> normally i do it right, but apperently not this time
22:54 <@Dune> you can git remote add/delete to rename remotes
22:55 <@heinrich5991> also git remote rename
22:55 <@Dune> oh that's a thing?
23:02 <@heinrich5991> yup
23:05 < Assa> i should definatly do that
23:08 < Assa> git push -f needed but this should do now
23:08 <@heinrich5991> don't do -f
23:08 <@heinrich5991> add a + in front of the branch you want to override
23:10 < Assa> why don't do -f?
23:11 <@Dune> it changes anything for github?
23:11 <@heinrich5991> because using -f creates bad habits :) + makes it clear which of the branches you're currently pushing needs to be overrideen
23:11 <@heinrich5991> *overridden
23:12 <@Dune> but in the end, for github, it's the same, right?
23:12 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:12 <@heinrich5991> (just for the user)
23:13 < Assa> git remote rename <-- nice
23:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> uff is any one working on the high dpi support? I thought only macOS is making trouble but also windows10 is very annoying. The textures are not crisp and all the open winsows get meesed up and resized.
23:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> in this state 0.7 is unsuable .-. i sadly have no idea how to fix it
23:15 < Assa> can you explain the problem in more detail to me? I just finished my pull request :)
23:16 <@Dune> @ChillerDragon: we wanted it done for 0.7.3 but found no one to test stuff or work on it
23:16 <@Dune> linux doesn't have the problem so...
23:19 < Assa> oh its mac specific, iam out :o
23:20 <@Dune> windows too but you need to have highdpi on your system to test
23:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wait so nobody could reproduce the windows issue?
23:26 <@Dune> I don't have highdpi, oy doesn't either
23:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> On linux it works kinda fine for me as well. I mean linux has other bugs no matter if high dpi or not
23:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh
23:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I feelt kinda early like 4 years ago with my 4k screen but i thou8ght nowerdays its pretty common.
23:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Im here if you need somebody to repdroduce/test high dpi issues on windows macOs or linux but idk how to fix them.
23:28 <@Dune> meh you need a lot of other expensive things if you want to use its potential anyway and it's poorly handled by plenty of applications
23:28 <@Dune> I only have 4k where I had no options
23:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i only use discord a browser and tw
23:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and ddnet supproted it pretty well since years already
23:28 <@Dune> then PR the patch
23:28 < minus> ah, more reflection
23:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> idk what the patch is ._.
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im not even sure who worked on that
23:29 < Assa> PR this issue, so sombody does fix the problem
23:29 <@Dune> huh?
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ?
23:29 < minus> somehow master3 is using 10G of RAM
23:29 <@Dune> there is already an issue
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> one for macOS ye
23:29 <@Dune> welp is that different than last time, minus ?
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but i guess it would be usless to creater one for windows as well
23:30 <@Dune> yes
23:30 < minus> yes, it was just 100% CPU before
23:30 < minus> which it is again
23:30 <@Dune> huh, so something changed
23:30 < minus> mr anderson must've not created the firewall rules right
23:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm
23:30 <@Dune> for hidpi there is https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1773 but we didn't get feedback
23:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i thought his frewall skills are 10/10
23:31 <@Dune> should I ping him minus?
23:31 < minus> i killed the server for now but it should be fixed properly
23:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Mr_Anderson
23:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh so you need feedback on that? Meh it has conflicsts
23:32 <@Dune> it's an old PR, those always have some
23:32 <@Dune> someone's gotta do the work if you want it fixed
23:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I have been testing it a bit and gave feedback on this bridge i guess but it never solved my macOS issues
23:32 <@Dune> the conflicts is probably because a bunch of spaces got removed everywhere by the editor
23:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i cant even see what the conflicts are do i need write access to see them?
23:33 <@Dune> you need to pull and to rebase master (or merge master) to resolve them
23:33 <@Dune> git checkout -b LordSk-feature/highdpi master
23:33 <@Dune> git pull https://github.com/LordSk/teeworlds.git feature/highdpi
23:34 < Assa> good luck :)
23:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so this pr is waiting for some1 to tets it and give greenlight?
23:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Then i will test it tomorrow probably
23:34 <@Dune> something like that yeah, need to ask Oy
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @LordSk just to let you know. Always feel free to ping me when you need somebody to test anything ðŸ˜ƒ
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> does tw only use 1 thread for cpu?
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the tw server only uses one thread, the client uses another one for graphics handling
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (and sound loading during startup)
23:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Is there an issue or plan somewhere to use more threads
23:44 < Assa> I think it doesn't really make sense
23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im still not sure about the whole multi core threading world i think i didnt get it. If i pay way more money to get lowr clock speed but more cores tw will loose fps because it doesnt spawn enought threads right?
23:45 < Assa> In case we get bot support, teeworlds should use another core for bot calculations, since they need a lot of cpu power
23:46 <@heinrich5991> test
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> spam!
23:47 <@heinrich5991> test2
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> does any1 know how hardare works and can proof my theory that more expensive cpus have worse tw performance
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> tw isn't cpu-bound
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what ever that means xd
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> it means its gpu bound
23:48 < Assa> my client isn't cpu bound
23:48 < Assa> *gpu
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it means that the client wouldn't benefit from faster cpu speeds
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so gpu is the bottleneck not cpu?
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> neither is. the "wait for next tick" is the "bottleneck"
23:48 < Assa> i think the bottleneck is the update rate
23:49 < Assa> ^this
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> good to know
23:49 < Assa> Teeworlds only has 50Hz updates
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> well for server is 50 ticks per seconds ye
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so i can buy hardare with low clock speed but more cores without lossing tw performance
23:49 < Assa> Feel free to set this to 128 for your server. This may make sense if you host a race server
23:49 <@heinrich5991> that won't fly with the client
23:50 < Assa> do they have to be in sync?
23:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> ye I dont think you can just change the tick speed with no problem
23:50 <@Dune> ooh, the bridge is grouping messages per user now, neat, heinrich5991 
23:51 <@heinrich5991> :) just found this option in the bridge config
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lookse more discordish now
23:51 < Assa> I can change the update rate fairly easily, i wonder if the client would work
23:51 <@heinrich5991> try it. probably not. also, the 50 for the update rate is hardcoded in some places as well
23:51 < Assa> hardcoded? lol
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but servers defnetly run into cpu bottlenecks on attacks
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> just run the attacks on another thread kappa
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i realized that one of my server cores was at 100% and others were idle but my tw server was taken down by ddos
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> even tho my vps had more power
23:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I feel like the solution to that isn't "buy more threads" but "fix the code"
23:53 <@heinrich5991> Assa: yes? that's bound to happen if you don't test other update rates
23:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> fix the code = use more threads?
23:53 < Assa> The Solution to DDos is "call your provider"
23:53 <@heinrich5991> DDoS is thrown around a bitl iberally here. there's also application level DoS for teeworlds servers
23:54 <@heinrich5991> I don't know if teeworlds got the patch of ddnet yet that you don't try to decompress packets from non-connected IPs
23:54 < minus> the solution to DDoS is to delete Teeworlds
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> f4
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> Btw where is the "wait for next tick" on the client? if any
23:55 < minus> add Alt to that and we're onthe right way
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lol minus
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> only thing close to it I know of is the thread_sleep(g_Config.m_ClCpuThrottle);
23:55 <@heinrich5991> Fudgy: that only happens if you have vsync on
23:55 <@heinrich5991> then it's `SwapBuffers()` or so
23:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> ah that too ok
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> related to my prev question : if I want to load, lets say demos, in the background, its fine if I do it bit by bit somewhere instead of using threads?
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I need to do it for something I'm working on
23:57 < minus> in general, threads are the problem, not the solution
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> haha probably
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I couldnt debug them anyway
23:59 <@heinrich5991> as long as you use message passing for synchronization, they're fine
