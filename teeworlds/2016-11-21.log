06:38 < ***> Buffer Playback...
06:38 < needs1> [06:36:22] Sorry, It does again, probably a failure on my side
06:38 < ***> Playback Complete.
22:08 <@heinrich5991> minus: teeworlds.com seems downish
22:09 <+EastByte> does cloudflare respond?
22:10 <+EastByte> tw.com just seems slow
22:10 <+Henningstone> you can still ping it quite fine and still access https://www.teeworlds.com/master-bans.cfg for example
22:11 <@heinrich5991> Website is offline
22:11 <@heinrich5991> (Cloudflare Error)
22:12 <@minus> loads for me
22:12 <@minus> although slowly
22:12 <+EastByte> is the webserver heavy loaded?
22:13 <@heinrich5991> minus: try https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/index.php
22:13 <@minus> probably DDoS in the DC
22:13 <@heinrich5991> DC?
22:13 <+EastByte> datacenter
22:13 <@heinrich5991> ah
22:14 <@minus> well, it's not our box that's under high load
22:14 <@heinrich5991> good
22:14 <+EastByte> I thought you put it somewhere "safe" :D
22:23 <+Stitch626> EastByte you know it.. you cannot be safe, nowhere.. maybe cyberbunker but thats too expensive
22:24 <+Stitch626> well, bad english :/
22:29 <+EastByte> As long as the location of the server isn't known, it already is extremely "safe". But if the actual location has such unusual network issues, it seems pretty bad :p
22:30 <+Kottizen> DDoS it is, indeed.
22:31 <@heinrich5991> Kottizen: against one of your servers?
22:32 <+Kottizen> Yes, against kottcraft.se.
22:33 <+EastByte> you are kind of implying that tw.com is hosted there
22:37 <+Kottizen> That's correct.
22:37 <@minus> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
22:37 <+EastByte> well, the whole point of cloudflare is useless then :p
22:38 <+Kottizen> If you say so.
