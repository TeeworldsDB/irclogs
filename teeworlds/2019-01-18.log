00:01 < Oy> better be on the safe side :)
00:04 < Oy> day: you could try to remove that line https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/client/input.cpp#L218 and the #endif 8 lines down - maybe that fixes the stuck mouse cursor
00:04 < Oy> that did it for me on mac at least
00:10 <@Dune> what did you have in mind for "Maybe showing a box with less alpha when they're not selected"

00:11 <@Dune> doesn't look great
00:14 < Oy> yeah, looks bit odd
00:14 <@Dune> btw bots shouldn't be counted in total players
00:15 < Oy> well. depends on the filter setting
00:15 <@Dune> aren't total players supposed to be filter independent
00:15 <@Dune> like the stat on the bottom
00:15 <@Dune> or you think it should default to with bots
00:16 < Oy> default is with bots yeah
00:18 < Oy> bottom value also count specs
00:18 <@Dune> right
00:19 < Oy> out now. gn8 :)
00:20 <@Dune> gn8 :)
04:27 < TeeSlayer> "Random | with ai" / 163.172.95.239:8306 is announcing bots as players. This is in violation of the rules as stated on the forum. So whoever is running them should probably change that.
04:28 < TeeSlayer> Ahhh, nvm..
04:30 < TeeSlayer> "Hide bots" fixes it^^
09:27 <@Dune> Should update forum rules
10:31 < rand> how dare you to accuse one of the first servers to use the bot flag in server info â€½ :p

13:29 < TeeSlayer> rand: it was late and I was confused because the client told me they were players :D
13:30 < TeeSlayer> I guess there is no easy solution for this
13:30 < rand> np ^^ the hide bots does the trick :)
13:58 <@Dune> Updated the server rules forum post: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10442
13:59 < rand> welcome back in the future
14:00 < rand> > The maximum player count must be the maximum number of human players.
14:00 < rand> hm, the serverbrowser does not work that way iirc now
14:01 < rand> bot players are counted in maximum players
14:01 <@Dune> correct
14:02 <@Dune> should I edit?
14:02 < rand> either the rules are now incorrect, or the implementation is wrong (or confusing for me)
14:02 <@Dune> hm, not sure how to make it clear
14:03 < rand> iirc, in 0.6, this "maximum player" is the same as "the max clients", am I wrong ?
14:04 <@Dune> yes
14:04 <@Dune> (it is)
14:05 < rand> a way to edit this is to add "plus the number of playing bots" but it makes the rule weird
14:06 < rand> I don't know how other games annouce bots
14:08 < rand> (finally, I feel like, the zomb mod does it right by not broadcasting the bots in the serverinfo, but the feature (bot flag) is there)
14:09 < rand> maybe the serverinfo should reduce maxclients by the number of bots
14:09 <@heinrich5991> no need to fix this in the server info, we can just calculate it in the client :)
14:10 <@heinrich5991> might actually be a good idea to display it as curhumanplayers(+botplayers)/maxhumanplayers
14:10 <@heinrich5991> or curhumanplayers/maxhumanplayers if there are no bots present
14:23 <@Dune> +1 heinrich5991
14:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hey rand, have you seen this https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1966 ?
14:31 < rand> I did
14:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Are you interested in implementing it?
14:41 < rand> if I find the time to do it, I'd rather do it differently than with my mod (which is experimental and a bit bloated)
14:42 < rand> I read a bit your code for this purpose
14:43 < rand> feel free to take the lead :)
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> my code?
14:46 < rand> hm, or sushi ? hm
14:46 < rand> on Zomb mod
14:46 <@Dune> zomb?
14:46 <@Dune> zombies are stupid per-design tho
14:47 < rand> I got my hand on a client bot which was pretty nice but I cant use the source without the dev (and I won't plane to ask) but the idea is simple, A* every where
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> oh yeah zomb is not a great example haha
14:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> but when we had the meeting we specifically talked about your bot mod rand
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> we were hoping you'd be interested in merging it into the game
14:50 < rand> k
14:50 < rand> I won't have objection after some cleaning
14:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> alright great then
14:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> we can discuss any arising design issues in the github issue post
14:59 < rand> (i would be glad in fact ^^)
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ðŸ˜„
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i would add human reaction time to the bots... so they are not uber op
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> like openAi did to their Dota Ai
17:08 < rand> I have to re-read that quake bot thesis
17:13 < TeeSlayer> the openai team should try to master ddrace
17:14 < TeeSlayer> that would be cool
17:18 <@Dune> o/
17:18 < Oy> \o
17:24 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr opened pull request #1988: RFC: Dynamic camera smooth toggle (master...feature-toggle-dyncam) https://git.io/fhR6h
17:26 < rand> wow
17:29  * Dune introduces more float timers
17:30 <@Dune> ah, nvm, I think LocalTime() is supposed to be a float
17:35 < rand> well, if LocalTime() is in second, you use a float timer with ToggleTime
17:37 < rand> for static to dynamic, is the blending useful ?  
17:37 <@Dune> good question
17:38 < rand> I except the mouse to be at the limit of the deadzoneâ€¦ oh, it is, if the distance are not the same
17:40 <@Dune> might want to remove that blend if maxdistancestatic â‰¤ maxdistancedynamic ?
17:40 < rand> i think I dont have the correct terminology but if the cursor for static is farther than the dynamic distance for mousefollow, then, it should blend 
17:41 < rand> maybe, cancel the blend if the cursor is in maxdistancedynamic (maybe it already does this)
17:41 <@Dune> if I understood you right, you meant exactly what I said
17:42 <@Dune> (or the opposite, I think I said it wrong)
17:42 <@Dune>  maxdistancestatic â‰¤ maxdistancedynamic  -> no blend
17:43 < rand> yes, but the pointer can at distance â‰¤ maxdistancedynamic whatever the maxdistancestatic is
17:44 < rand> then, when I move the mouse in the 125ms after the toggle, i don't want to have a smooth transition since I start from a valid view area
17:44 < rand> well, it's only 125ms
17:51 <@Dune> ah, right

19:12 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 6cb1eb4 oy: fixed description for inp_mousesens config
19:23 < Oy> Dune: we should probably mention that we use this https://oeis.org/A036569 gab sequence
19:32 < Oy> and could comment out the line #include "array.h"
19:32 <@Dune> ah, yes
19:32 <@Dune> silly me quoting a dynamic wikipedia page
19:32 < Oy> the shell sort looks good to me
19:32 < Oy> maybe someone else wants to check it too?
19:34 < Oy> Dune: i think you can keep the wiki link, just add the ones for the gab sequence too
19:35 < Oy> cause ours differ from the one mentioned in the pseudocode

19:54 <@Dune> should print weapons on top of 1 2 3 4 5
19:54 <@Dune> not sure if i'll keep the big space bar - doesn't make sense for other keys
20:02 < Oy> looks good
20:03 < Oy> how about doing weapons/icons on top of the button?
20:04 < Oy> u gonna do the mouse(fire/hook) too?
20:08 <@Dune> Yeah
20:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @1stDecadeTW ^
20:11 <@Dune> Mouse wheel is more noob friendly, would be nice if it could be shown 
20:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Awesome!
20:13 <@Dune> How should it be closed though? Esc ?
20:18 < Oy> esc probably best
20:20 < rand> should the bind <ready> be shown too ?
20:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> There are many that I left out, like Show chat, Console..
20:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Imo ready is for advanced, competitive players => no
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Maybe it should be a popup instead, and mention settings > controls
20:22 < Oy> maybe add a hint "you can change the controls and find additional ones in settings->controls"
20:22 < Oy> :D
20:23 < Oy> 2 idiots one thought :)
