00:01 < Marcel> do you want to go for http or https
00:01 < Marcel> i'd stick to https as it already has a handshake
00:04 <@heinrich5991> yes, https
00:04 <@heinrich5991> http has a handshake, too
00:04 <@heinrich5991> tcp, namely
00:06 < Marcel> oh yea right
00:09 < Marcel> soo who should write the master
00:10 <@heinrich5991> the master was 50 lines of code or so and is already written IIRC
00:10 <@heinrich5991> the things that are missing are: adding libcurl to teeworlds 0.6.5 (both with bam and cmake), and write the registering code
00:10 <@heinrich5991> and the backward compatibility for servers not supporting the http masters
00:13 < Marcel> did you add a version number
00:13 <@heinrich5991> where?
00:14 < Marcel> to the protocol
00:15 <@heinrich5991> I wanted to add one to the url, but it's not really necessary
00:15 <@heinrich5991> you could always add one later. the only benefit of adding it right now is that the urls will look more symmetrical to the old ones
00:15 < Marcel> yep

18:54 < Dune> hi
18:54 < rand> ho
19:27  * bridge [freenode] <Digit> misses teeworlds, or rather, teeworlds with other players, and wonders what tactics/methods/technologies are being used to combat the problem
19:35  * Dune wishes to fix this communication problem
19:45 < rand> join 0.7, bring feedback, (wish to) profit
19:53 < Dune> oy is not on this evening :/
20:02 < rand> we need a PR for serverbrowser ui
20:38 < Dune> yeah that's the last thing rand
20:39 < Dune> but we don't know exactly what it should be like
