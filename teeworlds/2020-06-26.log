12:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Teeworlds doesn't support IPv6 hostet servers, does it?
12:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I know I can join on them with locally <.<
12:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ~with~
12:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I could use a DynDns server, would it work, has anyone experience with it?
12:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The server has dual stack support but the master server only supports ipv4
12:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> When you connect via hostnane it might work. Depends on the parameter for the DNS lookup
12:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Guess I need to test it, I will provide feedback
12:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Feedback 1: my provider doesn't support every dyndns provider ... so I have to switch
12:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Does sv_port change the local port, too?
12:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i used `sv_port 5022`, but find the server under `192. ... :8303`
12:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I know that the config was read, because the server name changed accordingly
12:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I have never seen this behaviour before: The server is not giving me warnings nor is it sending heartbeats
12:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> It works: I can find my server under `_minecraft._tcp.yggdrasil42.ddnss.ch:5022`, BUT the masterserver doesn't list my server. So it's probably some masterserver firewall chenanigans
12:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> (I know this IP looks strange, I used the minecraft ports, because the free version of `ddnss` doesn't allow custom port forwarding and I used the minecraft preset)
13:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> The server still uses ipv6 wtf
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> how come i cant see some chat msgs
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> when logged in rcon
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> but i see them on rcon log
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> not in chat
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Teamchat or whispers I guess
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> whispers are not logged
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> They are
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> not in rcon
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Oh no sorry
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> normal msgs
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> they're logged in rcon
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> but nothing pops ingame
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> oh my bad
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> lol
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> had msgs from friends only
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜‰
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> forgot about that thing
