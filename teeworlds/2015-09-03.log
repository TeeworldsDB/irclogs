00:00 < tomreyn> also, do you use cppcheck?
00:06 <@matricks> I used to run the game thru valgrind
00:07 < tomreyn> is this how these recent security bugs were found?
00:18 < heinrich5991> tomreyn: they were usually found because people exploited them
00:18 < tomreyn> hmm, not ideal ;)
00:18 < tomreyn> try those tools then if you haven't
05:19 < nameless_tee06> I accidently deleted the settings file now nothing will save
05:19 < nameless_tee06> Hello?
05:22 < nameless_tee06> plz somebody
05:23 < nameless_tee06> nvm i fixed it
05:23 < nameless_tee06> u scumbags
09:02 < BotoX> well screw boost, this works better :p https://p.botox.bz/vihe.cpp
09:02 <@matricks> boost... hirr
09:03 <@matricks> what are you trying todo?
09:03 < BotoX> that's a working interactive reverse shell
09:03 < BotoX> socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:9001 on the server
09:04 < BotoX> and it's nearby as good as a real shell
09:04 < BotoX> still need to manually adjust the termsize with stty though
09:04 < BotoX> other than that everything works: htop, screen, vim, less, python interpreter, pipes, jobs
09:05 < BotoX> that code is running in a gameserver extension/plugin :v
09:06 < BotoX> are you watching Mr. Robot, matricks?
09:06 < BotoX> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/
09:06 <@matricks> I don't have time
09:07 < BotoX> ah, sadly
