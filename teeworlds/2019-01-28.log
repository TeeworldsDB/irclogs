09:44 <@Dune> This should at least be put in a "known issues" FAQ or something (that no dbus-launch causes issues)
10:43 <@Dune> Does anyone know what kind of compression mode I should use when running the convert script for teeworlds gfx? https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#compress
17:40 < TeeSlayer> so does anybody know if it's possible to change the colors ingame without destroying the character?
17:51 < rand> src/game/client/gameclient.cpp:645 looks like a no
17:52 < TeeSlayer> :(
17:53 < rand> maybe you can send two consecutive packet, Sv_ClientDrop and Sv_ClientInfo
17:54 < rand> without destroying the character on server side
17:54 < TeeSlayer> I basically need this for zCatch, and maybe Catch16 later
17:54 < TeeSlayer> I'll look into that, thanks
17:54 <@Dune>  you can change other characters but not the local character afaik
17:54 < rand> erf
17:54 <@Dune> can't you build the mod in a way that doesn't rely so heavily on colors?
17:55 < TeeSlayer> catch16 is pretty much impossible without color change, and it's nice to have for zcatch
17:56 <@Dune> is the color change needed for the local character? zomb changes other characters when they become low on life
17:56 < TeeSlayer> what do you mean by local char?
17:56 <@Dune> the character the player is playing?
17:57 < TeeSlayer> yes, no bots
17:57 < TeeSlayer> it's server-side only
17:57 <@Dune> I'm not talking about bots
17:57 < rand> the client don't care about the server info about himself
17:57 <@Dune> ^
17:58 < TeeSlayer> hm, true.. now I remember the color change on ZOMB, too
17:58 <@Dune> but you can destroy and remake other characters as you like
17:58 < TeeSlayer> I'll look into the code
17:58 <@Dune> do you understand?
17:59 < TeeSlayer> I think^^
17:59 < rand> is zcatch the mod where you start from blue and changing color for every kill you accumulate until you die ?
17:59 < TeeSlayer> yes
17:59 < TeeSlayer> I'm hosting two instances with laser and grenade on 0.7 right now
18:00 < rand> ok, then, sith the current client, you have too figure out a different way to know how many kills you got :c
18:00 <@Dune> Slayer did it with the armor count iirc
18:00 < rand> but, you can use the color scheme for other tees
18:00 < TeeSlayer> armor count was just for anticamper
18:02 < TeeSlayer> but I do count the kills/deaths separately
18:10 < TeeSlayer> Dune: I use deadspeccam now, too
18:13 < rand> btw, when I leave speccam to freecam, every tees (also pickups?) disappear for a second, can anyone reproduce it ?
19:03 < TeeSlayer> I might have encountered it I think, but can't reproduce it rn
19:03 < TeeSlayer> is K/D calculated by the client?
20:35 <@heinrich5991> TeeSlayer: yes it is
20:37 <@heinrich5991> rand: probably related to the "max camera movement speed while in spec" thing
21:05 < TeeSlayer> heinrich5991: huh, so it shouldn't be possible that somebody joins the game with a K/D?
21:05 <@heinrich5991> no
21:05 < TeeSlayer> or is it being saved if somebody rejoins?
21:06 < TeeSlayer> because that occured on one of my servers
21:06 <@heinrich5991> unless there's a bug where it's not reset
21:06 < TeeSlayer> on the server-side?
21:08 <@heinrich5991> on the client-side
21:08 <@heinrich5991> the entire K/D calculation happens client-side as far as I know
21:09 <@heinrich5991> (this is going to get fixed, there's an issue about this)
21:10 < TeeSlayer> okay
21:10 < TeeSlayer> thanks for the info
21:12 < TeeSlayer> heinrich5991: deadspecmode works quite nice btw
21:12 <@heinrich5991> great :)
21:12 < TeeSlayer> I like it a lot more than how it used to be on 0.6
21:12 <@heinrich5991> well, it's kinda designed for it ^^
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <NoTeefy> Would be nice to have a way to override client K/Ds with the one calculated on the server since you can never trust clients ðŸ˜ƒ
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <NoTeefy> Would be nice to have a way to override client K/Ds with the one calculated on the server since you can never trust clients
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> huh, I don't think the client sends the K/D to the server
23:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <NoTeefy> My bad then. I missunderstood TeeSlayers question about the clients having K/D stats when joining the server
23:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <NoTeefy> all good then
