14:58 < imanoob> hi guys i have a little help about vs , how can open teeworlds source in vs2017 ?
16:53 <@heinrich5991> imanoob: there's no easy way to open it as a project. you can open the source files
22:23 < imanoob> @heinrich5991 tnx , so i couldnt compile teeworlds vanilla source with vs ! the only way is https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=9541 ?
22:23 <@heinrich5991> yes
22:23 <@heinrich5991> it's using VS's compiler though
22:26 < imanoob> hmm, ok . i think "CodeBlocks" is better choice for me; np thank you anyway.
22:30 <@minus> bam is kinda lacking there; unlike CMake it doesn't generate VS/XCode projects
22:31 <@minus> looks like matricks went missing here a week ago :o
