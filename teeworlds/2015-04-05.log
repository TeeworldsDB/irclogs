10:16 < holymadtee> a mate can't find any servers on win 8.1, at this point i'm clueless. does anyone have an idea ?
10:27 < Edible> oh wow
10:27 < Edible> he got it running
10:28 < Edible> thats something
10:28 < Edible> farther than i got
10:28 < Edible> tell him to run virtualbox with linux and run teeworlds there
12:42 < BotoX> lol what
12:42 < BotoX> Why would teeworlds not run on 8.1
12:42 <@matricks> because microsoft
12:42 < BotoX> It runs fine for everyone that I know
12:43 < BotoX> And it even runs for me in a 8.1 VM
12:50 < Teetime> does somebody knows what the hell is going on here? http://ideone.com/qw96E3
12:52 <@matricks> Teetime: lol
12:52 <@matricks> Teetime: what me to rewrite it for you?
12:53 < Teetime> well if you want... i dont really understand the condition
12:53 < Teetime> i've never seen something like ":>>>= a <: !!.1"
12:54 <@matricks> :> == ]
12:54 <@matricks> <: == [
12:54 <@matricks> they are digraphs
12:55 <@matricks> so it reads more like "] >>= a[!!.1]"
12:55 < Teetime> ohhh
12:56 <@matricks> .1 == 0.1
12:56 <@matricks> !0.1 == 0
12:56 <@matricks> !!0.1 == 1
12:58 <@matricks> while( a[0] >>= a[1] )
12:59 < Teetime> I think i got it, thanks :)
