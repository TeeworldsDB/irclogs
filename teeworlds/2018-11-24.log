11:00 <@Dune> ahoi
11:01 < Oy> hey
11:01 <@Dune> locked translations. not sure which to add
11:01 <@Dune> it seems like the major ones all had contributions
11:02 <@Dune> can't believe french had so little
11:03 < Oy> add everything we have?
11:03 <@Dune> don't I scrap away the 0.6-only ones?
11:04 < Oy> hm, dunno how many strings from 0.6 are still valid
11:04 <@Dune> 89%
11:05 < Oy> then we could still use the not updated ones
11:05 <@Dune> alright
11:06 <@Dune> the server browser is mostly english
11:07 <@Dune> is there anything to setup/fix for the version server?
11:08 < Oy> the server should work
11:09 < Oy> dunno if the urls still still resolves to an address
11:11 < Oy> oh, to inform 0.6 clients the one from the 0.6 have to used and updated so it broadcasts the correct version
11:11 < Oy> 0.6 clients can't interact with the 0.7 one
11:11 <@Dune> the 0.6 is the one that matters
11:12 <@Dune> know how to update it?
11:13 <@Dune> I can't resolve version.teeworlds.com :(
11:15 < Oy> minus: ping
11:15 < minus> Oy: pong
11:16 < Oy> minus: version.teeworlds.com doesn't resolve to an address
11:16 < Oy> do you have access to fix that?
11:17 < minus> yes
11:17 <@Dune> nice
11:19 < Oy> good
11:23 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to 0.6: https://git.io/fp089
11:23 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/0.6 7d8234e oy: Made the 0.6 version server broadcast 0.7.1 as new version
11:26 < minus> Oy: an 8 byte array? with just 5 (or 6 including terminator) characters?
11:28 < Oy> minus: the original array is 8 bytes as well, not sure if the client checks for corrects siye and dropps too short ones
11:28 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/0.6/src/game/version.h#L8
11:29 < rand> is there a scrollbar in the serverbrower to see the client list on a server ?
11:31 < Oy> no
11:32 < minus> Oy: aye, but it should be sizeof(GAME_RELEASE_VERSION) then instead of 8
11:43 < Oy> minus: that's the same ;) but yeah, that code won't be used/modified in the future so i guess it's fine :)
11:46 < rand> crap
11:49 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Sonix- opened pull request #1712: Add theme icons (master...icons) https://git.io/fp04i
11:57 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed pull request #1712: Add theme icons (master...icons) https://git.io/fp04i
11:58 < Oy> attaching the slight background to the top tabs. how should be in the server browser?
11:58 < Oy> http://www.solidfiles.com/v/pW8YWMYx7K6z5 just for the list?
11:59 < Oy> or completely? or both?
11:59 <@Dune> I have to make it that none.png is taken into account
11:59 <@Dune> thanks for the icons @sonix
11:59 < Sonix-> that looks odd Oy 
12:00 < Oy> yeah kinda
12:02 < Oy> http://www.solidfiles.com/v/AnwGB7QzB34R8
12:03 < Oy> http://www.solidfiles.com/v/e8RQ6wNmQBYPN
12:05 <@Dune> is it me or the heavens bgmap sometimes has a super fast cloud speeding behind :D
12:05 < Oy> yeah
12:05 <@Dune> Sonix-: gotta fix that I guess
12:05 < Oy> seems the reset for the animation
12:05 <@Dune> isn't it a map problem?
12:06 < Oy> some envelope setting?
12:06 < Oy> don'T map that much :D
12:06 <@Dune> me neither :c
12:07 < Oy> but it's just one i think, so probably an envelope setting thing
12:07 <@Dune> well it's funny :D
12:09 < Sonix-> this is what i suggest for ingame menus if there are sub menus or buttons
12:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> 
12:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/515846517676965899/tabs_menu.png
12:12 < Sonix-> oh lol i'll fix the cloud later :D
12:15 < Oy> Sonix-: should be a general thing
12:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> where else do we have 2 rows of buttons
12:16 <@Dune> working on a new blood theme I see Sonix- :D
12:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Actually I was thinking about a jungle and spiky theme Dune :p
12:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> from a banner i've made some time ago
12:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/515848666003537929/path941_4.png
12:19 <@Dune> ooh, cool :)
12:21 < Oy> i meant the tab Sonix- i meant that the top row looks like tabs
12:22 < Sonix-> the top row are esc menu buttons/options
12:23 < Sonix-> you click settings f.e. and more options/tabs appear then is better to differentiate them from the main menu
12:23 < Sonix-> and make them actually look tabs with actual content
12:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> 
12:24 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/515850213861228557/test_igmenu.png
12:25 < Sonix-> something like this for only buttons? f.e moving up in there the join red and blue buttons
12:26 < Sonix-> as u can see the other main row button are separated from the content
12:27 < Sonix-> indicating that they're not connected
12:28 < Oy> kinda difficult with the gradient
12:29 < Sonix-> what gradient?
12:29 < Sonix-> the one in the main row remains untouched
12:30 < Sonix-> the other one you guys added just looks ugly and out of place
12:30 < Oy> which one?
12:31 < Sonix-> the one in the 2nd row if you're talking about that one https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/355114/48788371-fadba080-ecea-11e8-9c33-20fa8c19081d.png
12:31 < Sonix-> https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/293850/48898849-288d2a80-ee4e-11e8-9bed-f6aa56805589.png
12:32 < Sonix-> the gradient is and should be used only for the very top and bottom button rows
12:32 <@Dune> yeah it's weird rn
12:33 < Oy> posted a pic yesterday with a solid background for that row
12:37 <@Dune> should I poll people on default map theme? idk what the overall feeling is like
12:39 < Oy> when there isn't a gradient the buttons seem to dark compared to the ones on the bottom, cause the ones on the bottom have a gradient http://www.solidfiles.com/v/AnwGAVnRjwvQB
12:47 < Oy> or removed http://www.solidfiles.com/v/vDpnnmNgNj3KN
12:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> removed is better
12:53 < Oy> ok
12:54 < Oy> tab colour should probably be changed
12:54 < Oy> hard to seperate deactivated ones from not active ones
12:55 < Oy> maybe better to remove the deactivated ones again?
12:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah no point keeeping them there
13:06 <@Dune> I think the second row of tabs should have only top round corners
13:06 <@Dune> it looks a bit strange like that
13:07 < Oy> http://www.solidfiles.com/v/3PMknwAYBQPxW
13:08 < Oy> corners just have to be on top yeah and the not active tabs need brighter text colour
13:08 < Oy> besides that?
13:09 <@Dune> then it's just the join/disconnect buttons accessibility
13:09 <@Dune> and remove the back button, it makes no sense anymore
13:16 < Oy> dunno what to do with that reset button :(
13:19 <@Dune> hmmm
13:20 <@Dune> I only have silly ideas :/
13:32 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr opened pull request #1713: Scan for the none.png icon for the checkerboard theme (master...feature-theme-none) https://git.io/fp00l
13:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @oy @Dune why not remove the reset and back button and add the button row from the normal ingame menu?
13:43 <@Dune> that's what we're trying to do @fisico
13:44 <@Dune> but where do you put the reset button?
13:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> what does the reset button do?
13:44 <@Dune> reset settings
13:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> remove it ðŸ˜„
13:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> no need to put in in the ingame settings menu ðŸ˜„
13:48 <@Dune> :/
13:59 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed pull request #1713: Scan for the none.png icon for the checkerboard theme (master...feature-theme-none) https://git.io/fp00l
13:59 < Oy> yeah removing the reset button is kind bad...
14:05 < Oy> so https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1611 should be fixed now http://www.solidfiles.com/v/xK3DAN86Lakx4
14:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @oy yea like i now ðŸ˜„ good work
14:17 <@Dune> yeah :)
15:10 <@Dune> any idea what could cause https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1714 ?
15:16 < Oy> maybe too much data because of the chat spam so the client gets flooded?
15:17 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/fp0zC
15:17 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master e2684bc oy: improved the ingame menus. closes #1611
15:17 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 42707f9 oy: Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
15:24 <@Dune> yeah but that's a recent problem Oy
15:25 <@Dune> we used to not have this problem at all and now it's regular
15:27 < Oy> maybe it was just luck that it didnt happen
15:27 <@Dune> I really doubt that :/ now it happens within a minute
15:30 < rand> aren't the spectators listed in serverbrowser ?
15:30 < Oy> they are
15:30 < Oy> but there's a filter for it
15:30 < Oy> show players only
15:45 < Oy> Dune: didn't happen before? for the same config/spamchat value?
15:45 <@Dune> yeah
15:45 <@Dune> have to ask @LordSk but I doubt the server was changed
15:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Oy: I'd love for someone else to test it
16:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> so we can rule out the possibility of it happening only on my PC
16:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> but as I said on the issue it happened without bots as well
16:01 <@Dune> sorry I'm late on that task
16:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> when  I was chatting in game with Dune yesterday
16:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> he saw me disconnect on my own server first
16:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> then disconnected too
16:02 <@Dune> yep
16:02 <@Dune> I still could move somewhat
16:02 <@Dune> it got laggy
16:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @LordSk I put a server up
16:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> usual rcon, you can try to trigger it
16:11 < Oy> yeah, it's an issue tried this https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/a47f9faaf0480dbbaee24ad32caa7c49c44e3d38 there it doesn't happen
16:12 < Oy> now what commit triggers it :D
16:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it's recent that's for sure
16:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> have you tried a binary search?
16:39 <@Dune> no, we're "not hot on network stuff", like LordSk said :D
16:44 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fp0aI
16:44 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 07f009b oy: fixed faulty shift. closes #1714
16:44 <@Dune> oh, nice
16:44 < Oy> c&p error ...
16:45 < Oy> but good that you found that error Lordsk :)
16:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> that was fast
16:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah it wasn't on my end only apparently haha
16:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and since we don't have much people testing the latest version at the same time
16:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it would have been hard to uncover
16:50 < Oy> yeah, would come up for everyone after a while, but because of the huge amount of packtes send with the spam thing you got there faster :)
16:50 <@Dune> yeah, would have been nasty
17:10 < Oy> what about the other ingame menus server info, call vote etc. higher alpha there as well?
17:10 <@Dune> I don't know how to make that consistent
17:11 <@Dune> need to pull and try
17:11 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed pull request #1711: Display user IDs (master...feature/display_user_id) https://git.io/fpRji
17:11 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 7 new commits to master: https://git.io/fp0aH
17:11 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 72a6417 LordSk: Replace hard coded id display most everywhere
17:11 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master b285a3d LordSk: Stylize it a bit
17:11 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master c19c600 LordSk: Append rect width
17:13 < Oy> http://www.solidfiles.com/v/RKj78Zw7R8zpA higher alpha for the bigger darker background
17:14 < Oy> could increase just for the brighter fields instead
17:15 <@Dune> looks a bit high contrast there
17:15 <@Dune> I don't know, maybe it's just the change :)
17:16 < Oy> http://www.solidfiles.com/v/3PMkAZRXdWy4V
17:18 <@Dune> huh, increasing the alpha just makes it more white on white
17:18 <@Dune> right
17:18 <@Dune> maybe you could make those boxes black + 0.25 alpha
17:18 <@Dune> would be consistent with the settings menus
17:19 < Oy> yeah all of them need a rework, don't fit the style and coloursheme of the other menus
17:19 <@Dune> just make them black I guess
17:19 <@Dune> what else to be changed for consistence?
17:25 < Oy> the other menus have an offset to the tabs on top
17:25 <@Dune> ah
17:25 < Oy> dunno if it should be there too
17:25 <@Dune> I see, good catch
17:26 < Oy> http://www.solidfiles.com/v/r6GW47XjqGkqZ same as in the server browser
17:27 <@Dune> looks good imo but did you cut hte bottom of the scren or is it like that?
17:30 < Oy> they go till the bottom - needs to change as well
17:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> like the latest version oy
17:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i think the text(content) from the server info/game info should not be bigger than the fontsize in the buttons...
17:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> such a wall of text.. hit's you right in the face ðŸ˜„
17:53 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fp0w8
17:53 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master e865d1c oy: increased the overall cuteness factor of the ingame menus. closes #1551
17:53 < Oy> was always that way ;)
17:53 < Oy> dunno if it should be decreased much
17:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yea i think it should be
17:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> looks strange so many different font sizes
18:02 <@Dune> adjusted m_CutenessFactor eh
18:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ðŸ˜„
18:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> 
18:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/515937748121813013/font_sizes.png
18:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> every tab has another font size and padding settings... looks so unpolished
18:13 <@Dune> Call vote needs higher alpha
18:42 < Oy> maybe the boxes need some header like the pages in settings - then the fontsize could be the same as in the other menus
18:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> 
18:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/515948728561958932/unknown.png
18:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> would something like this be acceptable for the broadcast issue Oy?
19:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> What about chat
19:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hidden when typing for now
19:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> the broadcast itself minimizes after a few seconds
19:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> like that
19:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/515951609218596867/unknown.png
19:11 < Oy> could be
19:12 < Oy> broadcast should disappear completely after few seconds - like before
19:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> oh yeah it does as well
19:13 <@Dune> I like the shadow effect
19:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> like the new "broadcast"
19:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @oy great idea to seperate the headline from the text container ðŸ˜„
19:41 < Oy> bear mentioned that chat is harder to read on ctf2 - we should improve it someday :)
19:41 <@Dune> oh, bear is around? :o
19:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @LordSk btw broadcast used to last 10s
19:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok
19:43 < Oy> was on fisico's test server
19:48 < Oy> that reminds me: didn't he work on maps as well? should add cinaera then
19:52 <@Dune> oy: bear said nope
20:01 < Oy> ok
20:04 < Oy> btw. maybe we should use some donation money to add a private repo on github where the svg's of the graphics can be stored. better access and overview than dropbox folders
20:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <LordSk> why should graphics be private?
20:04 <@Dune> makes me wonder why private svgs should even be a thing :/
20:04 <@Dune> ha, lordsk beats me at it
20:05 <@Dune> but I agree the current dropbox stuff is clunky
20:11 < Oy> i sympathise with the graphic artist, that they don't want to make it public
20:11 < Oy> yeah the dropbox stuff isn't good
20:13 < minus> i don't
20:13 < minus> put graphics in the open
20:13 <@Dune> devs don't really have a choice tho, we have to make our code editable for all
20:13 < minus> oh, you can do the same for code; provide binaries only
20:14 <@Dune> not if you want to contribute to teeworlds minus
20:14 <@Dune> you can contribute graphically with a small file
20:14 < minus> okay yeah
20:15 <@Dune> it's a bit of a luxury the graphics guys have that people can't corrupt their ideas too much I guess
20:25 < Oy> well, they spend like 100 hours on a tileset and don't want to it get spread around then. or someone else steel the thunder
20:25 < Oy> i appreciate that they spend the time/work, so i'm ok with having the svg's not public
20:30 <@Dune> alright I see
20:52 <@Dune> what remains for the scoreboard, Oy?
20:58 < Oy> Dune: the reade indicator Sonix mentioned would be good
20:59 < Oy> and resolving the merge conflicts :P
21:02 <@Dune> no idea what it should be like though, I'm not even sure what this ready indicator does :|
21:15 < Oy> when you pause the game during a match everyone has to be ready again to continue the game
21:16 <@Dune> oh, alright
21:16 < Oy> used in clan matches, when someone gets network problems etc.
21:16 <@Dune> any suggestion? a color?
21:16 < Oy> green and red?
21:16 < Oy> maybe a dot? or the name? dunno?
21:17 < Oy> Sonix suggestions?
21:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix
21:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> green and red dots should be enough imo
21:34 < Dune_linux> so even without the time to completely implement the graphical side of my proposal for damage indicators, this could be done:
21:34 < Dune_linux> https://i.imgur.com/RX6ob6d.png
21:35 < Dune_linux> (the red-er star indicates health damage)
22:01 < Oy> you should open an issue ;)
22:04 <@Dune> right
22:04 <@Dune> that needs discussion :x
22:58 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> Hmm
22:58 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> So what's going on with teeworlds?
22:58 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> The 0.7.0 master servers are down right now?
22:58 <@Dune> no, they are updated
22:58 <@Dune> compatibility was broken
22:58 <@Dune> well 0.7.0 is down I guess, yeah
22:59 <@Dune> release is soon anyway
22:59 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> Releasing 0.6.5 and 0.7.0 at the same time was a bad idea imo
22:59 <@Dune> read https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=journal for the reasons
22:59 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> lots of confusion, people simultaneously using 3 incompatible versions
23:00 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> The official 0.6.5 download on the teeworlds website is incompatible with itself
23:00 <@Dune> huh, is it?
23:00 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> If you run teeworlds_srv from the 0.6.5 download, and then try to connect to it with a client using teeworlds, it says there's a version mismatch
23:00 <@Dune> ah
23:00 <@Dune> yeah there was a bug in the netcode, some patch had to be reverted
23:01 <@Dune> :/
23:01 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> Don't you think that release should be updated?
23:01 <@Dune> the 0.6 trunk works for the server
23:01 <@Dune> but yeah that's a good point
23:01 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> it's kinda crazy that the official download on the website for 0.6.5 would be incompatible with itself
23:02 <@Dune> there was quite little manpower at release time, even though we were given one week
23:02 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> well is there any way I can help?
23:02 <@Dune> sure, we're working on 0.7.1 right now
23:02 <@Dune> what are your skills?
23:02 <@Dune> coding?
23:03 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> project manager at a tech startup that works on open source software
23:03 <@Dune> that's cool :)
23:03 <@Dune> well that's the milestone: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/milestone/8
23:03 <@Dune> but most issues are already being worked on
23:06 < bridge_> [freenode] <rachelfish> Are there any plans to make the teeworlds server interactive? instead of relying on rcon? Like when I run ./teeworlds_srv it'd be nice if I could change config options / run commands directly from that terminal window
23:07 <@Dune> no plans for that afaik
23:07 <@Dune> you can open an issue on github for that
