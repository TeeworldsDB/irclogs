13:06 < lolo> Hi, it is allowed that bots are displayed in the Server list?
13:07 <@matricks> the number displayed in the server list should be the amount of human players
13:07 <@matricks> so people can find other people
13:10 < lolo> I have found a server, which does not adhere to this rule.
13:12 < lolo> An "IF City Server"
13:14 <@matricks> then it should be banned
13:15 <@minus> gonna banhammer it later
13:15 <@minus> just drop the ip/port
13:19 < lolo> IP: 5.196.4.216:8302 Check it out before you use the "banhammer" ;)
