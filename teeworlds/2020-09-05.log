09:03 < Dune> Has the srvbrowser scrollbar always been so sensitive? Scrolls an entire page onmousewheeldown
09:07 < Oy> hm, not sure, server browser was always special. but usually the scrollbar should scroll a third on mousewheel actions
09:09 < Oy> for me it scrolls about 70%
09:13 < Oy> opened an issue
09:16 < Dune> Seems like its related to the high amount of servers
09:57 < Oy> what about https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2658 ?
09:57 < Oy> it's "blue flag" in the capture msg's too
10:00 < Oy> use "free view"?
10:04 < Dune> Yeah
10:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> its "blue flag" because it is placed in a phrase isnt it
10:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> while on spec label its standalone, which is correct to use "Free view" or "Blue flag"
10:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> would be kinda odd everything lowercase imo
10:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> or maybe not dunno
10:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it comes after a :, common typo would be to lower case it
10:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> then yes
11:01 < Oy> yeah right. it's a proper noun in that case so we should capitalize it after the colon
11:26 < Dune> It is a proper noun?
11:29 < Oy> yeah, in that label
11:42 < Oy> Dune: does it still scroll a complete page for u?
11:47 < Dune> Gotta compile for win
11:48 < Oy> for me it works correct now
11:48 < Oy> what resolution do u use?
11:48 < Dune> Oy: this PR should be reverted. It worked fine on small server lists and now it's really slow
11:48 < Dune> 1920x1080
11:49 < Dune> On large lists it's better obviously but there's a problem here that the scroll # depends on the total size of the scroll list
11:50 < Dune> I don't think it's server browser related
11:50 < Dune> We just didn't notice because that's the only large scrollbar
11:50 < Dune> Except demos
11:54 < Oy> ah it's slow now for short lists :(
13:13 < Oy> how about a release this month?
13:13 < Oy> would fit the fall theme :)
13:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
13:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> End of the month? :D
13:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Still have a few things that I want to implement. The prediction PR has a few bugs, demo cutting and server side stats
13:19 < Oy> yeah, sounds good :)
13:19 < Oy> how is your improved text renderer?
13:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Never finished the last issues and it conflicts a bit with #2704. That PR is more important I think, as it adds new features. My code is just about improving rendering performance.
13:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I'll merge my code later but probably not this month. I'm also testing a MSDF based text renderer. Looks good so far but, but it requires (some basic) shaders, so it would require OpenGL 2.x instead of 1.x
13:39 < Dune> I don't know, we don't have much in the way of features, do we?
13:40 < Dune> The fall theme isn't ready imo
13:51 < Dune> had a look at the history since April, there's the gametype exclusion filter, the prediction, admittedly nice, but that's it
13:51 < Dune> a lot of fixes and minor improvements
13:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Are there any major features on the roadmap? Except for the new editor? Which seems a bit stuck at the moment =\
13:53 < Dune> well, there's no roadmap
13:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Any issues with features that would be cool and realizable without a compatibility break?
13:55 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afeature
13:55 < Dune> editor2 has 7 open issues
13:55 < Dune> pretty sure LordSk doesn't have spare time to write code atm
13:56 < Dune> but I agree we lack a roadmap/pinpointed large issues 
13:56 < Dune> there's the 0.7.6 milestone: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.7.6
13:57 < Dune> it includes a few interesting features to be fair
13:57 < Oy> there's still time till the end of the month :)
13:58 < Oy> #2704 is ice
13:58 < Oy> *nice
13:58 < Oy> the stuff redix is working on too
13:58 < Dune> #2704 is nice but I don't think many will notice :/
13:59 < Dune> if there's more good stuff by then, I'm all for it :)
13:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> A lot of Asian people will :D
13:59 < Oy> autumn theme could be done till then
13:59 < Dune> I don't think there are many asian people  around @redix redix_?
13:59 < Oy> yeah, seen lots of asian players today
13:59 < Dune> fall is much harder to do than the other ones, I'm not optimistic
14:00 < Dune> there's a reason  it was left unfixed :p
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> True, ddnet has a lot nowadays
14:00 < Dune> oh, I see, didn't know
14:01 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2380 that might be fixed by the uninitialized ip memory fix
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Nope already tested :(
14:01 < Dune> that's weird
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @Dune many new CJK players, CHN is now the biggest region playing on ddnet at some peaks
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> At least I could not reproduce it on my test setup
14:01 < Dune> I see, interesting
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The version server does not even reply tokens
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Where is Robyt3?
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/751775017968336926/unknown.png
14:05 < Oy> version server has to be rebuild
14:05 < Dune> not here
14:05 < Oy> with that fix
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> text is not centered in selected area
14:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Did someone check the firewall of the server it's running on? So far nobody could reproduce it and the same code is used  everywhere
14:06 < Dune> open an issue, @fokkonaut 
14:21 < Oy> heinrich5991 or minus: could you rebuild the version server with the latest source?
14:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://imgur.com/a/D35Whdq
14:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> all i can think for a fall theme using the actual gfx
14:22 < Oy> looks awesome :)
14:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> would be cool to have falling leaves or something tho, but i guess we will add them in the next versions
14:22 < Dune> Sonix: looks great!
14:22 < Dune> using jungle is a very good idea
14:22 < Oy> yeah falling leaves would be great
14:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i kinda dislike using jungle midground again
14:23 < Dune> midground?
14:23 < Dune> the solid tiles?
14:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> the bushes
14:23 < Dune> ah
14:23 < Dune> it really feels autumny though, good job
14:39 < Oy> anything else that should be added to the 0.7.6 milestone?
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> wont it break maps if add new gfx in 0.7.6
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> if we add*
15:13 < Oy> people should update their client :P
15:13 < Oy> but could just embed it to the theme map
15:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> True that
15:53 < Dune> adding new mapres that should not be used as external would be confusing
15:53 < Dune> but yeah, no need to
15:55 < Dune> Oy: about the milestone, I think https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2634 is a simple but important fix to have
16:37 < Oy> Dune: yeah, added it
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Dune if oy appears again, I started a versionsrv running on current master (2020-09-05, dccfaf9354af1dcfbdf60fc517f669346aa8b578) on version.teeworlds.com
23:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ok @heinrich5991
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> but still no response =\
23:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> i fixed scrollregion by making the m_ScrollY tie to content height instead of slider height.
