10:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> I am currently evaluating CLion, a C++ IDE from JetBrains, it's already so much better then Visual Studio and cross platform, it directly found teeworlds and configured CMake for me
11:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> 139 warnings in gamecontext.cpp xD
13:08 < bridge_> [freenode] <seabass[m]> nice :) I use Emacs for code editing, so I'm more used to running cmake manually. That said, I'm sure there'll be a cmake package in MELPA :D
13:08 < bridge_> [freenode] <seabass[m]> I use the JetBrains Mono font in Emacs though, so I might pass for a JetBrains user at first glance :D
14:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Learath2> CLion is pretty much the only acceptable IDE I've worked with
18:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> ```

18:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> 
18:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> I think the teeworlds master has already a merged pr somewhere for this? I am currently pulling just fixes for software update
18:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> this is a cmake warning^
18:20 < Dune> @Assa please don't, this is IRC
18:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> oops, what did I do wrong?
18:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> is the message to long?
18:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/b0c4c7002b28ee195934281e524f163f7ed30c59
18:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> should be the fix
18:20 < Dune> @assa don't do multiple lines (code blocks, etc)
18:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (and it's probably a gcc warning, not cmake's)
18:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> okay, I won't do it again, had a longer pause and may forgot some rules
18:21 < Dune> np
23:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> thank you @Dune btw
