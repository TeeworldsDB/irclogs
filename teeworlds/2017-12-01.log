02:38 < Transcix> the master server is not working, some ppl can't find any rooms via lobby/search.. it's been like this since at least yesterday.. i guess the teeworld admins know, and are working on it, right? or should i report it?
13:54 < Henningstone> Just out of interest, are there any statistics about the teeworlds forum activity? Like posts per day, online users per day, etc.?
14:53 <@matricks> not that i know of
14:56 < Henningstone> would of been interesting to see it go down over the last couple years, also at some point in 2017 there must have been a huge hit because suddenly the forum felt a lot more dead than before...
