10:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Hi guys
10:02 < Dune> Hey Sonix
10:09 < Dune> Do you remember if LMS is team survival or solo survival?
10:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> solo
10:12 < Dune> okay, thanks
10:38 < minus> is LMS teeworlds trying to gain relevance by joining the battle royale genre?
10:40 < Dune> we should just rename it to Fortnite and Team Fortnite
10:40 < Dune> boom 5k players join Teeworlds
10:40 < Dune> Forteenite
10:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> possible that other popular games copied it from teeworlds ðŸ˜›
10:55 < Dune> quake copied teeworlds tbh
10:57 < minus> oh hey, fixed the rendering problem i had, it just was a wrongly configured screen size. now there's still the problem of mouse grabbing not working
10:57 < Dune> minus: u 4k?
10:58 < minus> nope
10:58 < minus> multiple monitors though, and wayland
10:59 < minus> hm, since teeworlds forces the cursor to the screen center you can't use a tablet either
11:11 < Dune> hm
11:30 < Dune> minus: do you have the permissions on the translation system and/or know the procedure?
11:37 < Dune> since it seems heinrich will be off all wekeend
11:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wasnt the teeworlds lms code done already before the battle royal hype started?
12:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix Oy just fixed your issue
12:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/fdcb2f26fb582af8a9252c56820fc25456be33d9
12:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah i saw ðŸ˜ƒ
12:54  * Dune summons Oy
12:54 < Dune> my magic is too weak
12:54 < rand> @ChillerDragon: i think so, but the name seems confusing cf issue EL/TEL
12:55 < rand> lms is solo survival
12:55 < Dune> it would be LMS/LTS now
12:55 < Dune> what do you think?
12:55 < rand> oh
12:55 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1562
12:56 < Dune> you should give your opinion regardless
12:56 < rand> not to confuse with last tee standing :p
12:56 < Dune> haha yeah
12:56 < Dune> "man" sounds weird but hey
12:56 < rand> > Last Man Standing (LMS) or Last Team Standing (LTS) is a multiplayer deathmatch gameplay...
12:56 < rand> wikipedia
12:57 < Dune> oh
12:57 < Dune> nice source
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hey does anyone know how to add filters like this ? https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/293850/47602569-0df79b00-d9e1-11e8-8464-e32ececbe3a3.jpg
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I mean is it currently in the game  I can't find it
14:42 < minus> Dune: i don't think i still have my transifex account
14:45 < Dune> minus:  :(
14:45 < Dune> do you know how to export strings or something?
14:45 < Dune> I'd like to make the call to translations
14:45 < Dune> do you know if someone else has the permissions?
14:47 < minus> no idea, sorry
14:47 < Dune> :| okay
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZombieToad> @LordSk you cant currently add custom filters in game (i think) but you can add them by editing the ui_settings.json filer
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZombieToad> @LordSk you cant currently add custom filters in game (i think) but you can add them by editing the ui_settings.json file
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZombieToad> ```
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZombieToad>     {"custom": {
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZombieToad>         "type": 0,
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZombieToad>         "extended": 1,

15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZombieToad>         }
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZombieToad>     },
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZombieToad> ```
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ouch, batches of code don't do well through IRC
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> ok thanks @ZombieToad
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> does anyone know who nheir is on the forum?
16:46 < Dune> rand: do you own the bot server?
17:21 < rand> i do
17:23 < Dune> ooh
17:26 < Dune> they're nice :) altho rifle is a bit cheated in survival :D
17:28 < rand> ho, I commented the error randomness x)
17:29 < Dune> ohhh :c
17:29 < Dune> @LordSk
18:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yep they're great rand
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> it reminds me of my "ZBots" I made back in the day
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> do you have the code up somewhere or is it a private project?
18:34 < rand> @LordSk you can find the server mod here https://github.com/nheir/teeworlds/
18:34 < Dune> ooh, you're nheir?
18:34 < Dune> been trying to figure who that was
18:35 < rand> https://github.com/nheir/teeworlds/tree/server_bot0.7 for 0.7
18:35 < rand> yep, that's me
18:36 < rand> oh, i have just seen your issue ^^
18:37 < Dune> well you can close it :P
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> thanks man I'm definitely going to check it out
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Also I found that having bots sitting in a server playing is much better than waiting by yourself
18:38 < rand> there is a big room for improvement, I saw much better/interesting bot before
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> makes you think, perhaps there should be offcial teeworlds bots
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ^
18:40 < rand> and a training game ^^
18:40 < Dune> I'd love more human bots
18:41 < rand> I loved `bot | royale`
18:41 < Dune> ooh right
18:41 < Dune> back in the days they were broadcasting to * and got banned
18:41 < Dune> I mean they were broadcasting them as real players
18:41 < rand> yeah, i got the issue too, (way after)
18:42 < rand> the bots were headless clients
18:43 < rand> this is a nice but releasing the source makes easy to script kiddies to cheat
18:43 < rand> well, it's easy anyway ^^
18:45 < rand> brb
18:45 < Dune> ah, I see
18:46 < rand> erf, guys are playing 
22:22 < Dune> rand: prefer IRC over discord?
22:24 < Dune> that's you right? https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/profile.php?id=127501
22:31 < rand> that's me
22:34 < rand> and I prefer IRC
23:52 < IRLDune> What's with all the people joining for 30s
