01:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's why you select a few competent and representative people to do that
01:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> pffffffffff
01:11 < Dune> that is the principle
12:16 < day> minus: https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/06/02/411473508/how-well-can-you-hear-audio-quality&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjO2bSJzM_iAhUOyoUKHehZCSgQFjAAegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw15uXfIZtH0wlrK7yGLJf_m
12:44 < minus> those are mostly samples where 128kbps does well (unsure about the coldplay one, all others are)
12:44 < minus> and 320 is transparent anyway
13:32 < day> minus: posted it a while ago in another channel, and some at least claimed they can differentiate between 320 and raw
13:33 < day> that being said, i doubt many would notice a few 128kbps songs in an otherwise raw playlist
15:00 < minus> if the music is rather noisy it's quite noticable
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Mixed 320kbps and WAV for Katy Perry. Didn't want to hear it several times full length. ðŸ˜… 
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> But I agree with minus. The picked songs are a rather poor choice for such a survey.
