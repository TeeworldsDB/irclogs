11:07 < Flutterbat> looks strange
11:32  * Flutterbat starts the matricks summoning ritual
11:32 < masoudd> it was commited in 2007
11:32 < Flutterbat> matricks name is all over it, he must know what that is
11:36 <@minus> it's a list of nicks used for stress testing
11:37 < Flutterbat> im not on it :(
11:38 <@minus> >masoudd â”‚ it was commited in 2007
11:39 <@matricks> :)
11:39 <@matricks> minus got the answers
11:40 <@matricks> morning
11:40 < masoudd> Hey
11:40 <@minus> mor like noon
11:40 <@matricks> well, its 05:40 here so :)
11:41 < Flutterbat> matricks: you are oversees?
11:41 <@matricks> yap
11:41 <@minus> what are you doing in UTC-05?
11:41 <@matricks> minus: flying around :)
11:41 <@minus> south america i assume
11:41 <@matricks> yap
11:41 <@matricks> colombia
11:42 < Flutterbat> offtime drugdealer
11:42 <@matricks> been here for 4 weeks
11:42 < Flutterbat> holidays?
11:42 <@matricks> yap
11:42 < Flutterbat> neat
11:42 < Flutterbat> i guess you didnt bother to adjust to utc -5? :D
11:43 <@minus> how much holidays do you take per year, 6 months? becase that's what it seems like to me
11:43 < Flutterbat> maybe he does  it the other way around
11:43 <@matricks> I have 28 days in a year
11:44 < Flutterbat> and he blew it in january. :D
11:44 <@matricks> then some extra days due to crnching so I had 42 days last year
11:45 <@matricks> I have 1 day left to spend, then it all resets in april
11:45 <@matricks> and next vacation is in june, 2 weeks in austria
11:46 < Flutterbat> mountainbiking?
11:46 <@matricks> paragliding
11:46 < Flutterbat> wanted to give that a try as well. a cheap way to get airborne :)
11:47 < Flutterbat> and its a nice way to get off a mountain after climbing it
11:47 <@matricks> "cheap", well, compared to other sorts of flying yes
11:47 < Flutterbat> yea. not cheap in general
11:48 < Flutterbat> but which hobby is cheap... :(
11:48 <@matricks> it costa some money and loads of spare time :)
11:48 <@matricks> Flutterbat: coding
11:48 < Flutterbat> i gave sailplanes a try
11:48 < Flutterbat> but the work overhead...UG
11:48 < Flutterbat> URG*
11:48 <@minus> coding just costs time
11:49 <@minus> until you burn out, i guess
11:49 <@matricks> Flutterbat: work overhead?
11:49 < Flutterbat> matricks: well you need a lot of manpower to get those planes into the air. and all of these people want to fly as well
11:50 <@matricks> ahh, happens with towing and paragliding aswell
11:50 < Flutterbat> just on the startfield you have like 5people just handling the machines for the start
11:50 <@matricks> if you have a mountain, you dont have tjat problem
11:50 < Flutterbat> and all that for like 10mins of flight if you are unlucky
11:51 <@matricks> sound like towing :)
11:51 < Flutterbat> matricks: i consider the mountain a must for that hobby
11:51 < Flutterbat> yes towing
11:51 <@matricks> its not a must
11:51 < Flutterbat> for ME it is.
11:51 <@matricks> i dont have anything higher then like 60m close to me
11:52 < Flutterbat> same here T_T
11:52 <@matricks> and fickle weather :)
12:00 < Flutterbat> atm the weather should be beautiful :>
12:01 <@matricks> I ment in general where i live
12:01 <@matricks> paragliding is really weather sensitive
13:29 < Flutterbat> matricks: ive heard thunderstorms produce a nice upwind 
13:31 < Flutterbat> theres a pretty good sailplane channel on youtube. the guy is gopro'ing his flights. high end plane. good video quality. and he flys like a madman incl. thunderstorms. the lift in there is wicked
13:37 <@matricks> yeaaaah, dont do that
13:37 <@matricks> CuNims are not to be toyed with
13:38 <@matricks> even airliners avoid them
13:46 < Flutterbat> that guy gets like 20m/s lift in there iirc. its insane :D
21:20 < Flutterbat> matricks: thats the video i was talking about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gR8TPG-r_M
