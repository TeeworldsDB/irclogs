13:06 < tomew> Hi, how I can compile the newest teeworlds version using bam? There missing some includes like SDL.h
13:09 < JulianAssange> install sdl
13:10 < JulianAssange> if you're using ubuntu, `apt-get install libsdl'
13:11 <@matricks> libsdl-dev
13:11 < JulianAssange> yolo
13:12 <@matricks> get some swag
13:13 < tomew> Using Windows.
13:13 < JulianAssange> no idea then
13:13 < tomew> matricks: Any idea?
13:19 <@matricks> well, yes and no.. I would say start using an operating system... but that isn't the answer you want... and I'm not gonna spend an hour guiding you on how to compile everything
13:20 < JulianAssange> tomew: http://bit.ly/1DD5Ah1 :)
13:22 < JulianAssange> or: http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php (the development libraries)
13:28 < tomew> matricks: It's not my fault that SDL not supported automatically in the newest source anymore so do not talk you out.
13:28 < tomew> Thank you JulianAssange.
13:29 <@matricks> SDL is supported
13:30 < tomew> http://puu.sh/esuER/92bc631a91.png
13:30 < tomew> Sure.
13:30 <@matricks> you need to have it installed
13:30 <@matricks> same with freetype
13:30 <@matricks> we don't supply it with the source code anymore
13:30 < tomew> And how it was handled in <0.6.3?
13:31 < tomew> Why?
13:31 <@matricks> because it's not a part of the project
13:31 <@matricks> usually, you never ship other libraries with your source
13:31 < tomew> Thats damn stupid.
13:31 <@matricks> no
13:31 < tomew> You had it over years included...
13:31 < tomew> That can not be the real reason.
13:32 <@matricks> yes, for some convinience because windows is a pain
13:32 < tomew> That's true but the most developers for clients using windows.
13:32 <@matricks> but you shouldn't ship libraries with your source, you should use the system-version so it can be patched indepentently from your application
13:32 <@matricks> and developers should know how to deal with libraries etc
13:34 <@matricks> and SDL is fairly big library as well
13:34 < JulianAssange> 14:32 < tomew> That's true but the most developers for clients using windows.
13:34 < JulianAssange> wat
13:35 < JulianAssange> anyways, use gentoo
13:36 <@matricks> I think he got a bit pissed
13:37 < JulianAssange> he got his answer and should have left then
