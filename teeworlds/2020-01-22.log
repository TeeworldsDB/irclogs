01:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what do you guys think about hashing rcon passwords before sending them? So i can feel more save when using same pw for online banking and i auth in public wifi without vpn ðŸ™‚
01:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it doesnt protect the actual tw server but at least the password
01:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Would be cool
01:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> regarding the tokens being sent to the masterserver, how often do they need to be renewed? on every request or only once until the dawn of time? or maybe something in between?
01:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, seemingly on every request ðŸ˜®
13:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 every ten seconds IIRC
13:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon first, please don't use reuse passwords, use a password manager
13:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> then, hashing the password with a standard hash like SHA256 doesn't actually do anything good for your weak password, the password hash is now known to the attacker and can be attacked offline
13:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hashing it with something like PKBKDF2 would make the server prone to DoS if not guarded against
13:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, I kind of sent the token handshake, and two continuous server list requests and my test kinda failed with a header mismatch
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> put the token part bedore every request, but would love to give that go implementation more performance compared to the python implementation.
13:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the IPv6 ip parsing from binary seems to be incorrect in the python tw_api.py script ._.
13:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> `._.`
13:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> okay, apparently every 10 seconds
13:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> *16 seconds
13:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 16 seconds then, ok :)
13:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> IPv6 parsing is wrong in what way?
13:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> aren't there only IPv6 addresses in the server list, with a special prefix for IPv4 addresses?
13:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, we don't have ipv6 servers for testing ._.
13:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hmm I see. But still if its a like 8 digit long password i would not be able to crack the SHA256 @heinrich5991
13:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not digit char xd
13:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Ipv6 seems to have two bytes encoded as hex values in between each colon :
13:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 4 hex values each
13:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what happens there seems to be the same as for ipv4, it seems to encode one byte between each colon
13:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as hex
13:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> so 2 hex values
13:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Ideally having a bunch of SHA keys would be ideal in Teeworlds :) you could automatically login to any server you have access to by sending your pub keys
13:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that would be awesome
13:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as in 0.6, maybe still it's rather easy to habe a honey pot server running that collects login attempts
13:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> But the ability to give people a password is important too, for convenience ^^' so probably not worth the effort and bloat
13:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea and key means managing the config when switching devices
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> or we need teecloud for autmatic syncing and accounts :DDDD
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> here the ipv6 part tested
14:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/669533230185316374/Bildschirmfoto_2020-01-22_um_14.24.50.png
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 I know performing a SHA256 is not perfect but better than nothing imo. Im sure in some cases it improves security at least a bit. We already have sha256 code so that should not add too much bloat. Or is sha256 also a dos vector already?
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what's the difference between having your sha256 string vs having your password in regard to gaining access to your rcon?
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so it is saved to use the password in multiple places @jxsl13 because if somebody sniffes my teeworlds traffic he never sees the actual password
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so i can type in my easy to remmber password like "bunnybunny400" and use the same pw for my online banking ðŸ˜„
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the attacker only gets a hash
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and "bunnybunny400" doesnt show up in wireshark anymore
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if somone sniffs your traffic, that person knows your sha256 string and might use that to gain access?
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well my bank does not allow to enter a prehashed pw they want "bunnybunny400"
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so he has to crack it first
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> why does he have to crack it ._.
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> you know how hashing works right?
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> not enough, I guess
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> your pw is hashed
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and the hash sent to the server
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> am I right?
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the user types in bunnybunny400 in his client and the client then performs a sha256 locally and sends c4a5d06e0307dc3dfc208216eb31e5ef73efedaffc0390c83d6925a59b8f66a8 to the server
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so c4a5d06e0307dc3dfc208216eb31e5ef73efedaffc0390c83d6925a59b8f66a8 can be sniffed
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the server then looks at the config and hashes sv_rcon_password and then compares
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what happens if somone knows your hash and sends it to that server?
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nothing
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the server compares it against its own hash and he gains access?
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/669537772750766090/unknown.png
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it would be wrong password
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh wait
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I mean you can use a modified client in order not to hash that again
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah no
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sorry me brainded
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the teeworlds server is not protectet
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so sniffing the password and gaining rcon is possible
14:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but the password it self is not leaked
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so even if he hacked my tw server he doesnt know my fav password is bunnybunny400
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it would only protect the pw from being leaked, but not prevent people from gaining access to random rcon
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm k
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> which is a good thing if you think about how many people reuse passwords
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, if somone tells everyone where they reuse their rcon password as well, that might be another potential risk that needs fixing
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> fixing humans is hard
14:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *uses hammer*
14:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> "People reuse passwords"
14:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> Im glad i dont do that, each one of identifyy servers has a different password, with numbers and stuff
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> oof, numbers + stuff ðŸ˜„ -> max length 10 -> "[\d]+stuff"
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> >:D
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I don't talk about passwords, I just set my ban time high enough
14:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> x)
14:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> lol
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> Im implementing noby's anticheat system on most of my servers now
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ðŸ˜® is it open source?
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> No its not
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :sadbunny:
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> I just got the source, bc he hosts a server for us
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> But i aint sharing it
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> open source all the way ðŸ˜®
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what servers are going to be having that? what mods?
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> Vanilla ones i guess
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> oof
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> Not really needed for block/ddrce servers
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> don't host them as vanilla
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or you might get a master server ban
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> like ctf+
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> Ye im aware
14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok :0
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> well on 0.6 are already "vanilla" servers which are modified
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> for months/years
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> report -> get them banned
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> who even reports them if they dont change gameplay
14:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you can ðŸ˜®
14:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> yea, but devs or the ones which are responsible for the game should take a look into the game sometimes
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think I have seen Oy once ingame
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> Dune plays actively
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Devs are not resposible for master bans
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> I have seen oy too
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and which modified servers are you talking about @ShootXen ?
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> Dont worry about xen, xen is always complaining about something
14:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> All kind of people :D, would be boring otherwise
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ShootXen if you see modified servers displaying vanilla gametypes, you can report them with their IP here
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> That's how it has always worked
15:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Surely you'll understand we don't have time to personally check every 0.6 server
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune he was talking about my servers
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ban them!
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ðŸ˜®
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> I guess how that goes with the skript is a matter of opinion but I guess that should be fine
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon you're not running modified servers as CTF, are you?
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> my problem is, that when I restart servers too fast, that they cannot rebind the econ socket... is there a way to fix that ._.
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> /econ port
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> his server is not modified, it just uses some, I call it, econ-strap-on extension ðŸ˜„
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no but its easy to think that @Dune
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Ah, it's the econ servers, I see
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> cheeky password "number and stuff"
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> my dictionairy attack has it in a second
17:33 < rand> smth is weird with some ddnet server, they appear to announce 0 as PlayerSlots (while having connected players)
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Thats probably my bad
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> When I have time I will fix it
18:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Dont ban those, they rely on my source, I made some mistake I guess
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon no, using plain SHA256 will just give you a false sense of security for your insecure password
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon DON'T REUSE PASSWORDS
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if you do right now, get a password manager and make sure all your new passwords are unique
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I live a dangerous life :0
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> don't reuse passwords :<
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> writing passwords down, using a password manager are all better than reusing passwords
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://haveibeenpwned.com/
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yy ik
18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i do not use my tw passwords for anything else but still..
18:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> then SHA256ing wouldn't help you at all
18:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but even if you'd do that, a simple SHA256 does not save your weak password
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not me but maybe others
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh and btw am i the only one who is afraight of entering real passwords in https://haveibeenpwned.com/ ?
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> enter your mail instead
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea did that
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> woot im pwned xd
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> does it say where?
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> am i blind?
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> maybe you need to confirm the email address first
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah younow
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but that only leaks my younow pw not my actual mail pw huh?
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i almost shit my pants
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> this is public leaks only btw
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you are getting informed via email, what breach your email is part of.
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i guess public leaks are the worst
19:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does solofng have a ranking?
19:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> give it a ranking, people love rankings
19:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> x)
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I got a ranking repo actually for anyone to use it ðŸ˜®
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but only with redis and sqlite support.
19:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (and only cmake)
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes it has a ranking
20:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i use files and i have a annoying bug that sometimes breaks everything xd
20:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ðŸ˜„
20:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> just tell people it has ranking
20:36 < rand> @fokkonaut : I didn't find the origin on ddnet/ddnet7 repo (github)
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ?
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I will look into it.
