17:09 < PsychoGod> who can answer please... how was made audios in teeworlds ? with what program ? have someone project files for it or something to help to made identical sounds ? thx for answer <3
17:10  * matricks points towards teetow 
17:10 <@minus> 't was made be drunk teetow
17:11 <@minus> also, by speeding shit up
17:13 < PsychoGod> https://github.com/teetow/TeeVegas
17:13 < PsychoGod> someone knows what it is ?
17:13 <@matricks> "TeeVegas is a set of scripts and tools to make Sony Vegas more usable for sound designers"
17:14 <@matricks> http://www.teevegas.com/
17:17 <@minus> oh, that's not even outdated
17:34 < PsychoGod> what about main theme?
17:34 <@matricks> teetow
17:35 <@matricks> probably in cubase
17:51 <@minus> cube? i don't like that movie
18:02 < PsychoGod> btw, why client_data and server_data (generated files) are same ? better delete duplicate files and use data (generated file) for both, client and server ?
18:06 <@matricks> they shouldn't have to be
18:06 < PsychoGod> but they are... or i wrong ?
18:06 <@matricks> yeah, except some header info
18:07 < PsychoGod> headers are the same too
18:07 < PsychoGod> so
18:07 <@matricks> no, some header guards etc
18:07 <@matricks> but yeah, they are the same
18:08 <@matricks> yeah, the server shouldn't have to know all that stuff
18:08 < PsychoGod> so this is bug? i don't yet look where server_data used, but if we have this files, server don't need some of declarations ?
18:09 <@matricks> the server only needs to know about some weapon and pickup stuff
18:09 < PsychoGod> sounds? they send some of them too
18:09 <@matricks> no
18:11 < PsychoGod> server only needs list of sounds, images, other, it doesn't need to load it, right ?
18:11 <@matricks> no, it doesn't need any of that
18:11 <@matricks> it just needs to know the spawn times of items and some weapon duration stuff
18:12 < PsychoGod> GameServer()->CreateSound(m_Pos, SOUND_PICKUP_ARMOR);  what about this ?
18:14 <@matricks> those are enums that are embedded into the protocol
18:14 <@matricks> protocol.h
18:34 < EastByte> the first thing I do when setting up a vps
18:34 < EastByte> compiling teeworlds and setting up a server
19:44 < PsychoGod> CNetMsg_Cl_SetTeam *pMsg = (CNetMsg_Cl_SetTeam *)m_aMsgData;             (void)pMsg;             who can explain for what needed (void)pMsg;  ?  thx for answer <3
19:44 <@matricks> what line?
19:45 <@matricks> it's a common technique to get rid of the unused variable warning
19:46 <@minus> if there's an unused variable warning i usually just comment out the parameter in the parameter list
19:47 < PsychoGod> strange technique :D
19:48 <@matricks> very common
19:49 <@minus> ugly
19:54 <@minus> matricks: ain't commenting out better?
19:54 <@matricks> both of em works, but I don't like leaving deadcode behind
19:55 <@matricks> and in that case, you can't do it
22:29 < PsychoGod> in 0.7 version, there aren't bam release, bam client_release and other configs for bam ?
22:30 <@matricks> game, client, server
22:31 < PsychoGod> but always on debug ?
22:31 <@matricks> default is debug
22:32 <@matricks> bam conf=release game for example
22:32 <@matricks> or
22:32 <@matricks> bam conf=release,debug game
22:34 <@minus> right, i should finish that up
22:34 <@minus> but i have other things to do
22:34 <@matricks> like black jack, and hookers
22:34 <@matricks> minus: fiddled a bit more with rust, that language is shaping up nicely
22:36 <@matricks> now, movie time
22:36 <@minus> :)
22:36 <@minus> fiddled with angularjs, not as much as a pain as i remember js, but still bad
22:37 < heinrich5991> rust is where you'll fall in love with the type system
22:37 < heinrich5991> (well actually haskell is that place)
22:58 < PsychoGod> bam -c all now don't delete obj's ?
22:59 <@minus> you need to use it with the right config
23:07 < heinrich5991> bam -c real_all
23:07 < heinrich5991> </troll>
23:07 < PsychoGod> xD
23:07 < PsychoGod> better rd build ;D
23:07 <@minus> right config = the one you used to build stuff
23:07 <@minus> night
23:43 < teetow> PsychoGod: what exactly do you want to know about the sfx?
23:44 < PsychoGod> i want to add some more staff like your sound and music, so want to know how you do this and may be some project files for programs would be helpful too :)
23:44 < teetow> don't have the project files anymore, they died with a harddrive in 2005
23:45 < teetow> but you really shouldn't need them, just emulate the style as is
23:45 < teetow> pitched-up, crisp, very focused
23:45 < teetow> what sounds are you adding?
23:46 < PsychoGod> i thought about some godzillaz RRRrrRRrrR and some music theme changes xD
23:46 < teetow> wat
23:46 < teetow> godzillas? =)
23:47 < PsychoGod> yeah, adding some monsters in game )
23:47 < teetow> then you definitely won't need my project files =)
23:47 < teetow> that's obviously something you'll have to record
23:47 < teetow> (or purchase, but I prefer recording monster sounds, it's more fun)
23:48 < PsychoGod> don't have any godzilla near me to record xD
23:48 < PsychoGod> thx anyway, i'l try something ;)
23:48 < teetow> np
23:49 < teetow> I love how cubase takes ten minutes from End process to actually ending the process
23:49 < teetow> maybe German labor laws require a ten-minute break every hour?
23:50 < PsychoGod> worked in propellerheads and frutty for music, so
23:51 < teetow> I really can't work in those programs
23:51 < teetow> they're tailored towards electronica, they don't scale particularly well
23:52 < teetow> great for making little 8-bars, though. more like a game than a DAW
23:52 < PsychoGod> ok, will try it
23:53 < teetow> was just commenting, you use what you're comfortable with =9
23:59 <@matricks> :P
