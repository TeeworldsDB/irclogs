00:05 < Ich_> Good evening. I am having a question about bam if thats okay.
00:09 < Ich_> There is a important feature (atleast in my opinion) I can't find. Maybe someone knows what to do. How do i resolve dependencies? I know gcc can do that with -M option but i dont want to break bams choice of compiler and its automation. Is there a proper way to resolve dependencies and use them in bam?
00:10 < Ich_> Thank you
00:46 < Ich_> bam seems to do that already lol
02:17 < Ich_> i like bam
02:17 < Ich_> bam_add_dependency_cpp does the magic
02:19 < Ich_> gn8
22:59 < Kottizen>  /help filter
22:59 < Kottizen> :(
23:02 <@minus> Kottizen: /filter add smart irc_smart_filter * *
23:02 <@minus> you're welcome
23:03 < Kottizen> minus: Thanks, but I'd like to see everything in the buffers, but not necessarily everything (read: joins, parts and quits) in the activity bar. How'd I accomplish that?
23:03 <@minus> oh
23:03 <@minus> you can set the activation levels for the activity indicators 
23:04 <@minus> also, buffers.pl > activity bar
23:05 < Kottizen> minus: That one was amazing, thank you. \o/ I'll look into the activity level as well.
23:09 < lvgx> Kottizen: also /set buffers.look.hotlist_counter on
23:10 <@minus> hey, weechat talk awakens previously unseen people to life
23:11 < Kottizen> lvgx: Woah, undocumented feature! What does it do?
23:11 < Kottizen> Or is it provided by buffers.pl?
23:12 < lvgx> yes
23:12 < Kottizen> Explains it...
23:12 <@minus> oh hey, that must be new, never seen that
23:13  * minus turns it on for the time being
23:16 < lvgx> minus: now that the lvgx is awaken it's unleashed and unstoppable: when do you release 0.7 ?
23:16 <@minus> when it's done
23:17 <@minus> i mean, i don't know any more than you. i don't really have anything to do with it other than uploading the files (and maybe building the linux release) when it's released
23:19 < lvgx> > 2015-09-18 18:55:42     @minus  no need to bother with 0.6 translations anymore anyway, 0.7 will be released on december 24
23:19 <@minus> that was bullshit in case you haven't noticed
23:20 < lvgx> I had noticed ^^
