12:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what's rather highly disturbing is that when you press esc, the chat is not visible anymore
15:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2162 @jxsl13
16:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Chat's buggy only when you view the scoreboard, as it tries to fit the text into the next line, but there is already other text there, so it overlaps
16:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I believe this is a bug with the way the linewidth is calculated
16:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i think that was fixed already
16:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> are you using latest teeworlds @jxsl13 ?
16:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> how often is the tw.com version updated without it being announced?
16:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm not compiling the clients ðŸ˜ƒ
16:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> never
16:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> exceptions for a few hours after release - we add a note in the download page
16:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm on latest tw.com version then?
16:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think @ChillerDragon meant a trunk, compiled yourself version
16:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm k
16:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does anyone know, what's the best place to add profiling debugger flags "-pg" in the cmakelists.txt? ._.
16:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> are you rewriting hot parts in assembly @jxsl13 ? ðŸ˜œ
16:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I might have stuff, that's exceeding the tick time limit of 20ms
16:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> wanna see, if that might cause lags or something like that
16:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> to optimize it
16:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh interesting i might such thing for my bloated mod
16:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> need*
16:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> x)
16:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> pls halp ðŸ˜®
16:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> bro idk i would put it anywhere
16:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> if its not a pr who cares about style
16:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I care about my style ._.
16:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and about readable code
16:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> since i try to write readble code i stopped making features
16:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its a never ending story. There is no end goal or state where you know your done. You can refactor code until it gets so ugly that you have to refactor even more,
16:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> sometimes you just want to write prototype code that is not likely to be touched again, yeah
16:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I find it difficult to find the right level of abstraction
16:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i guess you dont even have to commit that pg flag and just test it and only commit the fixed code
16:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> where or what do I write i the cmakelists.txt to get it properly working, as ```
16:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -pg")
16:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> SET(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -pg")
16:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> SET(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS} -pg")
16:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ``` does not seem to work
16:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AQfQFcXac8
16:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> It seems that my hair is far from being as long as his, so I'm far from such a state of leaning when to stop ðŸ˜›
16:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd
18:50 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 3 commits to branch master:
18:50 < Teeworlds>  â€¢ ChillerDragon (8d2ad1c): Return error codes on server fail
18:50 < Teeworlds>  â€¢ ChillerDragon (583bff1): Make sure travis srv has access to the maps
18:50 < Teeworlds>  â€¢ oy (9c0684b): Merge pull request #2177 from ChillerDragon/pr_error_codesâ€¦
21:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 you can use `valgrind --tool=callgrind` to profile a bit
23:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thx
23:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> already tried and now testing with google-perftools
23:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> do you know of any tools that measure execution time/cpu cycles @heinrich5991 ?
23:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> `valgrind --tool=callgrind` does
23:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok thx
