09:16 < day> Dune: i see what you mean. imo rewarding rotation wouldnt be bad, but people with just one weapon are at an even bigger disadvantage
12:45 <@Dune> You would need good keyboard speed and APM to constantly rotate between the weapons, that's really unlike anything else the teeworlds gameplay requires
17:01 < day> freewheel mousewheel + left click spam :p
17:01 < day> literally spin2win :D
17:03 < day> imho theres quite a few high apm tasks in the game. weapon switching is already mandatory. to maximize your efficiency you need to pull out the pistol whenever possible (the reload thing we talked about)
17:05 < day> hook spamming is another high apm thingy
17:18 <@Dune> is hook spamming a useful thing at any point? if you spam the hook never travels fast
17:19 <@Dune> far*
18:06 < day> i feel like when i hook around keeping the hook attached for too long it becomes uncontrollable. as if the pull gets exponentially stronger (not sure thats actually the case)
18:06 < day> so i usually just keep it attached shortly then rehook the terrain. only exceptions are playerhooking and when you want to make a really hard turn
18:38 < day> it's... it's a masterpiece http://dpaste.com/053WEFF
22:23 <@Dune> got enough CTF for today, day
