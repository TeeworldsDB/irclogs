20:27 <@Dune> hey!
20:27 < Oy> hey
20:28 <@Dune> sent a direct mail to heinrich5991today, but no reply
20:28 < Oy> :(
20:28 <@Dune> saw in the history that he asked for my steam id to give access 3 years ago, RIP
20:29 < Oy> oh
20:30 <@Dune> I tested with @Savander yesterday, no glibc issue when I compile
20:30 <@Dune> (I have glibc2.3)
20:30 < Oy> that's good
20:30 < Oy> should use your build then
20:31 <@Dune> bam/bam arch=x86_64 conf=debug
20:31 <@Dune> bam/bam arch=x86 conf=release
20:31 <@Dune> right?
20:31 < Oy> conf=release but yeah that should be it
20:31 <@Dune> ah, nvm, not debug
20:32 <@Dune> right :)
20:32 <@Dune> PR was updated
20:32 <@Dune> everything is ready on the forums side, even virtual download links to the non-existant git release
20:33 < Oy> ok. will have a look at the pr in a few min :)
20:33 < Oy> that's great :)
20:33 <@Dune> NB: the language submodule has to be updated again, I hadn't backported the fixes to Transifex so I had reintroduced a couple of bugs in three languages. oops.
20:34 < Oy> ok
20:36 < Oy> you could check if the compile line works correctly. when you run your build it should print the correct platform in the console
20:43 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 4 new commits to master: https://git.io/fp7yK
20:43 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 2882368 Jordy Ruiz: Language/Theme listboxes now always render selection, despite not always accepting inputs
20:43 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master d8392ba Jordy Ruiz: Default general settings listboxes to none selected
20:43 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 6139aaf Jordy Ruiz: General settings listboxes now only process inputs after being clicked on
20:44 < Oy> Dune: next time use 0 instead of NULL ;)
20:45 <@Dune> whoops
20:45 <@Dune> feel free to amend PRs before pushing
20:46 < minus> 0 instead of NULL? std::nullptr is the way to go
20:47 < Oy> we don't use std stuff :P
20:47 <@Dune> isn't nullptr c++11? it makes an error here
20:47 < minus> it's C++11, yes
20:48 < minus> is teeworlds not C++11+ yet?
20:48 <@Dune> teeworlds isn't afaik
20:54 <@Dune> so, you make the OS X release draft, Oy?
20:55 < Oy> can do it yeah
20:56 <@Dune> (and redo windows)
20:56 <@Dune> after the submodule pull
20:57 < Oy> yeah
21:00 <@Dune> I've been battling with https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1792 today with @LordSk, but the "bug" is subtle :/
21:00 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fp79s
21:00 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 44ae120 oy: updated languages submodule
21:01 <@Dune> It may just be that the inputs lag less now or something
21:03 < Oy> could fix it for 0.7.2 :D
21:04 <@Dune> since it's client-sided, I guess people that need it can upgrade to trunk as soon as it's fixed, too
21:05 < Oy> i think i added sth to the server in that regard
21:05 < Oy> think people could abuse sth
21:05 <@Dune> oh, rip if that's server sided D:
21:06 <@Dune> I wonder what could be abused, given that there's a 125ms cooldown anyway
21:06 < Oy> just update the server then
21:06 < Oy> can't remember :D
21:06 < Oy> 0.7 was 7 years in the making
21:07 <@Dune> https://xkcd.com/605/
21:07 <@Dune> can we predict 0.8 then? :D
21:07 < Oy> :D
21:09 < Oy> found the forum pm, where someone reported the abuse
21:10 < Oy> it was about gun regeneration
21:10 < Oy> no not shooting it seems
21:10 < Dune_linux> [5c101994][engine]: running on unix-linux-amd64
21:11 < Dune_linux> [5c101994][engine]: arch is little endian
21:11 <@Dune> looks good
21:11 < Oy> yeah
21:11 < Oy> what about the x86 one?
21:12 < minus> how about arch=riscv64
21:13 < Dune_linux>  /usr/include/features.h:367:25: fatal error: sys/cdefs.h: No such file or directory
21:13 < Dune_linux> rip
21:14 <@Dune> cloning at 70KiB/s
21:18 < Oy> could provide arch=armv7l
21:18 < Dune_linux> freetype being a bitch
21:18 < Oy> oh:(
21:19 < Dune_linux> fatal error i386-linux-gnu/freetype2/freetype/config/ftheader.h: No such file or directory
21:23 <@Dune> am i supposed to cross build freetype from source? D:
21:24 < Oy> can u install the 32bit freetype version?
21:25 < Dune_linux> i installed libfreetype6:i386
21:25 < Dune_linux> but that package doesn't seem to do it
21:31 < Oy> maybe the dev one will do?
21:31 <@Dune> building from source
21:32 < Dune_linux> libfreetype6, libfreetype6-dev, libfreetype6:i386
21:32 < Dune_linux> that's all i have
21:33 <@Dune> synaptic is being misleading somehow, apt-get works
21:38 < Dune_linux> err, linking fails now, /usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.so when searching for -lfreetype
21:41 <@Dune> can't really uninstall x64 freetype and SDL2 without breaking my system :|
21:42 < Oy> yeah don'T do that
21:42 < Oy> will find another way
21:44 <@Dune> booting VM
21:49 <@Dune> err, can't download a huge iso :/
21:49 <@Dune> any suggestion for https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1842 btw? git rep?
21:51 <@Dune> alright, I took linux lite, it will only take 5 hours :c
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> dafuq
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> why such a bad connection?
21:52 <@Dune> the building owners decided high speed internet is a useless thing for hippies
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> oka
21:53 < Oy> lol
21:53 <@Dune> i'm in the only flat without fiber in the whole street, in the middle of a city
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok
21:54 < Oy> oh :(
21:55 <@Dune> seems like bam/bam conf=release isn't enough
21:55 <@Dune> need to specify tools and something else I assume
21:56 < Oy> after bam/bam conf=release
21:57 < Oy> do: scripts/make_release 0.7.1 x86_64
21:57 <@Dune> no tools then
21:57 < Oy> no
21:57 < Oy> just run the release script
22:00 <@Dune> worked wonders, thanks
22:02 <@Dune> uploading the x64 release to the draft
22:04 < Oy> good :)
22:05 <@Dune> good luck with mac. I'll get a 32bit ubuntu VM tomorrow and build x86
22:06 < Oy> the link within the description there should be changed to the release post of the forum
22:06 < Oy> mac needs some time
22:06 < Oy> good luck with your download :)
22:06 <@Dune> haha, thanks
22:06 < Oy> welcome to the 21st century https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbJ8Uh7s-m8 :D
22:07 <@Dune> of the forum? shouldn't it be ?page=news rather
22:07 <@Dune> or ?page=news&id=... to link to a single news bill
22:09 <@Dune> haha that sound
22:09 < Oy> you always could make a cup of coffee while connecting to the internet
22:09 < Oy> good times :D
22:10 <@Dune> I was never allowed to use that, or "I could break it" :D
22:10 <@Dune> can't imagine actually doing serious things with that
22:10 < Oy> after moving the 0.7.1 release post to the news section it should point to that post
22:11 <@Dune> alright then
22:11 < Oy> so when u click it u land in the 0.7.1 release thread
22:11 <@Dune> it's true that you have to scroll down to the news bill when linking stuff like https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=news&id=12547
22:12 < Oy> yeah
22:12 <@Dune> minus: when you have a moment, could you rehost the image at https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12605 ?
22:13 <@Dune> by the way, someone is looking for old svn stuff again: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=122102#p122102
22:14 < Oy> have the old svn somewhere
22:14 <@Dune> I think @LordSk actually has access to that :D
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hey
22:20 < Dune_linux> "We donâ€™t support that file type. Try zipping it. "
22:20 < minus> Dune: can't you attach the image to the post and use that?
22:20 < Dune_linux> they don't support tar.gz? really?
22:20 < Dune_linux> minus: attachments are broken for me
22:21 <@Dune> The server was unable to save the uploaded file. Please contact the forum administrator at forum@teeworlds.com.
22:26 < minus> Dune: try now
22:39 < Oy> Dune usually tar.gz should work, mac is up
23:01 <@Dune> ok, I will
23:05 <@Dune> heinrich popped Oy
23:06 < minus> he exploded?
