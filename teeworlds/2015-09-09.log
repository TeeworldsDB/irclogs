13:44 < Fels> oink
13:47 < Henningstone> meow :3
13:47 < Henningstone> does somebody know how this key is named? "#"
13:51 < Fels> you want to bind it?
13:52 < Fels> otherwise its the hashkey
13:52 < Henningstone> no, I'm searching for the corrosponding GLFW macro :) But it might help how it's called in teeworlds
13:54 < Henningstone> nvm. I can use '#' too instead of the macro :D
13:58 < heinrich5991> Henningstone: you can bind something to #, then you see its name
14:28 <@minus> pound, hash
14:29 < Henningstone> hm, looks like glfw really has no macro for it: http://www.glfw.org/docs/3.0/group__keys.html
14:29 <@minus> it may not have a name, Henningstone, as it's only reachable via shift-3 on american keyboards
14:30 < Henningstone> oh damn there is a difference between US/UK?
14:30 < Henningstone> because I gone from this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#/media/File:ISO_keyboard_%28105%29_QWERTY_UK.svg
14:31 <@minus> shift-2 is @ on american keyboards too
14:31  * minus is using the american layout
14:32 < Henningstone> ah ok :) just found this: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg/420px-KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg.png
14:33 <@minus> heinrich5991: i made a mastersrv prototype once that would sort servers from your continent first in the response, so the serverlist loads faster
15:05 < heinrich5991> minus: that doesn't work with caching :)
15:06 <@minus> heinrich5991: not like you did it, no
19:56 < BotoX> I curse the people that made MTP
20:00 < BotoX> fuck this, I just made a webserver on my pc
