17:51 < Obani> matricks, I noticed something about your old teeworlds map editor
17:51 < Obani> It looks heavily inspired by gtkradiant
17:51 < Obani> (you shared a video once)
17:52 <@minus> the vector one?
17:53 < Learath2> the vector one looked really nice
17:53 < Learath2> think of all the possibilities
17:55 < Obani> Yeah the vector one
17:55 < Obani> The way textures are moved when the edges are changed, it clearly made me think to radiant
18:05 <@matricks> Obani: more inspired by lightwave
18:05 <@matricks> Obani: oh, thats just normal texture mapping
18:06 <@matricks> Obani: everything "behaves" like that is brush based
18:06 <@matricks> also, I stink, I should take a shower
23:46 <+necropotame> Is it possible to have an email sent each time I received a PM in the TW forum ?
