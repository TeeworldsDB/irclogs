12:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune and @oy, can you give ma feedback/a review for https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/3068 ? It's not urgent but would be nice to have for further content ðŸ˜„
12:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Oy is not there and will not see your message
12:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> I don't know how to ping oy (like at all)
12:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> You can't, except on github
12:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> And even the pings on github can take... a while
