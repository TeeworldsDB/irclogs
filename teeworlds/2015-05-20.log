06:39 <@minus> well, adding shit to the stack is difficult if there's something else on top already
19:14 < heinrich5991> minus: the idea was to have a constant-sized map on the stack
19:14 < heinrich5991> which doesn't sound too impossible
19:14 <@minus> not sure if possible
19:15 <@minus> because you basically need lists
19:16 < heinrich5991> mh?
19:17 <@minus> if 2 things hash to the same thing you need a list
19:31 < BotoX> I've already solved it
19:31 < BotoX> with a custom allocator from some cool guy
