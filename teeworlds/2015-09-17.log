21:31 < day_> i wonder is it on purpose that the pistole doesnt reload when not selected?
21:32 < EastByte> day_: yes
21:32 < day_> kinda annoying imho
21:32 < day_> forces you to have the pistole active during down time
21:33 < Henningstone> but forces you to play more tactical too
21:33 < EastByte> ^
21:33 < day_> meh i would love to see more pistole spray action
21:35 < day_> rocket launcher and hook on the other hand are insanely overpowered ;P
21:36 < Henningstone> hook... overpowered?!
21:36 < Henningstone> hook requires much skill!
21:36 < day_> it is so easy to keep someone perma hooked
21:36 < LittleWhite> Can't use both mouse buttons at the same time :'(
21:37 < LittleWhite> (because of my brain :p )
21:37 < Henningstone> nah then I'm probably not pro enought
21:37 < Henningstone> but i cannot without bot
21:37 < day_> Henningstone: are you eu?
21:37 < Henningstone> ger
21:37 < day_> lets 1on1 dm1 :3
21:37 < day_> me too
21:38 < Henningstone> mmh sry need to go now :0 (is keine Ausrede jetzt xD)
21:38 < day_> :D
21:38 < day_> im not really good anyways. only playing pub games
21:38 < Henningstone> me only ddrace :D
21:38 < day_> anyone else up for a 1on1? :3
21:38 < Henningstone> and my own mod of cause :P
21:38 < Henningstone> so bb
21:38 < day_> bb
21:38 < Burki> day_ what mod?
21:39 < day_> Burki: vanilla ofc
21:39 < Burki> day_ oh then no, sry
21:40 < day_> Burki: instagib player? 
21:40 < Burki> day_ yes
21:40 < day_> hehe
21:41 < day_> i played it during the big wave Ms/krypton/ etc. on HuH A LOT
21:41 < Burki> not particularly good though
21:41 < day_> but the cheating was ridiculous after a while
21:41 < Burki> yeah see, I don't even know what "HuH" means :D
21:41 < day_> everyone started to accuse everyone
21:41 < day_> it was a server
21:41 < day_> just the name. THE instagib server
21:42 < Burki> day_ yeah aimbots are a big problem in laser instagib (which I play most)
21:42 < Burki> day_ I guess I've never seen it... which is weird
21:43 < day_> Burki: there was one famous player who no one hated even tho he cheated... it was hilarious
21:43 < Burki> day_ what was his name=?
21:43 < Burki> day_ what was his name?
21:43 < day_> something like razer
21:43 < Burki> oh sry for double I'm used to being able to correct
21:43 < day_> h2xl or something was the clan iirc
21:44 < day_> he up'ed a video on youtube where he 20-0 krypton barli with dm1 spawn kills
21:44 < Burki> hmm, sounds familiar... I've been around, occasionally, for about 6 years now
21:44 < day_> frickn hilarious :D
21:44 < Burki> ^^
21:45 < Burki> do you know the Almost clan?
21:45 < day_> damn that was 2010 T_T
21:45 < day_> is it a current clan?
21:45 < day_> im completely out of the loop clan wise
21:45 < Burki> it's still alive but it's not rather silent I think, and old
21:46 < day_> i played in -HS- many years ago
21:46 < Burki> I think teetime in here is in that clan
21:47 < Burki> Almost, not -HS-
21:47 < Teetime> yea, my good old clan :P
21:47 < day_> well i havent played instagib in a LOONG time
21:47 < Burki> i'm out of the loop too, I just see people clans on fng these days
21:47 < Burki> hi Teetime :)
21:47 < day_> i got bored by it. i really liked it but vanilla has so much more to offer
21:48 < Teetime> Hi burki, long time no see 
21:48 < Burki> Teetime yeah ^^ I've been playing quite much recently though... fng
21:49 < day_> do you remember Z Shrek?
21:49 < Burki> I should stop  again..
21:51 < Teetime> yea, fng is pretty addictive 
21:52 < Teetime> when i started playing teeworlds i played solely fng on blumentopf for almost 1 year(?)
21:52 < day_> completely dislike that mod. sooooo much downtime
21:53 < day_> i played flagball for like 1-2years :D
21:53 < day_> as i found out later one of the active flagball players later became fnatic melissan
21:54 < Burki> I've never played fng until like 3 months ago.. I guess I'm ignorant or smth :D
21:56 < Burki> I tried it because zCatch laser totally dried out
21:58 < Teetime> well to be honest: back then it was more a meeting with friends and chatting than playing :P Eventually we knew everybody which came frequently to fng and were friends, it was quite fun back there :)
22:00 < Teetime> unfortunately :( i prefer zcatch laser over grenade, and I dont like ctf5 with it
22:00 < Burki> yeah back when I was a school kid with too much time ^^
22:00 < Burki> I think I was playing zCatch laser for a year or so until like 3 months ago
22:01 < Burki> ctf4 mostly
22:01 < Burki> I'm not "anti-ctf5" though, I find it fun too
22:02 < day_> i like ctf5
22:02 < day_> because its superfast
22:03 < Teetime> i can't find a good zcatch laser server since months, cause nobody is playing it anymore
22:04 < day_> start playing vanilla :3
22:04 < Teetime> i don't 'hate' ctf5 either but i think it's too large
22:04 < day_> ah shit i frickn hate ctf5
22:04 < Burki> Teetime there is sometimes a brasil one with 200ms ping.. unplayable :(
22:04 < day_> i meant ctf3 i think it is
22:04 < day_> the jungle one
22:04 < day_> ctf5 is completely pup unplayable. you cant die
22:05 < Burki> Teetime I just found one
22:05 < Burki> Teetime find me, Ingame: Burki
22:06 < Burki> ctf5 though
23:43 < day_> when i start a youtube video (html5) and i then join a tw server, the game jitters hard theres a lot of chopping on all moving parts
23:43 < day_> actually just playing/stoping the youtube video is enough. theres no need to dc from a game
23:44 < day_> or join after starting the video. im on linux x86_64, nvidia gpu, vsync is on and according to the fps counter in tw, working
