22:28 <@Dune> Actually, since 0.7, we always know who damages us, and how much
22:29 <@Dune> Maybe this could be exploited in statistics / "what killed you" kind of stuff, although I guess it is pretty clear in Teeworlds what kills you
22:30 < Oy> kill messages yeah
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> who it is might be even more interesting before you die
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but for sure not in fast pace vanilla. But maybe in some tactical long range bush camp mods
22:40 <@Dune> I was rather thinking about some end game statistics but we already have two boards for that
22:40 <@Dune> Some games have such a screen after you die but it doesn't fit teeworlds since you respawn so fast
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> u so you meant exploit ina positive feature sense xd
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i thought exploits are nasty
22:42 <@Dune> huh? it's not an exploit
22:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> u brought that word up
22:43 <@Dune> I think to exploit =/= to do an exploit
22:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> anyways doesnt cs:go has something liek "you were damaged by x people before you died" or sumsin like that
22:43 <@Dune> yeah but it doesn't fit teeworlds since you respawn so fast
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lms
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> dont like it but just wanted to bring that ide aup
22:45 <@Dune> that's true, it could be specific to survival
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is it still possible in 0.7 to edit client info, like skin, name or team?
23:01 < Oy> skin/team yeah, name kinda
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what does kinda mean?
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I mean serverside, oops*
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> So changing all of these using `CPlayer::Snap()` still works?
23:07 < Oy> it's not part of the snapshot anymore. there're messages for that now
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I assume a message like `CL_SAY`?
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Or how to change the name? Can it be done by the server like using Snap, and/or can it be set by the client?
23:20 < Oy> there's no message to change the name. can just be done with a fake disconnect/connect
23:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But it can be done serverside?
23:21 < Oy> yeah
23:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> How?
23:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I mean, which variable is it?
23:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> And what do you mean by fake reconnect?
23:24 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L603
23:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thx
23:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> "And what do you mean by fake reconnect?"
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune why do you use the broadcast as racetime instead of the server timer (top center)
23:29 < Oy> if you ant to change the name of player x for player y you have to send player y that x left (https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L701) and then connected with the new name (https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp#L603) 
23:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Alright, and if I want to change it for myself?
23:31 < ChillerDragon> how to do private messages in irc again? :c
23:31 < Oy> you can't
23:31 < ChillerDragon> xd
23:31 <@Dune> @fokkonaut: I don't do anything. I haven't written the race mod. Also, the server time is useful for other things and hard to overwrite (no protocol for that)
23:31 < Oy> query
23:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how can i use time_freq(9
23:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is it one second?
23:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oy: can I change the name for myself?
23:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Dune: Ah, okay
23:32 <@Dune> @fokkonaut: the server cannot change your own name
23:32 < Oy> no you can't
23:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Damn
23:33 < ChillerDragon> Oy look query things for nasty nudes
23:33 < Oy> time_freq should be 1 sec yeah
23:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh perfect
23:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> thanks
23:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oy, the server also cant detect if we change the name, right?
23:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> on client
23:35 < Oy> no
23:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Alright
23:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is clan changing possible?
23:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I guess no.
23:36 < Oy> no same as name
23:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Well, I can understand why this has changed, but couldnt you just do that for Vanilla mods? (serverside)
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> "vanilla mods" xd
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> gametype*
23:37 < Oy> what do u need it for?
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> changing names n vanilla was always fun and never a problem
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> It is cool to have in my opinion (probably just used to it)
23:38 < Oy> nah, only saw people changing names to insult others
23:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes as i said only fun ðŸ˜ƒ
23:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xD
23:38 < Oy> :P
23:38 <@Dune> Name changing shouldn't be so frequent that you need to do it in the middle of a game imho
23:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but removing duplicated names has prio imo
23:38 < Oy> true
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oh yes
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Who even removed that?
23:39 <@Dune> git blame :)
23:39 < Oy> me probably
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> And who thought it would be good to have no name? xD
23:39 < Oy> we have id's
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oy probably
23:39 <@Dune> Oy: almost sure it was someone else's pr
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Even tho we have IDs, most players play with IDs off, so one can hide behind a bush
23:40 <@Dune> We can bring back forced IDs but I think most people would still rather play off
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hdidn behind bushes is cool tho ðŸ˜ƒ
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but the chat is meh
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Haha
23:40 <@Dune> hiding behind bush is a bit of a bad map gimmick
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and also whisper
23:41 <@Dune> and if it's really a problem you can reenable IDs right
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if i remember correctly, you cant chat as noname
23:41 <@Dune> besides you can have very short names like ` anyway
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> still hughe different
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ce+
23:41 < Oy> empty names are gonna be removed
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> :party:
23:41 < Oy> think there's an issue for it
23:41 <@Dune> would be nice for the chat, but I don't think it changes much to the bush problem
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> In my opinion we should remove the IDs of the ingame nameplates and only show them in the board and chat
23:42 <@Dune> yeah https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2062
23:42 < Oy> well dunno if you could see . so easily
23:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wait is ids in debug menu a ddnet feature or got it removed in 0.7 ?
23:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> This is a serverside feauture, cant we bring it as a minor patch?
23:42 <@Dune> I think they're not allowed on 0.7.3 even
23:42 <@Dune> https://github.com/nheir/teeworlds/commit/94204f86d2d0d8e2cf71e394192148cf6ff333d1
23:42 <@Dune> there is already a patch for it
23:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what does that do?
23:44 <@Dune> "prevent empty nicknames"
23:44 <@Dune> since 0.7.3
23:44 < Oy> Dune: i think some more code was removed
23:44 <@Dune> ah, possible
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> So, do they get a name like (1)?
23:45 < Oy> that was the old way right?
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yes
23:46 < Oy> then it should be like that. looks ok
23:46 <@Dune> yes
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is it?
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Or will it
23:46 <@Dune> https://github.com/nheir/teeworlds/blob/94204f86d2d0d8e2cf71e394192148cf6ff333d1/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L236-L246
23:46 <@Dune> the function TrySetClientName will fail
23:46 <@Dune> so auto rename will trigger
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/nheir/teeworlds/blob/94204f86d2d0d8e2cf71e394192148cf6ff333d1/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L231
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> So this prevent it?
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (noname)
23:48 <@Dune> more like https://github.com/nheir/teeworlds/blob/94204f86d2d0d8e2cf71e394192148cf6ff333d1/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L198
23:48 < Oy> !*pName
23:48 <@Dune> !pName does not check for the first element, only if the pointer is non-null
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/nheir/teeworlds/blob/94204f86d2d0d8e2cf71e394192148cf6ff333d1/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L208
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> then this looks wrong to me
23:49 <@Dune> how so?
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> because we dont rename to (1) if we dont have a name
23:49 <@Dune> if the string is empty, the first element will contain 0
23:49 <@Dune> we do
23:49 <@Dune> I showed you where we do that
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Okay
23:49 <@Dune> TrySetClientName will return -1
23:50 <@Dune> which will trigger https://github.com/nheir/teeworlds/blob/94204f86d2d0d8e2cf71e394192148cf6ff333d1/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L241
23:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Ah yes
23:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Sorry
23:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Btw: 0.6 maps work on 0.7, right?
23:50 < Oy> all hat set name code is gone
23:50 <@Dune> Yes, but they use different default mapres
23:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yup
23:50 < Oy> they work yeah, might look funny
23:51 < Oy> there's a script to convert the maps
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But if a server supports the DDrace0.6 front layer, it should also work on 0.7 if the server implements that?
23:51 <@Dune> Yes
23:51 < Oy> guess so
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Thats good
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Well, I guess I will move my mod to 0.7
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> And start a new life over here
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 0.6 is dead anyways and DDNet too
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well, at least kind of and its not fun there anymore
23:52 <@Dune> is it related to ddos?
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I player some time on 0.7 now and it reminds me of the good old 0.5 times
23:52 < Oy> there's still the ddos thing in 0.6?
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 0.6 gets a lot of DDoS
23:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yea
23:53 < Oy> oh ok
23:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> There was a 2week ddos just recently
23:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> the masters werent reachable
23:53 < Oy> thought the 0.6 masters have been taken down
23:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or maybe I am wrong, but it was multiple days
23:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Uhm, not that I knew
23:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://status.tw/?p=status
23:55 < Oy> ah ok
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Wait, was it possible to change teams of players without fame reconnect?
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> fake*
23:56 <@Dune> there is already a protocol message for changing teams?
23:56 < Oy> yeah
23:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> So if me as a server wants to put player1 in team blue
23:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thatd work?
23:57 < Oy> check what the rcon set_team commands does
23:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nice, good
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> What is the player mode for?
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ready*
