10:22 <@minus> oh come on
10:22 <@minus> what cunt is DDoSing masters again
10:52 < tyurd> i feel with you, minus
11:05 < tyurd> stitch stop ddosing the master servers
11:06 <@minus> looking at the traffic stats it seems that the other master got an attack too but it quickly stopped/was deflected
11:06 <@minus> master1 is still under fire and nullrouted
11:10 < Stitch626> tyurd: idiot, i don't ddos anything...
11:10 < tyurd> i know :b
11:11 < Stitch626> ...
11:11 < tyurd> was a joke dude
11:41 < tyurd> minus: what exactly means "no auto-rejoin"?
11:48 <@minus> automatically rejoining after you're kicked
11:52 < tyurd> ah ok, ty
12:19 < Fels> oink
12:25 < tyurd> ping pong
13:58  * minus sighs
13:58 <@minus> okay, who's up for designing a DDoS-resilient server list?
14:00 < heinrich5991> me
14:01 < heinrich5991> my current solution would be to make it http and put it behind cloudflare
14:01 <@minus> lame, next suggestion
14:01 < heinrich5991> not enough NIH syndrome? :)
14:02 <@minus> no, but it's too simple
14:04 <@minus> a proof of work might be interesting
14:05 < heinrich5991> kay, trying to do that
14:05 <@minus> (plus a DHT-like p2p based system)
14:05 < heinrich5991> then you lose control
14:06 < heinrich5991> that's fine if you want it, but that'd mean no more server banning :)
14:06 <@minus> not necessarily
14:37 < heinrich5991> minus: mh. can't get cloudflare to test my sample set up..
14:38 <@minus> heinrich5991: need a subdomain?
14:39 <@minus> to use CF you need to use their nameservers for your domain
14:39 < heinrich5991> no, I have enough domains
14:39 < heinrich5991> already have a domain on cloudflare
14:39 < heinrich5991> it's just that it doesn't cache the responses of my webserver
14:40 <@minus> cache control headers set right?
14:40 <@minus> when i tried CF for tw downloads i had the same problem though, despite proper headers
14:40 <@minus> but i blamed it on the large files there
14:41 < heinrich5991> I have cache control headers set via nginx' expire command, which probably uses the right format
14:41 < heinrich5991> set it to 10 seconds
14:41 < heinrich5991> firefox obeys it, but cloudflare doesn't
14:43 < heinrich5991> minus: I think I did it :D
14:43 < heinrich5991> only one request per 10 seconds hitting my server
14:44 < tyurd> fap
14:44 <@minus> what was wrong
14:45 < heinrich5991> I set it to Cache level: Cache everything
14:45 < heinrich5991> I thought that would lead to using the Cache expiration level that can't be set to something smaller than 30min with the free version
14:46 < heinrich5991> but apparantly it just works(tm)
14:46 <@minus> hm, server browser only lists 1005 servers but masters say 1050
14:47 < heinrich5991> servers registered at both maybe
14:47 < heinrich5991> or lost packets
14:47 <@minus> nah, the 1005 is consistent
14:47 < heinrich5991> that might be the "servers registered at both"
14:48 <@minus> servers do that?
14:48 < heinrich5991> the vanilla server does that implicitely when rebalancing between the master servers
14:50 < heinrich5991> every 60min, with a probability of 1/2, for 90 seconds
14:51 < heinrich5991> which should be approximately 12 servers
14:51 < heinrich5991> so 45 is a bit much
14:51 <@minus> since i just added a new server it might be that
14:52 < heinrich5991> yea
16:44 < heinrich5991> go to cloudflare.com, now :D
16:44 < heinrich5991> it's down, but it has an online cache by cloudflare ^^
17:31 < nameless_tee39> hey?
17:32 < Henningstone> hey, nice name ;)
17:32 < heinrich5991> hey!
17:34 < nameless_tee39> do you know if i can turn a ghost file, into a demo file? cuz for some reason the demo didnt save, but i have the .gho file
17:36 < heinrich5991> not without additional work.
17:37 < rand> what is a ghost file ?
17:37 < heinrich5991> produced by the race client (whose author is SushiTee)
17:38 < nameless_tee39> .gho file, yee, but its fine, thx anyways :)
17:38 < heinrich5991> records movement of a tee, trying to keep file size down
17:44 < rand> ok, seems difficult to made a demo from it
17:44 < rand> sounds like it records position only
17:45 < heinrich5991> well, that and the tee's skin, hook and the fired weapons
17:46 < Henningstone> hm just got an idea. Would be funny to have this ghost file played live on a server (with matching map ofc) :D You'd only need to finish races once ^^
17:47 < heinrich5991> that suffers input delay problems
17:48 < heinrich5991> I think Dune and LordSkelethom tried that once
17:48 < nameless_tee39> well, it was a 25 secs gores map, Bl0od-dens8, dont know if you know it :D and i just wanted to turn it into a video for youtube or just to keep it ^-^
17:49 < nameless_tee39> and since tw can play the .gho file, everytime i cross the start line, i was just hoping there was a editor or something that could play the .gho file :D
17:50 < Henningstone> is has no mapdata in it, so that'd get difficult...
17:51 < heinrich5991> nameless_tee39 has the map, so that's not what is stopping this
17:52 < nameless_tee39> im "Lemon :D" btw, only gores player
17:53 < Henningstone> pro? ._. ¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹⁰
17:53 < nameless_tee39> na, i dont earn money while playing tw
17:53 < nameless_tee39> so, not pro
17:54 < Henningstone> Didn't talk about money, talked about skill ;)
17:54 < nameless_tee39> i'd like to call good players and bad players :D for me a pro players is the one who can make a living out of it
17:55 < nameless_tee39> but i got you :D
18:57 < WolfAlex> minus: whats now with Stitch626 s servers?
20:06 < heinrich5991> minus: here's your proof of concept: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/compare/0.6...heinrich5991:http_master
20:06 < heinrich5991> use heinrich5991.de as master server
20:08 < heinrich5991> fetches server list over http
20:44 < uchar> hi, exists some method for separating flags to "c" and "c++" files with "bam"?
20:46 < heinrich5991> uchar: I don't know. what are you trying to do? I'd guess that only g++ is invoked for the ocmpilation process
20:46 < uchar> trying add C++11 support
20:46 < uchar> but get warnings with .c files
20:47 < uchar> something like "can't use c++11 flags with C/Objetive-c files"
20:49 < heinrich5991> yea, looks like bam is also invoking gcc, so you might be able to pass different flags
20:50 < uchar> how? :B
20:50 < uchar> xD
20:50 < heinrich5991> I don't know, just observing that bam calls g++ and gcc, for .cpp and .c files, respectively
20:52 < uchar> Is there any documentation?
20:53 < Henningstone> Something like this? http://matricks.github.io/bam/
20:54 < Henningstone> er, wait
20:54 < Henningstone> meant this: http://matricks.github.io/bam/bam.html
21:30 < uchar> yeah thx Henningstone ;)
21:32 < uchar> ups
21:32 < uchar> xDD
21:41 < Stitch626> hm, if the serverlist had a "motd" entry, that was nice, i.e. for rules or so.. (just a random idea)
21:42 < Savander> you mnea, motd on serverlist?
21:42 < Savander> mean*
21:43 < Stitch626> yea, but maybe separate, small motd, maybe for description or rules of the srv
21:43 < heinrich5991> Stitch626: that sounds like it would be too much to include it in every server info packet
21:43 < Savander> increasing bandwidth
21:44 < Stitch626> maybe, maybe not heinrich. we live in 2015, most hosts have a good connection.
21:44 < heinrich5991> it's both increased for the clients and the servers
21:44 < Savander> every single server will send you motd
21:44 < heinrich5991> the servers must answer many info requests per second, and the client needs to ask for 1000 server info
21:45 < Stitch626> yep, but does 100 or 200 chars create soo much traffic?
21:47 < WolfAlex> Stitch626: stop registering your server 15 times :(
21:47 < Stitch626> i don't did :/ it should just register once time, but something gets wrong...
21:50 < WolfAlex> Stitch626: http://i.imgur.com/vM3ndSs.png vanilla client (steam)
21:50 < Savander> lol
21:51 < Savander> i thought, you can't se eping more than 999
