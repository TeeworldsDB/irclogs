18:13 < magnet> BotoX, around here?
18:13 < BotoX> Yes, hi
18:13 < magnet> hi
18:13 < magnet> do you know a saphiroth by any chance?
18:14 < BotoX> Hmm, a teeworlds player named saphiroth, no.
18:14 < BotoX> I know sephiroth, from final fantasy
18:14 < magnet> :)
18:14 < magnet> yeah, a teeworlds players that goes under many nicknames
18:14 < magnet> but somehow this is the one he's most known about in the insta scene
18:15 < BotoX> Oh well, I haven't been playing instagib for like 3 or maybe 4 years now
18:15 < magnet> are you playing on another mod?
18:16 < magnet> I'm asking because he seems to have the udp tunnel you made a few years back IIRC
18:16 < BotoX> I haven't been playing teeworlds for that long :V
18:16 < BotoX> the master ban evasion thingy?
18:16 < magnet> not sure if others made something similar
18:16 < magnet> yeah
18:16 < BotoX> oh lol
18:16 < BotoX> Mine was just a cache
18:17 < magnet> or maybe not, not for servers
18:17 < BotoX> That would allow players that got banned to avoid master bans
18:17 < magnet> he's just using it to banwalk 
18:17 < magnet> yeah
18:17 < BotoX> I mean, if you ban a server
18:17 < magnet> but not this
18:17 < magnet> I understand
18:17 < BotoX> you'd ban it's IP
18:17 < BotoX> basically, he'd need a new one
18:17 < magnet> yeah I understand, I'm not talking about that
18:17 < BotoX> unless he wants everyone to have higher latency
18:17 < BotoX> ah, okay
18:18 < magnet> I'm talking about him evading his bans on regular servers
18:18 < BotoX> ah
18:18 < BotoX> maybe IPv6?
18:18 < BotoX> Or just a dynamic IP on router reset?
18:18 < magnet> nah, ipv4, and with IPs from random servers in datacenters
18:18 < BotoX> Or a bunch of servers with socat
18:18 < magnet> a bunch of those
18:18 < magnet> yeap, with some udp tunnel to connect
18:19 < BotoX> socat -T 30 UDP4-LISTEN:listen-port,fork "UDP4-SENDTO:destination-ip:destination-port"
18:19 < magnet> yeah
18:19 < BotoX> I use that pretty often for multiple things, very cool tool
18:19 < magnet> he also has a dynamic IP, but he probably felt the bother of disconnecting higher than just using a tunnel
18:19 < magnet> however I doubt he's tech-savvy
18:20 < magnet> seems more like a script kiddy
18:20 < magnet> anyway if you don't know him nevermind
18:20 < BotoX> k, have fun hunting him :p
18:21 < BotoX> does anyone here maybe know something about bikes? :o
18:22 < BotoX> Found a FOCUS Cross Crater Lake 1.0 (2014 Modell) for 750â‚¬ on sale, currently riding my mothers cheapo bike :v
