16:52 < Ceo> Hello, I have a question regarding the Teeworlds license. Can I make my own game? With own master server and more functions? I would point out, of course, that the rights are still with developers.
17:11 <@minus> the code is BSD-licensed and the graphics are some CC license (i think, check the license file)
17:47 <@heinrich5991> minus: zlib-licensed
18:41 <@minus> Same shit different smell
