06:57 < user774> Russian shows up fine in chat. However, Chinese + Japanese chat/names characters show up with a tall rectangle character. However however, in my STDOUT of the `teeworlds` client I see the chat message Chinese + Japanese characters plain as day. So my question is this: how can I get the Japanese + Chinese characters (ie. UTF-16 [?]) to show up in the `teeworlds` client GUI?
07:32 < user774> hmmm so it must actually be UTF-8
07:33 < user774> I might need to install a UTF-8 font Chinese/Japanese stuff?
07:36 < user774> well I got all the font-dejavu-* installed soooo....
07:40 < user774> alright I give up for today
07:40 < user774> 30% sure
11:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think teeworlds might not have a font that suppoerts CJK characters
14:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Robyt3> Quote from TsFreddie: > master branch should be able to display CJK characters after #2704
