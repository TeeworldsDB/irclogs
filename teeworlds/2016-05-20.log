21:40 < derpir> Is it possible to hide the HUD completely if I want to record a video or something?
22:11 <@heinrich5991> I believe some clients offer that feature, maybe Dune's gamer client
22:26 < laxa> derpir: I think you can most of it if not all using the console
22:27 < laxa> derpir: http://pastebin.com/GS8Mw0NF
22:27 < laxa> I used this configuration when recording
22:45 <@heinrich5991> laxa: is this the vanilla client?
22:46 < laxa> most of those commands should work on vanilla
22:46 < laxa> maybe not all
22:47 < EastByte> cl_showhud 0 <- works in vanilla
