11:11 < bakalava-tee> I noticed when I join a server and disable then re-enable sound from the settings menu, the backround music starts playing.

15:36 < Henningstone> Hey there, i've got a question about compiling teeworlds: I just fetched teeworlds from github, trying to compile the most recent source instead of compiling the "official" source to test my stuff. This didn't work for me, it always says "bam: target 'release' not found", which never happened to me. Now my question: Is this error just because the github-source isn't meant to compile, or is there any way to fix it? 
15:37 <@matricks> just type bam
15:37 <@matricks> the buildsystem has changed a bit
15:37 < Henningstone> yeah but this doesn't give me an playable build
15:39 <@matricks> it should
15:39 <@matricks> what happens?
15:40 < Henningstone> meaning: it just puts all stuff to build/x86/debug in the debug way, but it used to give me SDL.dll for example, too. Wait, I try to put it into it manually...
15:41 < Henningstone> ah okay, I got it! Thank you, it... works. 
15:41 <@minus> you have to get SDL.dll and freetype2.dll yourself
15:42 < Henningstone> I was just confused because it used to automatically compile SDL too
15:42 <@minus> it didn't compile SDL, the dll was in the repo
15:43 < Henningstone> Where ever it came from. But thank you anyway!
15:43 <@minus> i guess i'll slap together a tutorial for compiling and stuff
15:53 < JulianAssange> just running 'bam' now compiles the release version?
15:53 <@minus> don't think so
15:54 < JulianAssange> what did you mean by typing just bam then ?
16:02 < Henningstone> it is the same like it was before, try it out yourself: download the 'official' src from teeworlds website, unzip it and compile it the common way but now you just do "..\bam" (or whatever) instead of "..\bam release". It looks like it is the same, but in 0.6.3, everything is in the root of the src-folder, not in build\x86\debug. Maybe I am wrong, but "bam release" did (/was) obviously something different. Just pla
16:06 < JulianAssange> the last time i compiled
16:06 < JulianAssange> you would compile the server by doing bam server_release, or client_release, or client_debug, or server_debug
16:06 < JulianAssange> (or debug_server/client) I can't remmber
16:07 <@minus> JulianAssange: the build system was changed in master
16:08 < Henningstone> @JulianAssange: you can do just release too (assuming you have the 0.6.3-src), this will give you _everything_
