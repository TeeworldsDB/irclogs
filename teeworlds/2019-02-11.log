02:53 < Edible> day: that's not shady
02:54 < Edible> its merely the consequence of staying close to the metal, take a look at the AND operator
02:54 < Edible> basically, when in doubt, everything is an integer
02:55 < Edible> take a look at forth if you want to literally see with your own eyes how computers work
02:58 < Edible> not saying you can't be close to the metal and have types, just that C is not that language
09:18 < day> Edible: not shady at all. i think my favorite is "bool a = 2; if(a == 1) printf("a==1"). bool feels like a shitty define trick with a few extra traps
09:19 < day> i get that within the confines of c it probably is the best you can do. but why even do it in the first place. if someone wanted to use true/false they could simply define it themselves. 
09:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well libs are there to give safe implementations of concepts. Can't imagine libc be like "eh we could write strlen but it's really easy, we'll leave that as an exercice"
10:09 < day> It made me realize how little the compiler cares, or rather how weakly typed c is. I never really tried to abuse the type system before.
10:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> You figure that the day you make a class with a constructor C(bool). Almost any other type can be converted to C through   bool conversion, and then it's hell when you fail something
11:53  * day hands Dune an "int a = 2.4;" :p
11:54  * Dune hands day an "int a = -1/2;"
11:54 < day> good thing it wasnt an unsigned int :p
11:55 < day> c makes you declare every variable with a specific type and then it goes like "nah that was just to hazzle you, I dont care about types lol"
11:56 <@Dune> thanks to c++11 you can give up on code readability and put auto everywhere
11:57 <@Dune> who is paid to read code anyway? people are paid to write
11:57 < day> pff. c has auto too. its called "double" 
14:10 < TeeSlayer> I have a negative vote countdown right now :D
14:10 < TeeSlayer> but I guess this is being addressed in the next release?
14:12 < TeeSlayer> https://lolinet.info/download/screenshots/negative_countdown.png
14:59 <@Dune> I think so, yes. Is this your server? If yes, you could upgrade to trunk
14:59 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1887
15:54 < TeeSlayer> ah, yes it's mine
15:55 < TeeSlayer> that shouldn't be just a server issue though.
16:31 < day> im getting frequently kicked for "aimbotting, hookbotting, hax". But that is being addressed in the nex release, right? :D
17:10 < TeeSlayer> day: yes, the next aimbot will have a more human-like behavior
19:32 < day> nice. then i can farm Dune's without feeling bad :3
19:44 < rand> wonder if a aim assist would be easy to detect, projectile don't go straight though
20:08 < day> railgun. everything else becomes lethal via hook bots in close range.
20:11 < day> that being said, im rarely running into bots in my ctf5/dm pubgames. maybe 0.6 is worse
