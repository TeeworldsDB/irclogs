08:13 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> a game showed up!   :/  couldnt join it though.
08:15 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> so, are teeworlds devs on the case for a workaround for the ddos attacks?  or are the attacks them, a false flag on older versions to coax us to upgrade?  n_n
09:06 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> 5.9.72.85 is nice game
09:49 < bridge> [freenode] <rachelfish> There's a teeworlds channel here?
09:49 < bridge> [freenode] <rachelfish> That's convenient
09:50 < bridge> [freenode] <rachelfish> Heya heinrich5991, really appreciate your work on the new releases and responding to my issues on github
10:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> hi
11:45 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> rachelfish: cool :)
11:46 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> yes, there's a teeworlds channel
11:46 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> the main one is on quakenet, but it's bridged over here, so you can see messages in both directions
11:46 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> there's also a discord chat if you're into that, also bridged here
11:46 < rand> if you are into this kind of thing
11:47 <@heinrich5991> mh?
11:48 < minus> does that bridge also support xmpp?
11:49 <@heinrich5991> https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge
11:50 < minus> oh wow
11:52 <@heinrich5991> it's not really all that powerful: whatsapp, skype, signal, etc. are not supported
11:52 <@heinrich5991> or it just shows that we have a shitload of incompatible messengersâ€¦
20:39 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> anything from the fediverse?
20:39 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> n soon timbl's solid inrupt will be useful too... probably.
20:41 < minus> you wouldn't really want to spam the fediverse with chatter tho
21:52 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> rawr.  painful.  no servers found.  :.(
