00:07 < Assa> going to sleep, gn8
00:07 <@matricks> nite
17:42 < Assa> does anyone know, who is currently working on the infection port?
18:37 < Oy> Assa: probably best to cut that chat visual oof at the broadcast area
19:00 <@Dune> Assa: I was thinking of a small margin, no need to align the helper text with the chat text imo
19:27 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 3 commits to branch master:
19:27 < Teeworlds>  • Dune-jr (4a716c2): Improve statboard line highlighting when spectating. Some context for locales
19:27 < Teeworlds>  • Dune-jr (c4355af): No longer display spectators in the statboard
19:27 < Teeworlds>  • oy (61dd7b4): Merge pull request #2128 from Dune-jr/fix-statboard-problems…

21:04 < Assa_> hey Dune, if you have time, can you take a look at the next iteration? Thank you <3
21:05 <@Dune> sure, Assa_ 
21:05 <@Dune> I wonder why the TextOutline looks like the same color as the text?
21:06 <@Dune> oh I thought I had commented on that one. must have closed the page
21:06 <@Dune> I'm still having a hard time believing that logo is not 1 alpha :p
21:06 < Assa_> I can see the text outline - do you mean the annotation outline?
21:06 <@Dune> when I meant to give some margin to the helper text, it was just a bit, not necessarily to align it with the chat text
21:06 <@Dune> yeah the helper text outline
21:07 < Assa_> I think it just has the exact same color - how do i set the outline?
21:07 <@Dune> it's starting to look good though :)
21:07 < Assa_> *outline color
21:07 <@Dune> I think it's set a bit everywhere
21:07 <@Dune> ctrl+f outline
21:07 < Assa_> and should i take the annotation back, with just 2 px margin or smthg?
21:07 <@Dune> TextRender()->TextOutlineColor(OutlineColor.r, OutlineColor.g, OutlineColor.b, OutlineColor.a);
21:07 <@Dune> yeah
21:07 <@Dune> I don't know, gotta try I guess
21:08 < Assa_> annotation outline color? same alpha, more gray?
21:08 <@Dune> well I don't know why it's not the default color in the first place?
21:08 <@Dune> it should be either white or black
21:08 <@Dune> so black in that case
21:09 < Assa_> because it could look like the text you have written, thats why i chose a different color
21:09 <@Dune> I think you can make the helper text brighter and maybe give it more alpha so it doesn't blend in like it's the chat line (not sure if that'll look fine)
21:09 <@Dune> yeah
22:03 < Assa> since the normal chat message got alpha 0.5, alpha 0.25 for the annotation is hard to read, i think its too light
22:04 < Assa> you can simply use the same color, because I made the text smaller
22:05 < Assa> But I think another color would be better
22:55 <@Dune> Assa, I meant light in color, not light in alpha
22:57 < Assa> what is a light color
22:57 < Assa> light gray was the second last screenshot
22:57 < Assa> with 0.75 0.75 0.75 0.5
22:57 < Assa> the last has 1, 1, 1, 0.25
22:58 <@Dune> a light color is closer to white
22:58 <@Dune> I think the text should be less visible than the annotation, not the other way around right?
23:21 < Assa> are you sure?
23:21 < Assa> @Oy what do you think?
23:30 <@Dune> the example screenshot showed that
23:30 <@Dune> Oy is not connected
23:54 < Assa> so text black and annotation white?
