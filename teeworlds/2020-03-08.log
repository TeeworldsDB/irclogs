00:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 
00:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Could you add my client to yours too? Also, I have made it so that every skinpart will be the clientstring if it is standard.
00:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> would be cool if you could do it the same way for your client :) allows custom eyes and hands too, if you have no decoration for example
00:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @fokkonaut sure, happy to detect more stuff
00:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> :)
01:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @ChillerDragon same for you and zillywoods
09:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ye sure thatâ€™s why I suggested it to you ^^
12:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Why does this line not just say = m_Playerflags?
12:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> pPlayerInfo->m_PlayerFlags = m_PlayerFlags&PLAYERFLAG_CHATTING;
12:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Why does this line not just say = m_Playerflags?
12:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `pPlayerInfo->m_PlayerFlags = m_PlayerFlags&PLAYERFLAG_CHATTING;`
13:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ah
13:00 < Dune> @fokkonaut can't delete on irc ;)
13:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> true
16:03 < Learath2> #2484 kinda turned out to be a mess, if anyone wants to they can pick it up
16:04 < Dune> networking debugging x.x
16:05 < Dune> the diff is a bit dirty to look at
16:06 < Learath2> Dune: Indenting that whole block kinda broke the diff
16:07 < Dune> yeah, plus the tab auto stuff
16:08 < Learath2> I'd be over the moon if you could get it working :/
16:08 < Dune> maybe someone has a wireshark config for tw0.7
16:11 < Learath2> It's an off by one error about m_NumReceivedClients, why the client thinks there is an extra client in there is driving me mental
16:11 < Learath2> Yeah wireshark would be helpful in figuring out whether I'm sending the correct packet to begin with
16:14 < Learath2> 0.001 bitcoins to whoever finds the bug \o/
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> rand has a dissect lua script somewhere in his repo
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes pls improve wireshark dissectors
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> for wireshark
16:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> client add himself as extra .o
16:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> adds
16:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/nheir/tw-dissect
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> guess that won't help much, as it's a protocol extension.
16:38 < rand> Learath2: are you implemented the extension following heinrich5991 specifications ? https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/b54a41abce54219c111d5760e3fa8f90eeb2fe82/doc/serverinfo_extended.md
16:55 < Learath2> Found it... DDNet also patched the unpacker to error out if there are no more strings, which is the sane behaviour anyway
16:55 < Learath2> Took me 2 hours to track it down, the unpacker wouldn't error out so the parser thought there is one more client
17:09 < Dune> huh
17:39 < Learath2> Fixed, I'd love it if someone could test it and review it
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Hey, I have some problems loading textures. 
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ```m_Textures = Graphics()->LoadTexture(aPath, IStorage::TYPE_ALL, CImageInfo::FORMAT_AUTO, 0);``` is what i am trying to do. Log says failed to open file, even tho the file is in the correct path
20:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune maybe?
20:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> storage.cfg
20:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ?
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :( just random thoughts.
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> make sure the path looks good for your system / is relative?
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> like \, /
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it is
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> path is editor/folder/%d.png
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and also it does get returned correct in the log (failed to open, filename: )
20:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> got it
22:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/686322526741200989/unknown.png
22:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> he is doing it again
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might be a home server with a dynamic ip, who. Kinda doubt that that person switches his servers that frequently.
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> -who
23:00 < rand> while looking at CPacker, is there any reason not too use mem_copy in AddRaw/GetRaw ? (code is a least 7y old though)
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @jxsl13 i heard he bought a new Server xd
23:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but idk
