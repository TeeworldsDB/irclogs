00:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I did some fps benchmarks, i get double as much fps on ddnet client with opengl 3 (experimental)  on (in comparison to the default client)
00:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what client?
01:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ddnet vs vanilla?
01:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> vanilla = default
01:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> 0.7?
01:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> because ddnet is .6, it would make more sense to compare with old vanilla
09:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The opengl3 renderer, while not perfect does offload much more to the gpu especially while rendering tiles
09:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> It offloads the chat rendering to the gpu (not other texts just the chat) and optimizes tile rendering, so it's faster in-game. However the rest is usually a bit slower due to many shader changes and vertex streaming.
09:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> shouldn't be too much slower given it just emulates the fixed pipeline
09:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The chat and tiles optimizations should be doable with just VBOs which are available in opengl 1.x aswell.
09:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> For me it's like 20-40% slower in the serverbrowser. Modern drivers are pretty good at emulating FFP themselves
09:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> But optimizing the streaming functionality might help. Right now the Backend Uploads the vertex data for each draw call. You could just upload all at once since it's already saved in the commandbuffer
09:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Btw... It does not make sense to compare ddnet with vanilla 0.7.
09:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Ddnet has gfx_finish 0. That leads to higher fps but also higher input latencies in some cases
09:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> There are still people playing tw who use opengl 1.x cards =\
09:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12616
09:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Oy added the tileset fallback system for him
10:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> lol
10:31 < ChillerDragon> also there is arbok who is forced to play 0.6 because the 0.7 wont start on his windows xp system :/
10:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> he should send his cpu to a museum
10:31 < ChillerDragon> not every1 is as rich as u mr snob Learath2
10:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> some poeple should really upgrade their setup once in a while <.<
10:32 < ChillerDragon> arrogant mac user
10:32 < ChillerDragon> :D joke joke i love u Learath
10:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I think there are even pentiums with opengl3 on their builtin
10:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> can we collect new pc parts for arbok?
10:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i have a lot of spare parts here for free <.<
10:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Pentium G3258 has opengl 4 support üòõ
10:35 < ChillerDragon> nice Assa
10:35 < ChillerDragon> i have a broken macbook that i can contribute :D
10:35 < ChillerDragon> it has no drive or screen
10:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i have a very old sata harddrive here if you need one xD
10:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I have a g3258
10:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> xD
10:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I've seen people get 4.2ghz on that thing, very impressive
10:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what? That is actually impressive, what is the base speed?
10:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> from 3.2ghz up to 4.2 is really impressive
10:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Don't use Windows XP on a PC that's connected to the internet. Install Linux with some lightweight environment but don't use unsupported systems... Supporting XP should not be a problem but I'm against it
10:59 < ChillerDragon> well thats the first thing i said redix
11:00 < ChillerDragon> but u can not force people to use a specific os if the current one runs fine and the users are not technical or motivated. But I think he was considering it as a option
11:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> When his OS is vulnerable he should update... He's responsible for his own data but an infected machine could also be a threat for others (as part of a botnet or whatever).
13:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does not run fine, because Teeworlds does not run.
13:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :D
13:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if Teeworlds does not run, it's time for a new potato.
13:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> brother's old machine was like monster in 2000s. hehe, teeworlds was ran so great... now, this veteran can't run it with >5 fps.
13:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> my win95 doesn't run teeworlds, pls support again
13:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I guess unlike win95, people do still run winxp
13:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> guys, my IBM 650 doesn't run teeworlds anymore
13:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> also punch card release when?
13:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> my –≠–í–ú –í–∏—Ç—è–∑—å can't display teeworlds gui normally. can someone help me with this problem, huh?
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> my –≠–í–ú –í–∏—Ç—è–∑—å can't display teeworlds gui normally. can anyone help me with this problem, huh?
13:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> does it support opengl1?
13:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> We should add a software renderer as fallback :D
13:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ncurses renderer so I can play on my VIC20?
13:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> actually vic20 can probably do 16 color graphics
13:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> VT100 would require a ncurses fallback though
13:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> pathetic, –≠–í–ú –í–∏—Ç—è–∑—å's monitor can do only 2 color graphics.
13:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> monochrome gang rise up
13:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> blind guys, come here
13:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> VoiceAssistant for teeworlds?
13:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Pauses every tick, "tee with blue body, yellow feet has moved, 0.1 tiles"
13:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> motherboard's speaker goes peep peep
13:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <!gerdoe> culmination of absurd is ending, heh.
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> when the motherboard morse-codes you what happens in the game
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Learath2 thank you, I checked my own motherboard and overclocked it manually (instead of the preset) and I am now running on 4.2 GHz supposed to 3.8 (and 3.3 base speed)
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Don't forget you are overclocked, some clocks appear stable for so long before going very wrong
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yeah I know, but I have buffer
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> 4.5 was semi unstable
