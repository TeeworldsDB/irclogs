17:50 < ChillerDragon> I think we should as a community step up our github meta game. Getting "teeworlds" as a github topic would be nice advertisement https://github.com/topics seems like most tw forks did not use github topics.
17:51 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1592409070.png
17:51 < ChillerDragon> teeworlds/teeworlds uses them but not even matricks or ddnet uses them pls fix heinrich5991
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> matricks is not around and his repository isn't very relevant
17:54 < ChillerDragon> yea ikr just to show how like only teeworlds/teeworlds has these topics set. It would be nice if all the community forks could do the same like zcatch @jxsl13 fng infclass GAMER CLIENT!!! etc
17:57 < ChillerDragon> and @all make sure to give https://github.com/topics/teeworlds a star on github :D
18:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Go away chilly draghuhn!
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> added, already had some on my discord bots and server tools, but none for zCatch.
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> GAMER CLIENT @Dune !!!!!!1!!!!1!1!1!1!
19:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ?
20:53 < ChillerDragon> thanks @ whoever did it for ddnet and dune you fine too :) 
23:50  * minus wonders if heinrich5991 or Dune handle account deletion requests
23:51 < ChillerDragon> minus wdym what accounts?
23:52 < minus> well, people asking to have their accounts deleted
23:52 <@Dune> minus: they asked to delete posts, not accounts
23:52 < ChillerDragon> Btw who every has access to teeworlds/teeworlds the official C++ github topic in https://github.com/topics/cpp is called cpp not c-plus-plus so teeworlds wont show up in topic exploration
23:52 <@Dune> Sooo ¯\_(ヅ)_/¯ 
23:52 < ChillerDragon> pls add cpp or replace c-plus-plus
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> please provide an uldated teeworlds topic screenshot, @ChillyHuhn
23:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> updated
23:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I was referring to Chiller's statement, @Dune.
