18:47 < sav_> Hey guys, i have a question. Someone knows what i must do to DDrace-Server worked?? I must have "GLIBC_2.14", but my Debian 7 Wheezy(64bit), have GLIBC 2.13 and can't upgrade it :/
19:08 < deen> DDrace-Server from where? You could compile it yourself
19:24 < sav_> oryginal ddrace from ddrace.info (latest version available on ddrace hmm idk, one years ago)
19:25 <@minus> compile it yourself
19:27 < sav_> ok, i'll try
19:44  * nameless_tee21 slaps Mr-Anderson around a bit with a large fishbot
19:45 <@minus> oye
19:46 < deen> sav_: yeah, i was just wondering because ddrace.info has been down for some time
19:55 < sav_> Thanks guys, works :)
