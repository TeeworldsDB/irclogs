21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Did anyone ever work with the m_ReckoningCore and m_ReckoningTick of CCharacter?
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> There seems to be a problem on my server, I will try to describe it:
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> It is a client freeze for several seconds, which can occur multiple times in a row, nobody knew where it came from. Now I somehow got this bug for the very first time, and luckily I have an auto demo of it happening. That demo, I loaded with a debugging client and checked where the client freezes, and it does [here](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L1089-L1095).
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> The issue seems to be, that the client receives a ReckoningTick, which is very low, in my case it was 4, while the curren Tick was above 400k, of course, that will take a few seconds to process.
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Now there are 2 questions coming to my mind: How does the server even send a reckoning tick which is so low, while the current Tick is that high? And second: How the fuck am I supposed to fix this, because it's super random and I dont know why it happens or how to trigger it at all.
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Also, I checked some values with a debugging client playing the demo, it seems like after it freezes for the first time it keeps evolving the [previously snapped character](https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/dc03672af3735409319ee23dc7c6df0f5cbd655e/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L1270-L1271).

21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 84.159.176.208:8304
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> he is ddosing my server so its not displayed, then broadcasts his own one
21:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> real ip is: 91.10.53.240
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what is 84.159.176.208 ?
22:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> a fake ip by him
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's a home server with a dynamic IP.
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> most likely
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ok
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> done
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I mean either botnet or exposing his private ip.
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does telekom rent out vps/dedicated servers to non-businesses?
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> doubt
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> this is valis real ip
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 91.10. is his range, thats known since long already
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://www.telekom.de/kontakt/e-mail-kontakt/abuse-missbrauchsfall
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> just for the lols
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
23:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <nuborn> @fokkonaut reckoningtick should never decrease. in the normal server I also think there is a limit, to make sure it never becomes more than 3 seconds (or so) behind the gametick
