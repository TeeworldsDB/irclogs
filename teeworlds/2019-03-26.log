03:10 < the2048> Hmm
09:06 < day> Dune: morning dune. missed your message yesterday evening? which player did you mean? did something funny happen?
09:25 <@Dune> #1/austrian
09:26 <@Dune> I thought steph but nah
09:39 < day> yeah no clue who it is.
09:40 < day> it's not rand(), me, or mario bros and everyone else i know playing on that server is worse than him. except maybe that polish player, whose name i forgot
09:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I couldn't get a shot on him :P
09:46 < day> you need to play more :p
09:46 < day> i see you for 5min every 2 weeks
09:47 <@Dune> I played a lot in 0.7.1 but you weren't there :p
09:48 <@Dune> then the ictf servers went away :(
09:54 < day> yeah. that was when tw didnt work on my linux (the mouse stuck in the corner bug)
09:55 < day> i occasionally played vanilla though. stopped ictf all together, i dont like it anymore
09:55 <@Dune> the problem is solved now, you can play with a controller
09:55 < day> is that in the current release?
09:55 <@Dune> yes
09:56 < day> github or teeworlds homepage?
09:56 <@Dune> ah github
09:56 < day> kk
09:56 <@Dune> soon homepage;)
09:56 < day> and with controller you mean e.g. the xbox360 controller?
09:56 <@Dune> Yes
09:56 < day> will give that a try for sure :p
09:57 <@Dune> it lets you play with noobs on a fair ground 
09:57 < day> i hope i get better with it tbh ^^
09:57 <@Dune> X for aimbot
09:58 <@Dune> Huh then you should try it now and give feedback on how to improve it because I think it's barely playable 
09:58 < day> my imaginary issue is mostly that im missing buttons in the right places
09:59 <@Dune> They can be bound like keys
09:59 <@Dune> I think the issue is aim+hook
09:59 < day> the controller simply doesnt have the keys i mean
10:00 < day> i think aim is faster. the 2d plane maps perfectly to an analog stick.
10:01 < day> you also avoid the wandering mouse problem. i always end up on the top part of my mousepad when playing teeworlds and then ahve to reset :P
10:03 < day> but assuming you put movement on the left stick and aim on the right one, where do you put the weapons, jump and shoot?
10:03 < day> all these buttons need to be reachable while fully maintaining control about both analog sticks
10:03 <@Dune> I'm not sure you can even use two sticks right now 
10:03 < day> about/over
10:03 <@Dune> Ah one for movement.  Idk
10:04 <@Dune> Well git clone and test it :P
10:04 < day> well the "cross" would be sufficient for movement
10:04 < day> but imho it's a bit awkward to reach
10:10 < rand> huhu, I end up pushing everything to the right from my desk while playing
10:11 < rand> I shouldn't need large moves since distance is low and mouse_sense is high...
10:16 < rand> I met the mouse in corner issue on my laptop
10:17 < rand> when I did the second PR for whisper 
13:13 < abc> Hi autistic noobs
13:13 < abc> ANYONE ONLINE??????
13:13 < abc> EFZGRUUREGEZRGE
13:14 <@Dune> hi, manners please
13:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rude Dune allow some more free speech ðŸ˜ƒ
13:43 < minus> sounds like they just terribly lost in a couple of games
14:51 < day> s/they/it
17:56 <@Dune> ugh I forgot to edit the cmakelists
17:56 <@Dune> gotta fixup
18:01 <@Dune> I was wrong, should have made the --console option a console command, so it can be put in settings.cfg for troubleshooting :/
18:05 < Oy> yeah, should probably change that
18:11 <@Dune> I wonder if we should add a console option to disable chat commands
18:11 <@Dune> maybe people will complain that this shows up when they want to enter server-side commands
18:11 <@Dune> (on modified servers)
18:12 <@Dune> (although you can enter them just fine by using escape)
18:19 < Oy> hm, don't think that's necessary
18:19 <@Dune> ok then :)
18:25 < rand> Dune: why did you hl me ? what did I say about console ? :o
18:25 < rand> (btw, i played on windows this we, and I did see the flashing console)
18:27 <@Dune> you said it should be a f1 option, not a command line option, rand
18:27 <@Dune> I argued it would make the console flash
18:29 < rand> I forgot
18:30 <@Dune> well you win that argument :P
18:35  * rand shares the winning cookie with Dune
18:37 < Oy> Dune: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-translation/issues/72
18:41 <@Dune> I get print "%1.0f" % 1.23
18:41 <@Dune> gives me 1
18:41 <@Dune> so I don't think it does what you want?
18:41 <@Dune> >>> print "%1.1f" % 1.231.2
18:41 < Oy> that's correct
18:41 <@Dune> 1.2
18:41 <@Dune> that's maybe better
18:42 < Oy> should just display full seconds
18:42 <@Dune> ah?
18:42 < Oy> if that doesn't work, i'll convert to int and use that
18:43 <@Dune> because "%.1f" displays 1.2 to me
18:43 < Oy> for transiflex i mean
18:43 <@Dune> what output do you want? 1 or 1.2?
18:43 < Oy> 1
18:43 < Oy> don't need to display miliseconds to the user. just looks odd
18:44 <@Dune> yeah but it displays 1.2 rn I think
18:44 <@Dune> hold on testing
18:44 <@Dune> nvm
18:44 < Oy> no. "1." == "1.0"
18:44 < Oy> :P
18:44 <@Dune> I thought it's %.1f
18:45 < Oy> :D
18:45 <@Dune> %1.0f probably works
18:46 < Oy> ok
18:46 <@Dune> yep it does
18:47 <@Dune> > transiflex
18:47 < Oy> Dune: are you working on the composed bind thing?
18:48 <@Dune> no
18:48 <@Dune> transiflex sounds better than transifex
18:48 < Oy> what did i type?
18:48 <@Dune> transiflex :D
18:48 < Oy> oh ok :D
18:49 <@Dune> can you send webhooks to heinrich5991.de:8045/github so we can get some fun commits here? :D
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what s that?
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> unreachable from mi browser
18:50 < Oy> is that url correct?
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe the port is wrong
18:51 <@Dune> it's correct
18:53 <@Dune> well at least http://heinrich5991.de:8045/github works, but maybe because http:// overrides 8045. I'm a grandma with network stuff
18:53 < rand> it does not
18:53 <@Dune> well then
18:54 < rand> but, the port might have a rule to accept only github request
18:54 <@Dune> Oy, you have a clearer idea than I do of what you want for the composed bind, better have you write the algo
18:54 < Oy> ok
18:54 < rand> (iptables <smth crazy>)
18:55 <@Dune> well I never managed to open my own ports for github webhooks :D
18:55 < Oy> couldn't connect to server
18:55 < rand> I didn't even try, now I want, but I don't have time :c
18:58 < Oy> maybe some pwd is needed?
18:58 <@Dune> yeah I think it needs some sort of secret
19:00 <@Dune> yeah it does, on the webhook page you need to enter one
19:02 < Oy> yeah, have to wait then
19:03 <@Dune> improving the transparency stuff is hard
19:04 <@Dune> looks to me that it should get whiter when it becomes solid but that doesn't sound good
