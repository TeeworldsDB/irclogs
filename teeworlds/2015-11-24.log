10:58 < tyurd> uhm, anyone who could help me in git? i've deleted some files and i wan't it looks like that they never been there - ignored by .gitignore and no commit, that these were deleted. what i have to do?
10:59 <@heinrich5991> I don't quite understand
10:59 <@heinrich5991> oh
10:59 <@heinrich5991> nvm. you want to remove some files from git history?
11:00 < tyurd> short: i want to delete files, which are in git index but i won't commit that change
11:00 < tyurd> so only for me
11:00 <@heinrich5991> because they're too big?
11:00 < tyurd> they are redundant and my ide don't like that
11:01 < tyurd> its a backup, which i don't need
11:01 < tyurd> *local
11:01 <@heinrich5991> I don't know how to achieve that
11:01 <@heinrich5991> have you considered just deleting them from git?
11:02 <@heinrich5991> like git rm <file-i-don-t-need-anymore>
11:02 < tyurd> would be an idea, but i already deleted them
11:02 < tyurd> it would be git rm --cached <file-i-don-t-need-anymore> btw
11:02 < tyurd> i guess* just to be sure
11:03 <@heinrich5991> git rm --cached only removes them from the repository, git rm does both I think
11:03 <@heinrich5991> you can still remove files from the repository when they don't exist in the working directory anymore
11:04 < fstd> why not just rm?
11:05 < tyurd> well, "git rm <files>" worked but i have to commit the changes q.q
11:05 <@heinrich5991> good morning fstd :)
11:05 < tyurd> hi fstd
11:05 <@heinrich5991> so the removal shouldn't end up in the git history, you only want them removed locally?
11:06 < tyurd> yes
11:06 <@heinrich5991> I don't know a solution to this. may I ask why you don't want them removed from git if they're redundant anyway?
11:07 < tyurd> because i don't own the remote repository
11:07 <@heinrich5991> ah
11:08 < tyurd> but I could tarball the backup, commit that and everything should be great, too
11:08 < rand> you can work on a local branch
11:08 < fstd> morning
11:08 < fstd> (i stil don't get why not just rm)
11:09 < tyurd> (because this shouldn't be in git history)
11:09 < fstd> rm doesn't work on the git history
11:09 < fstd> mainly because rm has nothing to do with git
11:09 < rand> oh, i think i get it
11:09 < rand> you can untrack some files
11:09 < tyurd> well, git knows all the files and when i rm them git notice and i have to commit
11:09 < tyurd> rand: yes
11:09 < fstd> no, you don't have to commit
11:10 < fstd> if you don't stage your removal, git won't care
11:10 < rand> git update-index --assume-unchanged the_files
11:10 < rand> then rm them
11:11 < rand> fstd: but, you can't use commit -a then
11:11 < fstd> yeah, so what?
11:11 < rand> I like commit -a
11:11 < fstd> can't also use vi(1) on the removed file :)
11:11 < tyurd> rand: git still knows that they were deleted
11:11 < fstd> tyurd: so what?
11:12 < fstd> noone forces you to commit the removal
11:12 < tyurd> > when I don't git always will tell me that they were deleted when I use git status
11:12 < rand> tyurd: :c
11:12 < tyurd> thats the point ._.
11:13 <@heinrich5991> git update-index --asume-unchanged might fix that until the next checkout
11:13 < fstd> tyurd: obviously git recognizes that the file has been removed from the working copy.  where's the problem with that?
11:13 < rand> ah… so, it's only about comfort
11:13  * fstd isn't sure hegets what you actually want to do
11:14 < tyurd> it shoulds look like this: ".gitignore contains the folder and the folder has never been added"
11:14 < tyurd> w/o a commit, that the files got deleted
11:14 < fstd> so you do want to remove it from git's history as heinrich5991 originally assumed?
11:14 < fstd> lol wtf.
11:14 < rand> I lost it
11:15 < tyurd> .-.
11:15 < rand> do the files come from the remote repo ?
11:15 < tyurd> yes
11:15 < rand> hm, git config status.showUntrackedFiles no
11:16 < fstd> -uno is a bit shorter
11:16 < fstd> (however the whole endeavor strikes me as pointless)
11:16 < rand> git config is permanent
11:16 <@heinrich5991> only works for files that aren't actually tracked yet
11:16 < fstd> right
11:17 < rand> that's the point of update-index --assume-unchanged, am I wrong ?
11:17 < tyurd> mh
11:18 < tyurd> i'll try again, maybe you understand better now :x --- i wan't to delete files from my git index, then delete the files from my computer without any commits or history in git, because the files shouldn't be removed on remote git repository because i don't own that.
11:19 < rand> cf fstd said
11:19 < tyurd> cf?
11:19 < fstd> tyurd: do you also want to avoid local commits?
11:19 < tyurd> yea
11:19 < rand> even if git status show that you removed files, you don't have to commit it
11:20 < rand> but, you can work on a branch where this files do not exists
11:20 < fstd> tyurd: you can't really manipulate a git repo without manipulating the git repo
11:20 < fstd> and yeah, i guess a branch makes sense
11:21 < rand> then, if you want to make a PR, you remove the commit that removed the files
11:21 < tyurd> true, but i still want to be on master, because (insert something here) --- w/e, i'll tar the fucking backup 
11:23 < rand> i don't understand the reason
11:24 < tyurd> why i wan't to delete it?
11:24 < rand> no, in your last sentence ^^
11:25 < rand> “i still want to be on master, because…”
11:25 < tyurd> i don't want to merge with master at any push
11:25 < tyurd> at remote all changes should be on master
11:25 < tyurd> not on another branch
11:26 < rand> use rebase :-°
11:27 < rand> or cherry-pick
11:28 < rand> (not sure if it's elegant to use cherry-pick in this situation but it might work fine)
11:28 < tyurd> could you tell me, how?
11:28 < tyurd> & what it do?
11:30 < rand> rebase tries to place branch's commits on HEAD of another
11:31 < rand> and cherry-pick picks some commits and places them on the current HEAD
11:31 < tyurd> how hard is it?
11:31 < rand> > http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing
11:31 < fstd> gasp it requires reading?  too hard.
11:32 < rand> :3
11:32 < Oy> how bout: git update-index --skip-worktree [file]
11:32 < rand> playing is much easier : https://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/
11:33 < fstd> hah
11:34 < needs> Yeah more than 1000 players are ranked now!
11:35 < needs> fstd: you are 995 ^^
11:35 < fstd> i'm at work tho :D
11:36 < needs> ;)
