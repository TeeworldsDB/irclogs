17:42 < TsFreddie> Oy: hi, wanted to ask the reason for some of the ISO3166 country codes are not used. dune reminded me the irc rules. so I stated it again here.
17:43 < Dune> (again, not a hard rule at all)
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> just want to say why i'm sending it everywhere :P
17:43 < Dune> huh, you have a rainbow over here
17:44 < Dune> strange, you don't have it on discord
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> it is taking my nick from ddnet discord
17:44 < Dune> do you have a rainbow over there? interesting :D
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i do
20:49 < Oy> @TsFreddie we just didn't add any flags for them
20:50 < Oy> probably just because they aren't real countries
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Ok
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> So the thing is ISO3166 have this independent field specified for each code. The unused ones happens to be non-independent (hence not real country).
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> ppl here started to comment on taiwan HongKong and macao flags, which was affecting ddnet as well.
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I'm thinking whether we should fully embrace the ISO standard and fill in the missing ones and separate the non-independent ones with a toggle.
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> You know, to avoid ppl seeing the country flags at face value and get angry for no reason.
21:12 < Oy> the unused ones are antarctica and french overseas territories
21:12 < Oy> we also have non-ISO3166 countries like wales
21:13 < Oy> don't think adding the unused ones is needed
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> But i don't really want to just ask you to take out Hong Kong, macao and maybe taiwan. Yet I think it is better to have a way to convey the info that they aren't really country as well.
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I think we shouldn't give a fuck and add more flags. I always wanted a Narnia flag
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Maybe we can go the unicode notion that they are just "flags" and stop there. So we don't refer them as countries. Which is easier to change too, just need to change some ui string.
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> And maybe the data directory.
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Something like politics shouldn't be an issue on games
21:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I know. But I'm afraid of stupid ppl jumping on bandwagon. Which happens a lot.
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Normally I wouldn't care. But the conversation is getting more and more heated in the chinese community, which is sad.
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and then you have the issue by wich ISO you go, there are countries recognised by some and not all and you don't want to ship a specific game version for each recognition version
21:23 < louis> add more flags its fun to put a cool lookin flag even if u live like 500 miles away
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> So what about calling them just flags.
21:24 < louis> also someone needs to give me discord access
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I have a solution: add a `winnie pooh` flag
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Ask dune.
21:24 < louis> well if u just call them flags we should include all flags, rn its mostly countries right?
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> this really is a non-issue
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> oh no, we have TOO MUCH customization
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> We are including unicode flags already which is what unicode have. The country ones + the uk countries.
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> imagine an american opening an issue to add the confderate flag
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> imagine an american opening an issue to add the confederate flag
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and now imagine a german wanting to add the Reichsflagge
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> where to draw the line
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> ISO3166?
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> in the end we are talking about a table of pixels
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Can't argue with that
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> on non-ui level we are talking about two chars, so even if you remove the flags, nobody stops you to add them back in
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I don't want to remove them
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> They've been there forever and they are indeed in iso3166.
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> We are just missing a field from iso3166.
21:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Well two fields, the name cna come in handy for adding a search bar for flag selection.
21:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you could easily add them and do a webcrawler automating this stuff https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1
21:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I already did. I'm just asking if we want to utilize the independent field.
21:34 < Oy> don't think it's needed
21:35 < Oy> even when you turn it off and can't pick such a flag for urself, u'll see them ingame by others
21:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Tbh if there werent wars hinted from both china and taiwan nobody would care this much. Maybe one or two ppl. Now it is getting the nerve of the entire chinese community lol.
21:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I don't mind seeing them
21:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Just a way to say, hey, these are different.
21:41 < Oy> don't think that's needed
21:41 < Oy> that would feel like doing a statement
21:41 < Oy> though it's a game and we shouldn't touch that
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Right
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> What about changing the wording.
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Would it feel the same.
21:44 < Oy> well people tend to think country means a political state though it isn't
21:44 < Oy> it's also a (sub-) territory
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I don't know if ppl call SAR countries as well.
21:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Well at least we wouldn't but our language aren't english influenced
21:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Maybe it is a language thing then.
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> DDnet change their to country/region. But idk if they made that change under pressure or not.
21:52 < Dune> I agree with Oy that this would feeel like a political statement
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Fair enough
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I'll still try to make the search bar tho.
21:55 < Oy> and i can't think of a better word for it. nation or state have a political touch and region doesn't really fit
21:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Flags
21:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> :)
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Anyhow. We don't have to change anything. I can explain better to our community. Just thought to ask first.
21:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Oy: btw if it is possible, please make the vote reason utf8 as well
21:58 < Oy> well replacing the word country with flag would probably be ok
21:59 < Oy> Dune: what do u think?
21:59 < Oy> TsFreddie could you open an issue for the utf8 reason thing?
21:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Will do
22:08 < Oy> TsFreddie about the textrender pr: could you put the statements after f.e. a if condition in the next line
22:08 < Oy> makes it easier to read
22:08 < Oy> will take a look at it tomorrow
22:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> sorry I don't get it
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Put the statements after what.
22:10 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2704/files#diff-b09c8546eeddd124cbab6e446dafb29486254042c025434af902307e7826a0f1R19 return <-- next line
22:12 < Dune> Oy: I think both are fine. The ISO norm is a good shield against political concerns either way
22:14 < Oy> yeah
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Oy: could you put it as a code review on github. couldn't see which piece of code were you talking about on mobile.
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> it is later here. :P
22:15 < Dune> TsFreddie: ctrl-f return
22:16 < Dune> e.g. 	if(!m_pConfig->m_ClShowUserId) return;
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Oh
22:17 < Oy> there're lots of lines like this: if(condition) return bla: <- return bla should be in the next line
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I see
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Will do
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I don't know why I wasn't getting it. :(
22:18 < Oy> np ;)
