10:23 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fh384
10:23 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 5a627cc oy: updated recommend versions for sdl & freetype
10:24 < Oy> yeah, will add a fork
10:24 <@Dune> cool
10:24 <@Dune> any other change than the two aforementioned PRs?
10:26 < Oy> fix the make scripts to work with vs2017
10:26 < Oy> added the fork :)
10:27 < Oy> gave u access, u should be able to do everything u want :)
10:27 <@Dune> alright, anything else to do?
10:27 <@Dune> (I mean, to change in bam)
10:28 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1535#issuecomment-433733665
10:28 < Oy> that should be done too
10:29 <@Dune> should also make that a PR upstream
10:29 < Oy> yeah
10:29 <@Dune> https://github.com/Dune-jr/bam/pull/1/files
10:29 <@Dune> is that change okay too?
10:30 < Oy> would add the check for intel itaniums too
10:30 < Oy> sec
10:30 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/f12095fb512a4dc5e18c639be4474787e7053856#diff-9d7e0e7941bdad0765349392ca4ca711
10:31 <@Dune> I see
10:31 < Oy> that first change
10:32 < Oy> about the second line changed: _M_X64 and _M_AMD64 are the same, so it doesn't matter which one to add
10:34 <@Dune> ok
10:36 < Oy> everything is disabled except pull request - that's fine i guess
10:36 <@Dune> hm, should we keep all those matricks branches?
10:37 <@Dune> no issues? should be made upstream?
10:37 < Oy> u can remove the branches if u want
10:37 < Oy> yeah issues should be made upstream
10:38 <@Dune> welp upstream is getting changes :p
10:38 < Oy> now you can do the other pull requests upstream too :D
10:40 <@Dune> sure thing
11:02 <@Dune> it's all in teeworlds & upstream now
11:03 <@Dune> ah, except for the _test.exe stuff
11:15 < Oy> good
11:15 <@Dune> done
11:16 < Oy> about the make script for vs2017, that ain't that simple
11:16 < Oy> seems ms messed up with the paths
11:17 < Oy> VS140COMNTOOLS that we used leads to nowhere
11:17 <@Dune> https://github.com/matricks/bam/issues/126 then
11:17 <@Dune> hm
11:17 <@Dune> we can close https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1946 I guess
11:18 < Oy> done
11:18 < Oy> using the hard paths is bad
11:20 <@Dune> it seems like that variable is still set if you start the VS command line
11:20 <@Dune> so should that be a requirement, like for compiling teeworlds?
11:21 < Oy> well, i'll see if it can be fixed first
11:23 <@Dune> https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/2690/files
11:23 <@Dune> looks like they look for hard paths :x
11:27 <@Dune> @LordSk what is your VS2017 version?
14:50 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fh3zr

14:52 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fh3zi

17:13 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 1a883a4 oy: disabled quick edit mode for the console on windows on default
17:14 <@Dune> huh, is that for win10?
17:18 < minus> > ~ENABLE_QUICK_EDIT_MODE | ENABLE_EXTENDED_FLAGS
17:18 < minus> looks kinda wrong
17:19 < minus> nevermind
17:19 < minus> what is wrong though: the cleanup does exactly nothing, since old_console_mods is no the original flags
17:19 < minus> Oy: ^
17:36 < Oy> oh right
17:39 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fh3Ps
17:39 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 7fd1b06 oy: fixed last commit
17:42 < Oy> that mode is enabled on default for consoles on windows10. when you click/mark on the console and tw wants to print sth to it, tw hangs till you leave the edit mode of the console
17:42 < Oy> Dune: ^
17:43 <@heinrich5991> this is the default for all programs opening a console, teeworlds isn't special there
17:46 < Oy> yeah first sentence :P
17:51 <@heinrich5991> :)
18:30 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed pull request #1949: Remove space xd (master...master) https://git.io/fhONR
18:44 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/fh3Ml
18:44 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 35bc4a4 BeaR: Fix laser rendering bug due to floating point precision error
18:44 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 9129993 oy: Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
18:49 <@Dune> should we do something about flathub? I mean they updated teeworlds on the repository quickly after the issue was opened
18:50 <@Dune> however https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.teeworlds.Teeworlds still shows 0.6.4.
18:57 < Oy> Dune: you want to do it?
18:57 <@Dune> Is there anything left?
18:57 <@Dune> I mean the github was updated
18:58 < Oy> https://github.com/flathub/com.teeworlds.Teeworlds/blob/master/com.teeworlds.Teeworlds.appdata.xml has to be updated
18:58 < Oy> version + date
18:58 <@Dune> ah, I see
18:59 <@Dune> seems like a minor mistake
18:59 <@Dune> I mean, should we officially support it there?
19:01 < Oy> we can, but someone else but me has to do it :D
19:01 < Oy> already have too much on my plate
19:01 <@Dune> well sure I can do it, but we should decide where we maintain teeworlds
19:01 <@Dune> there is launchpad too
19:02 < Oy> probably depends on how much people are using it
19:03 < Oy> if noone uses it, it makes to sense to spend the time/work
19:03 < Oy> *no
19:03 <@Dune> minus: any clue on the matter?
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> btw who is hosting masterservers?
19:14 <@Dune> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/teeworlds
19:14 <@Dune> " Links from distribution packages to upstream project let distribution and upstream maintainers share bugs, patches, and translations efficiently."
19:15 <@Dune> probably don't want to split the bug reports though
19:16 < Oy> no they should be on github
19:16 <@Dune> it does notify the package maintainers though
19:20 < Oy> splitting it isn't good, should be all on one place
19:20 <@Dune> yes
19:20 <@Dune> there are already bug reports on launchpad regardless though
19:21 < Oy> :/
19:21 <@Dune> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/teeworlds
19:21 < Oy> anything we need to know?
19:21 <@Dune> nothing significant though
19:21 <@Dune> iirc
19:21 <@Dune> all 0.6
19:22 < Oy> yeah pretty old 0.6 versions
19:23 <@Dune> yeah
19:23 < Oy> and even 0.4.3
19:23 <@Dune> huh
19:24 < Oy> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/teeworlds/+bug/501029
19:25 <@Dune> "Somehow I no longer have the problem I had. " might be because of the 0.4->0.6 update :D
19:26 < Oy> maybe :D
20:16 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fh39C
20:16 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 1072cb4 oy: fixed some possible overlapping texts in the server browser details. closes #1917
20:26 < minus> Dune: tl;dr what?
20:27 <@Dune> should we maintain flatpak\launchpad
20:27 <@Dune> (https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1932)
20:31 < minus> unzipping is easy enough tbh; and teeworlds is packaged by distros
20:34 <@Dune> this allegedly helps to notify distro maintainers
20:34 < minus> dunno, doesn't look too bad, but i've heard bad things about flatpak, though never looked into it myself
20:34 <@Dune> I see
20:40 <@Dune> Oy: any clue where notifications display (eg sound mute) should be coded? since they should be on top of game AND menus
20:40 <@Dune> new files?
21:02 < Oy> hm
21:03 < Oy> what other notifications would there be?
21:03 <@Dune> none so far
21:05 < Oy> well, u could add a new component for it
21:06 <@Dune> I don't see where else to do it (other than console, but it doesn't really fit)
21:07 < Oy> it's similar to debughud
21:07 < Oy> but shouldn't be in there
21:08 <@Dune> alright
21:08 <@Dune> nothing I can merge it with then
21:09 < Oy> yeah, just menus, but doesn't really fit in there
21:10 <@Dune> alright, thx :-
21:10 <@Dune> btw @heinrich5991 I'm doing a few fixes/improvements for reconvert_l10n.py. I'm thinking of merging it with normalize, what do you think?
21:12 <@heinrich5991> sounds good
21:12 <@Dune> alright then
