00:22 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 you mean the version thing? Its still nasty for scripting to run the server also if it fails to bind the address the version is not logged at all
00:24 < ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 yea sure storage can probably fix everything but i mean as a default does it make sense to priotize something generic such as the home dir over current dir
00:26 < ChillerDragon> oh wait heinrich u also referred to the storage thing i think xd but yea same here i think the default should be reordered to feel more natural
