12:56 < Dune_> Oh. compile-time assert that num_weapons is 6 
12:56 < Dune_> There is a comment even :p
12:56 < Dune_> Know a better way?
12:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Why do you need it
13:06 < Oy> according to the github issue they are :D
13:06 < Oy> seems some people just dislike coca cola :(
13:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yes xmas is the worst
13:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> And the hats look weird while spinning
13:16 < Dune_> Tees should hold a beer for new year :p
13:17 < Oy> :D
13:17 < Oy> add a new drunk mode :P
13:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Seriously a fireworks menu theme would be sick
13:19 < Dune_> Well it's just a map to craft
13:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ikr
13:19 < Dune_> Don't you know any that has this animation?
13:20 < Dune_> Oy: didn't the fake 1.0 have it?
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> No I Think I never saw that
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Don’t think so
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Wasn’t it like teewars menu
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i always wanted to make a firework bg
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> With pixels
13:20 < Dune_> Isn't that drunk mode :P
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> isnt there any map with fireaorks?
13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i have one in my mind
13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Idk
13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Time to get some top animators involved
13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Saavik and HDB
13:22 < Oy> Dune_: no, don't think it had a drunk mode
13:45 < Dune_> Heard chat command selection is bugged when you remove a client command, should investigate that 
13:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea
13:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i said that
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune whats with this one now? 
13:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2344
14:01 < Dune_> Would impact vanillla. Anyway even if you pass that someone will ask why not 100,000?
14:01 < Dune_> My opinion is there has to be a limit at some point and mods should work around it 
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Adding one more digit there won't hurt anyone. Right now it's rather inconsistent since no other UI element had a clamp for the score
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well, 9999 is already 10 times more than 9999. 100,000 would be a very large number again, but with 10,000 you can work nicely, 1000 is reached very fast in many mods
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> E.g. the HUD score or the server browser
14:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I wouldnt clamp any of the others
14:03 < Dune_> Should be an issue :p
14:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Just the scoreboard, so it doesnt get too big
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @redix oh really, there are unclamped elements?
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I think there is no clamp for the HUD score. I'm not absolutely sure about the server browser... There might be one when the get info request is processed, but not in the rendering code
14:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> response*
14:16 < Oy> when the server browser doesn't clamp it to 999 and one more digit wouldn't overlap in the scoreboard it would be ok to add that pr i guess
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> > and one more digit wouldn't overlap in the scoreboard
14:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so this is about extending to 1000, not 999?
14:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no, 9999
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I think the server browser just has a limit for the text width. It can even display times with the format XX:XX
16:14 < Oy> what's the problem with the command selection?
16:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Oy: it acts like the client command is still there when you use arrow keys, allegedly
16:17 < Oy> ok
17:09 < Dune_> I think we should add an empty function that does something like AddServerCommands for illustratory purposes. People get confused 
17:31 < Oy> yeah sure
