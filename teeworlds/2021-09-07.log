05:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i saw that too and thats why i am wondering how this can happen
05:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @nuborn
05:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> my first idea was because of 128p support, so that the client would get another character snapped at the same ID of another one instantly after each other, but that should and could never lead to that, i think
20:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon, @jxsl13: the list already includes 0.7 servers, you could build the client-side part and it could just workâ„¢
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (the client side part is just a HTTP GET https://master1.ddnet.tw/ddnet/15/servers.json)
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> yea thats what i meant
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> @fokkonaut\: when add to F-Client
21:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I guess I get more 0.7 IPs or I'm doing something wrong ðŸ˜„
21:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> with the extra 0.7 IP fetching part
21:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might be that the ddnet master server only fetches 75 ips per server ?
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but dunno, might look into the map structure what's actually inside of it
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @heinrich5991
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I start with fetching the http server's ip list and ass those of the 0.7 master servers and in total the map of ips is getting bigger
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> add*
21:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hmmmmm, sounds like a bug
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> can you tell me a server that is in one list but not the other?
21:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I find it kinda weird that the actual size of the server list is nowhere inside of the actual ip list response but you gotta fetch it with a serve rlist count request
21:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> would be interesting if every packet would contain a counter how many more packets to expect or whether or not to expect another packet
21:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok, found a bug ðŸ˜„
21:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> let's see what happens if I fix it
21:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> btw server not there, sometimes, my server is not in the ddnet master a few minutes at most
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> diff of 0
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> meaning the json contains all 0.7
22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> nice ðŸ™‚
