09:46 < bridge> [freenode] <CharlieFish> hi~ I'd looking for help about server register on master. I have 0.7 and 0.6 servers which used can be register on master, but I just restart those server and I find 0.6 server can not register on master. However, those server didn't collected in master ban list...
09:47 < bridge> [freenode] <CharlieFish> More details (logs): `[register]: ERROR: the master server reports that clients can not connect to this server.`  & `[register]: ERROR: configure your firewall/nat to let through udp on port 8309.` However, I can enter those 0.6 server by typing ip address, and I have enabled those ports on server config...
09:48 < bridge> [freenode] <CharlieFish> I'd like to know why those 0.6 server can not register on master, and how to solve it. ><
