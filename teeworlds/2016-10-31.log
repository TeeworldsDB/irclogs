16:15 < Keep1> Hello
20:50 < Keep1> Hello, i'd like to talk with master server moderator please
20:59 < necropotame> I'm not, but from your name, I could imagine that it is related to bInfMod. It is not ?
20:59 < Keep1> oui
20:59 < Keep1> yes, i fixed it
21:01 < necropotame> The bot counted as player ?
21:01 < Keep1> yes
21:02 < necropotame> You should talk directly to minus to ask for an unban
21:03 < Keep1> thank you, i was wondering who's moderator
21:05 < necropotame> Au passage, désolé d'avoir demandé un ban, mais je n'avais aucune façon de te contacter directement :/
21:06 < Keep1> c'est le jeu, je savais que c'était pas autorisé mais par flemme j'ai pas pris le temps de régler ça
21:06 < Keep1> ^^
21:06 <@minus> English only plzkthx
21:08 < necropotame> minus: i just explain to him that I was sorry to ask for ban, but I could not find any way to contact him directly
21:09 <@minus> I ban u! 
21:10 < Keep1> thank you :D
21:10 <@minus> I'll unban it later 
21:10 < Keep1> thanks alot
21:12 < necropotame> You could make your mod open source on GitHub so people can contact you and fix such errors
21:13 < Keep1> https://bitbucket.org/gwilherm/infection/branch/bModInf
21:13 < necropotame> lol
21:13 < Keep1> whaaat
21:15 < necropotame> Thx, I will keep the link in case.
21:19 < Keep1> Okay :) and btw great job with infclass ;)
21:20 < Keep1> are you still working on modapi ?
21:20 < necropotame> Thanks :)
21:20 < necropotame> Yes, but it's called #teeuniverses now
21:20 < Keep1> oh yes i saw this somewhere
21:21 < necropotame> There is also a channel #infclass if you are interested
21:21 < Keep1> i'll bookmark them
21:24 < necropotame> I can host a bInfMod server during the shutdown of yours, if you want
21:25 < Keep1> i have a second server, i'll mirror it
21:25 < Keep1> thank you :)
21:26 < necropotame> OK :)
22:57 < rand> ces français
22:57  * rand flies away
23:14 < Keep1> rand ^^
23:15 < rand> i m planing to use lua for my bots
23:16 < Keep1> will that improve them ?
23:16 < rand> no atm
23:16 < Keep1> but it's purpose
23:16 < Keep1> ?
23:17 < rand> it will be simpler to change the AI 
23:17 < rand> since it won't need building process
23:17 < rand> only reload
23:18 < Keep1> nice :)
23:18 < Keep1> i saw you added some commits
23:19 < rand> in the same spirit, i m making aimbot easier to make…
23:19 < rand> it's in private repo since this part is on client side
23:20 < Keep1> :O shhh they listen you :D
23:20 < rand> it's a side effect
23:21 <@minus> why not script your stuff in C++?
23:21 <@minus> unbanned fyi
23:21 < Keep1> thank you :)
23:21 < rand> in order to not build on each change
23:22 < rand> my stuff kind of works in c++
23:22 < rand> i just want to test lua
23:22 < rand> i have to make some api for lua tho
23:23 < Keep1> nice
23:23 < rand> i'm planning to leave heavy algorithm to C++ and AI decision to lua
23:24 < Keep1> good luck :P
23:24 < rand> that reminds me that i have to debug my server mod 
23:24 < rand> i still have a segfault
23:25 < rand> last commits don't fix it
23:25 < rand> i ran a server in gdb, the segfault is waiting for me since months
23:26 < Keep1> oh you also have it !
23:26 < rand> yep
23:26 < Keep1> the same as mine ?
23:26 < rand> probably
23:26 < Keep1> error sending data
23:26 < rand> no
23:27 < Keep1> it's a segfault when bot fire
23:27 < Keep1> or handle weapon i don't remember
23:27 < rand> here, a bot that doesn't exist anymore pickup an item
23:27 < Keep1> :D
23:27 < Keep1> le con
23:27 < Keep1> xD
23:27 < rand> ^^
23:28 <@minus> there's something called runtime compiled C++
23:28 <@minus> though might not work with teeworlds
23:28 < rand> oh, i could build AI in .so and loads it at run time too
23:29 <@minus> that's a bit of a pain tho
23:29 < rand> i trust you
23:30 < Keep1> haha yes
23:30 <@minus> (i've done it before)
23:31 < Keep1> plugin in teeworlds ?
23:48 < Keep1> anyone noticed that zcatch server are being ddos pretty often since AppleCider made his own server ?
