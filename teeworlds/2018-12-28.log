02:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZombieToad> what happend to windows console on 0.7? how can i copy links or text from chat now :( are you gonna give use to the mouse in f1 console and make it selectable or make links clickable
02:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can start teeworlds with -c
02:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZombieToad> why no setting for it?
02:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> because the only way would be to show it then hide it later
02:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can also setup a shortcut on desktop to start with -c
02:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Thanks Dune for the tutorial ðŸ˜ƒ
02:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Thanks @Dune for the tutorial ðŸ˜ƒ
14:14 <@Dune> hey minus
14:14 <@Dune> anyway to set up redirects for the documentation? :)
14:16 < minus> no directly, but somehow probably
14:17 <@Dune> compiling_everything should redirect to hacking. should I edit the output directly somehow and remove compiling_everything?
17:56 <@Dune_> https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/commit/190e3297804a27ad1d81edb784c019c4f3c90177#diff-9266540b75421428fa2bf1a3b55de980R567
17:56 <@Dune_> hmmm
17:57 <@Dune_> I wonder why this works so poorly (although it works
18:11 < Oy> hm, dunno if a double click is a good idea. u usually want to encourage people to provide a reason for their vote
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> maybe disabled in Kick players?
18:14 < Oy> yeah, might be better for player related votes (kick, spec)
18:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Savander> i don't like double-click idea
18:20 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed pull request #1812: dont show client id over tee if showsocial is off (master...master) https://git.io/fpSMQ
18:26 <@Dune_> still don't know why it fails :<
18:29 < laxadedi> koomi: heinrich said you were in congress ?
18:40 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed pull request #1825: Added ctrl+arrows/backspace/delete keys for text input  (master...pr-enhance-cursor-movement) https://git.io/fp9n4
18:47 < Oy> Dune_: what isn't working?
19:12 <@Dune_> Oy: feels like I have to triple/quadruple click for it to work
19:12 <@Dune_> it's somewhat inconsistent
19:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> limit fps is probably the cause
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> honestly I don't even know how we didn't encounter an issue earlier
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> input is processed even when we skip rendering a frame
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> so the ui doesn't get all input events
19:24 <@Dune_> limit fps is why - I disabled it and it works
19:25 < Oy> Dune_: try to remove https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/commit/190e3297804a27ad1d81edb784c019c4f3c90177#diff-9266540b75421428fa2bf1a3b55de980R568
19:25 < Oy> change that line https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/commit/190e3297804a27ad1d81edb784c019c4f3c90177#diff-9266540b75421428fa2bf1a3b55de980R573 to "Selected = UiDoListboxEnd(&s_ListBoxState, &doCallVote);"
19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Dune_ double click is already handled for list box items
19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> as oy pointed out
19:31 <@Dune_> ah, dammit
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oy did you realled made this map? https://ddnet.tw/ranks/novice/#map-xyz_ddrace2
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> really*
19:33 < Oy> Dune_: first call invalidates the state, you don't have a doubleclick on second call
19:33 < Oy> ChillerDragon yeah. and xyz_ddrace1
19:33 <@Dune_> thanks Oy. strangely enough it worked with enough spam
19:33 <@Dune_> back when DDRace was dummy dragging :(
19:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nice map
19:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> didnt know you made ddrace maps hehe
19:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so your map was part of the fullest servers in the last 3 years o.O
19:34 < Oy> we had a ddrace server running in the past
19:35 < Oy> also started on a 3rd map, but never finished it
19:35 <@Dune_> I vaguely remember playing it. port it plz @ChillerDragon! =D
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> pff 0.7
19:36 <@Dune_> do you even need any sort of feature other than freeze?
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ima work on a 0.6 map where i use parts of xyz
19:36 <@Dune_> meh
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> unfreeze is nice
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> deep and undeep aswell
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the shotgun in ddrace is important as well
19:37 < Oy> think there was just freeze back then
19:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rifle is cool
19:37 <@Dune_> I don't think those are necessary for oy's map :)
19:37 <@Dune_> with the race work done, it shouldn't be that much trouble to port that map
19:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh wait you are talking about porting ddrace not oys map ? xd
19:37 <@Dune_> both
19:37 < Oy> u just need freeze for that map
19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i think our 0.7 mod has freeze already idk
19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut did all of it i was too lazy yet to touch 0.7
19:38 <@Dune_> I'd like to see a minimalistic ddrace, that was the good time :)
19:38 <@Dune_> where is it?
19:38 < Oy> yeah
19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh then i am the wrong guy
19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i am the main dev of ddnet++ which is bloated af
19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> we have like 20k lines functions and stuff
19:39 <@Dune_> that sentence wasn't targetted to anyone
19:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> id like to see the wallhammer back in vanilla then a minimalistic ddrace nwould be even mor eminimalistic and easier to code
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not to metion the vanilla gimprovment :p

20:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> If not, can you tell me what stuff is important to get it to work?
20:03 <@Dune_> haha I'm trying to race on a local server and am so not used to low ping I fail all the jumps :D
