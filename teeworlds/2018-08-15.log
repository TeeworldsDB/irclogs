21:53 < bridge_> [freenode] <resamvi> i cant join any servers
21:53 < bridge_> [freenode] <resamvi> what kind of attack is that
21:59 < bridge_> [freenode] <heinrich5991> teeworlds 0.6 servers aren't protected against attackers spoofing IP addresses
21:59 < bridge_> [freenode] <heinrich5991> ddnet has a butt-ugly fix for that, that's why you can still join non-passworded ddnet servers
22:12 < bridge_> [freenode] <resamvi> but theres no 0.7 servers yet what can i do
22:13 < bridge_> [freenode] <heinrich5991> either
22:13 < bridge_> [freenode] <heinrich5991> 1) port the spoof protection to vanilla servers and get everyone to use it
22:13 < bridge_> [freenode] <heinrich5991> 2) play on a private server, not registered to the masterservers
22:13 < bridge_> [freenode] <heinrich5991> 3) play on a ddnet server
22:15 < bridge_> [freenode] <resamvi> damn it
22:16 < bridge_> [freenode] <resamvi> kids always ruining the fun
