03:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Assa nice
03:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that sounds really useful for something like race at least
08:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune this console navigation thing is like everywhere where i expect it. Works on my mac and linux terminal. Even on the unix like thingy on windows. Or in the grub command line. It is not made for text editors but for commandline like the teeworlds console. I always press those shortcuts in tw console but nothing happens :c
08:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so thats why its these shortcuts and not in the chat.
08:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I see
12:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> zCatch makes use of OnPlayerInfoChange to force skin coloration of the newly used skin. Also FreeView/Spectating other people while in deadspec mode is also a server issue and handled by the server.
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <＃6909> Is there any way to make a server side gui that players can interact with ingame?
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <＃6909> Like (for example) a gui for a shop to buy stats in some gamemode (instead of using the vote menu)
14:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <＃6909> Or a menu-like gui where you can check other players' general stats like kills and deaths, everything server side
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Dune, I cannot use ready change on my server, the part where it is looking for the MsgID is not executed when I use ready_change
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Do you know why?
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is there some pure gametype checking in the client or something like that?
17:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> in the appveyor yml file just cmake is used
17:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> like for example : `cmake --build build64 --config Release --target everything`
17:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> how does the generated folder strukture look like?
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> well deploying `'*\**'` was not a good idea
18:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Tee adventures does exactly that, it's only using the vote menu for that @#6909  but that mod is closed souce. It should be located, where the server sends the votes to the individual player. Anything other than that is not possible without a client modification.
18:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> he wrote without the voting system
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and yes there is: you can use broadcast for it: broadcasts do have some newer operations like color encoding and multi line stuff, so this is harder
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> broadcast for feedback, but not for clicking interactions Oo
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you can use the broadcast system as UI and the chat for interactions
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> or the input from the person himself
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> like hook (rightklick) and fire (leftklick) and i think you can find out his target position
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> this will only work for one specific ratio i guess
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> or you can simply control the ui by chat
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so you have option 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and simply write 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 in chat
20:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I managed deployment on appveyor for every update on the master branch - but only for windows and only 64 OR 32, i can't do both since they both have the same name (teeworlds_srv)
20:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *to Github
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you could rename them. or deploy the packaged version, which has x86 and x86_64 inside the package name
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I didn't find an option to rename it
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i could run scripts before deployment
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and just push a create zip
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> How do I mark a player as bot, so that people from the browser dont see them with the setting turned on?
22:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Just doing it in Snap only sets the skin for the bot to the bot skin
