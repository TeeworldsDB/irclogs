00:00 <@Dune> sure, but I'd rather reproduce it locally on pure teeworlds
00:01 < breton> Dune: it is on pure teeworlds
00:01 < breton> Dune: almost master
19:49 < day> Dune: :3
19:57 < day> is there a specific reason why projectile speeds do not inherit the tee speed? v_absolute = v_tee + v_projectile
19:58 <@Dune> any specific reason why lasers bounce on opaque surfaces such as grass? :P
19:58 < day> with a 1second delay :P
19:59 <@Dune> everyone knows light is slow :P
19:59 < day> i bet the game is just busy calculating the reflection angle :D
20:00 < day> it just feels like an oddly specific design decision, that leads to questionable effects. like at a certain speed you cant shoot forward anymore :P
20:01 <@Dune> welp chasing flaggers :(
20:01 < day> or you start outflying pistol projectiles :P
20:02 <@Dune> I heard you can use the lifetime of the grenade to do some sick airjumps with enough speed
20:04 < day> i dont think thats doable in pvp. the delay is pretty darn long
20:10 < Learath2> day: also allows pretty cool rocket jumps :)
20:13 < day> and instagibbing players, because they get an undodgable barrage of nades on their head
20:15 < day> the divebomb on ctf5 is my favorite :p
20:33 < koomi> Dune: re the reuseport thing, check if you have sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1 on your box, that would explain why you can't reproduce the problem
20:34 <@Dune> hm, can't I disconnect it from the internet and try, koomi ?
20:34 < koomi> not sure what you mean
20:35 < day> i've never touched that setting and it's set to '2'
20:35 <@Dune> what if I'm not connected to a box
20:35 < koomi> day: distros might change it from the upstream kernel default
20:35 <@Dune> would the bug occur on localhost?
20:36 < koomi> not sure
20:37 < koomi> day: 2 doesn't even make a lot of sense, it's a boolean...
20:37 < koomi> day: let me guess, linux mint?
20:37 < day> arch
20:37 < koomi> oh hm
20:39 <@Dune> sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=0
20:39 <@Dune> but you meant on the router? I don't have shell access there
20:40 < koomi> no no, on the machine where the server is running
20:40 < koomi> the tw server
20:40 < koomi> it's not that then
