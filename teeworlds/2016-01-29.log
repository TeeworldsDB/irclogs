07:36 < Nibiru> test...
21:30 < WolfAlex> minus: ping
21:32 < WolfAlex> 5.164.94.197 hosting servers with 64/16 players
21:34 < WolfAlex> also 60 servers, causing the serverlist to load slower
21:35 < WolfAlex> all 'servers' point to the same gameserver
21:35 < Henningstone> just masterban 5.164.94.197 and you are fine, the servers are not spoofed
21:38 < Henningstone> or at least not spoofed with random addresses ^^
21:38 < WolfAlex> Henningstone: problem is that this is not visible in 'vanilla' client and tw does, as we all know, not support mods
21:39 < Henningstone> Oh lol you are true, I didn't think about it... Ok the it is already fine.
21:39 < WolfAlex> well:
21:39 < WolfAlex> <WolfAlex> 5.164.94.197 hosting servers with 64/16 players
21:39 < WolfAlex> <WolfAlex> also 60 servers, causing the serverlist to load slower
21:40 < WolfAlex> x) maybe.... hope
23:08 <@heinrich5991> num_chunks in the packet header is redundant, too
23:47 < rand> someone is spoofing ip to send message for twitch.tv/twneuronnetwork
23:47 < Henningstone> 0.7 pls
23:47 < rand> i remembered sby talking about a learning AI
23:47 < rand> Henningstone: yep, can't wait :)
23:47 < Henningstone> me? in the forum=?
23:47 < Henningstone> xD
23:48 < Henningstone> well that neuron networking thingy is nice indeed
23:48 < rand> someone who already implemented it ^^
23:48 < Henningstone> huh?
23:50 < rand> i meant, I saw a message, forum or ingame from this AI maker 
23:50 < rand> can't remember who
23:50 < Henningstone> aso
23:50 < rand> i wondered if it's xush
23:50 < Henningstone> xDD
23:50 < Henningstone> always xush's fault :
23:51 < rand> that's the punch line :)
23:51 < rand> I don't know why though
23:52 < Henningstone> just because...? or maybe øıŋĸ?
23:53 < rand> I really don't get xush's personality yet
23:53 < Henningstone> kinda offtopic I think :\
23:54 < rand> maybe
23:56 < rand> It might be Meskalin
23:56 < Henningstone> wow, why do you think so?? o_O
23:57 < rand> the player that spoke about learning AI
23:57 < rand> (not xush)
23:57 <@matricks> MOO!
23:57 < Henningstone> øıŋĸ øıŋĸ!!
23:58 <@matricks> PIG!
23:58 <@matricks> why are all fun things so expensive
23:58 < Henningstone> maybe because they are fun :\
23:58 < EastByte> coding isn't expensive
23:59 < Henningstone> ↑ +1
23:59 <@matricks> HOLY CRAP!
