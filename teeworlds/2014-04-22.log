11:42 <@minus> you should really fix that, Siile
11:57 < Siile> fix what?
11:58 < Siile> I think I fixed player count and related issues last night
11:59  * matricks burps sensually into minus ear
11:59 <@matricks> minus: did you watch revision?
12:02 <@minus> matricks: some of it, none of the compos though
12:02 <@matricks> okey
12:02 <@minus> matricks: gonna get some youtubes for them
12:02 <@matricks> I've heard that TBL rocked the amiga-demo atleast
12:03 <@minus> well, amiga demos rock the most anyway
12:03 <@matricks> AMIIIIIGAAAAAAA!
12:04 <@minus> i've seen the game compo
12:04 <@minus> the C64  game was nice
12:04 <@minus> esp. in terms of music
14:49 < Savander> Hey guys, i have problem.. Where i can found this class?:  CNetEvent_*. (eg. CNetEvent_HammerHit) I don't know where is it. Someone knows?
14:49 <@minus> Savander: it's probably generated by python code
14:49 <@matricks> those are generated from datasrc/
14:50 <@minus> gonna do some firmware upgrades on the network hardware here tomorrow
14:50 <@minus> what that basically means is that i flash the router with openWrt :D
14:51 <@matricks> Savander: the headers are under src/game/generated
14:51 <@matricks> but never edit those directly
14:52 <@minus> matricks: with my reworked bam.lua they'd be under build/generated :D
14:52 < BotoX> enjoy your brick minus (　≖‿≖)
14:52 <@matricks> minus: that is better :)
14:52 < Savander> but i want hints in eclipse :D, Thanks for answer :]
14:53 < BotoX> be sure to use trunk, new bootstrap UI is pretty cool
14:53 <@minus> BotoX: flashed 12.09 on the other one. works fine, looks nice
14:53 <@minus> Savander: then build it once and then add those files to the project
14:54 < BotoX> fucking double NAT https://i.botox.bz/1398171238.png
14:54 < BotoX> and no native v6, using HE's tunnelbreaker
14:55 <@minus> BotoX: avoiding double NAT here at all cost
14:55 <@minus> even if it means using the shitty old router/modem
14:55 < BotoX> I've been using an exploit to set my ISP's router to bridge
14:55 < BotoX> a few days ago my internet disappeared
14:55 < BotoX> and then it was back to NAT, exploit stopped working
14:56 <@minus> greetings from TR-069
14:56 < BotoX> TC7200
14:56 < BotoX> Thomson is literally hitler
14:57 <@minus> greetings from TR-069 anyway
15:01 <@minus> so
15:03 < BotoX> Maybe I should call my ISP and get a replacement
15:04 < BotoX> since I originally had a modem, it randomly died and I got this router
15:06 < Savander> I have these files ("nethash.cpp, protocol.h/cpp, server_data.h/cpp") , and CNetEvent still not working. Maybe i do something wrong?
15:06 < Savander> :/
15:07 <@minus> did you grep those? should be in there
15:08 <@minus> src/game/generated/protocol.h has those CNetEvents
15:16 < Savander> Oh yeah i have it! :D And i added path to "generated" folder,  now everything working ;]
15:18 < Savander> Thanks for help guys :D
16:04 < Siile> Anyone wanna join my Tee Defence session?
16:13 < nameless_tee40> hey ?
16:14 <@minus> hey !
16:15 < nameless_tee40> anyone can help me with a error ?
16:20 <@minus> no/maybe/yes/maybe
16:20 <@minus> if you ask nicely
16:20 <@minus> actually
16:20 <@minus> if you ask at all
16:23 < nameless_tee40> ya ok ^^ I have a error in Teeworlds src: src/base/vmath.h:84:59: error: 'clamp' was not declared in this scope, and no declarations were found by argument-dependent lookup at the point of instantiation [-fpermissive] someone can help pls ? <3
16:24 <@minus> good ol' ADL. never figured that quite out
16:25 <@minus> did you change something there?
16:27 < nameless_tee40> Its not my src its a src from a friend but the error is in vmath.h right ?
16:30 <@minus> yes, line 84 is using clamp which was not #included
16:30 <@minus> or defined previously. i don't know where that is defined
16:33 < nameless_tee40> mh
16:33 < nameless_tee40> so what to do ?
16:34 < nameless_tee40> Windows works fine, Linux error
16:35 <@minus> i don't have my crystal ball with me, can't help you like this
16:56 < BotoX> #include math.h
16:56 < BotoX> "" or <> dunno :D
16:57 <@minus> "" should be fine
16:57 <@minus> well, clamp surely is not in the stdlib
17:10 < Savander> i love it... storm
17:11 <@minus> thunderstorm clouds + sunshine here
17:12 <@minus> also, feierabend soon
