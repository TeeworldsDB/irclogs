07:15 < floreo> guest__: you are right it's totally different, though I think it's "better" cuz it doesn depends too much on the output date format therefore it works all the time
07:16 < floreo> guest__: I got it about the **match** {command} and the next thingy thanks to you last time
07:17 < floreo> guest__: my idea was to have always the same date format, cuz I use fail2ban to parse the log, and for certain MOD, the output of the date is the year on 2 digits, it fails ... :D
07:18 < floreo> guest__: instead of doing **match for vanilla** {convert vanilla} **match for MOD xx** {convert MOD xx}
07:20 < floreo> guest__: also, the next thingy is cool but you have to rewrite two times print; fflush which I find a bit "dirty", but you were right about the .*, didn't pay attention to it :p perhaps instead of matching it would be wiser to simply add the good output datetime all the time, thanks :)
07:21 < floreo> matricks: sorry if it was considered flooding or anything wrong, I suppose we considered this topic interesting :)
07:24 < floreo> cd /buffer 3
07:25 < floreo> lol sry about that
08:23 <@matricks> floreo: no no, it's okey, it was me who did something wrong, it looked like a code dump before
08:46 < floreo> matricks: :)
11:24 < guest__> floreo: Sure, it can be better to always add the date, depending of your need.
11:24 < guest__> floreo: Regarding code that can appear several times, dont forget that "awk" accepts functions.
11:24 < guest__> floreo: echo -e "1 2 3\n\n1\n1 2" | gawk 'function p() { printf "%d field(s): %s\n",NF,$0; fflush() } { p() }'
12:04 < floreo> guest__: thanks for sharing your knowledge, I happened to use awk, and damn, it's so powerful :)
12:19 < guest__> floreo: Kernighan (and others) did a nice job! ;)
12:39 < floreo> guest__: indeed, and it's really cool to always learn new stuff and improve :)

16:56 < Edible> thats just not realistic
16:57 < Edible> a light sabre is supposed TO CHOP YOU INTO PIECES
16:57 < Edible> 1 hit kill
16:57 < Edible> maybe with the ninja, but not replacing hammer
