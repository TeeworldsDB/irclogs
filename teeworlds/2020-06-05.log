18:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/blob/7abcf7b70668955e1ca6a837d8051dc1bb934b68/src/engine/shared/network_token.cpp#L10-L14 this is broken btw
19:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is there a commit in vanilla somewhere fixing that banned for stressing network issue?
19:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's annoying af
20:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet7/commit/26b2437764edb0c0b3d0b92306aa1834decd66e2
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i think its only the netlimit, but connlimit is also usefull
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> to have both is the best
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yea, looked at it again. Having both is a good replace for the old system
20:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 the stressing network ban is almost client side
20:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it relies on an honest client, you can simply patch it out if it annoys you
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I want it to trigger after lke 5 to 10 retries or so
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> like 10+ players get banned falsely on a daily basis because of that.
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> tha ks fokko, gotta look into it.
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thanks
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I'd just remove it @jxsl13
21:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._.
21:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what's the purpose then
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> prevent abuse
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @jxsl13 that commit is good
