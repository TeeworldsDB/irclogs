22:39 < ChillerDragon> yo latenight hax0rs who wants to explain tw protocol to a 5yo?
22:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> a normal question would be better
22:52 < ChillerDragon> i struggle making a screenshot xd
22:53 < ChillerDragon> i just wonder where i can see what kind of packet it is. I was using tcpdump -X and searched for numbers defined in the protocol.h enum that was generated
22:53 < ChillerDragon> that did not work out too well
22:54 < ChillerDragon> NETMSGTYPE_CL_SAY seems to 24 and i have a chat message dump but i cant find number 24
22:54 < ChillerDragon> well or 18 in hex encoding
22:55 < ChillerDragon> or is it a 4 byte int and then not displayed as 18?
22:55 < ChillerDragon> ah well that makes no sense idk
