15:41 < day> anyone an idea regarding my 'mouse stuck in upper left corner, while using anything but fullscreen.' issue?
15:55 < deen> day: might be your window manager instead?
15:55 < deen> inp_grab setting might help
15:56 < deen> or a client with sdl2 might have different mouse handling
16:00 < day> deen: i dont use one
16:01 < deen> no window manager?
16:01 < day> only i3
16:01 < deen> that's a window manager
16:01 < day> ah nvm :D
16:01 < day> i meant the other one
16:01 < day> :P
16:01 < deen> desktop environment
16:01 < day> DE
16:01 < day> yeah
16:01 <@minus> i've never had a problem like that on i3
16:03 < day> good to know. maybe its because my screensetup is messing up the 'cursor center' i have 2  1920x1080 but one of them is vertical, so the over all xrandr 'virtual screen' has lots of dead space above my gaming window
16:03 < day> basically the cursor is stuck in the upper left corner, but if i pull very hard to the lower right it twitches a bit
16:04 <@minus> hah, i don't even have teeworlds installed
16:06 < day> D:
16:07 < day> that should get you banned!
16:13 < day> deen: <3 inp_grap 1 totally seems to fix it
16:32 < deen> great
16:38 < day> what exactly does it do?
16:40 < deen> force the mouse in the middle of the window
16:41 < deen> or disable that, not sure
