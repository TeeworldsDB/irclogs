20:17 <@heinrich5991> so, who's coming to 33c3?
20:45 < Funni> ich nicht :(
21:17  * koomi 
21:17 < koomi> waiting in line to register my DECT right now
21:19 <@minus> i hope you firewalled your PC extra tight
21:22 <@heinrich5991> i.e. nothing listening except maybe ssh :)
21:22 <@minus> what would you need ssh for
21:23 <@minus> you could run a windows vm and count the (milli)seconds until it's pwned
21:23 < EastByte> there are dozens of windows pcs in the network
21:25 <@heinrich5991> you scanned it? :P
21:26 < EastByte> no, I just counted them while looking around
21:27 <@minus> send the ping of death :D
21:39 <@heinrich5991> EastByte: so you're there as well? :)
21:39 <@minus> you got DECT phones as well?
21:40 < EastByte> unfortunatly not :/ I was talking about my experience of the previous c3s
21:40 < EastByte> This time I'm the one to stay home and watch the streams :)
21:50 <@heinrich5991> minus: are you there?
21:50 <@minus> no
