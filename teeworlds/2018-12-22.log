06:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <BeaR> How about an RFC like process for gameplay changes? An own repository just for discussing these changes via PRs, where one has to â€œownâ€œ a RFC document when proposing new stuff. People can discuss aspects on a per line basis or on the whole proposal. Also having a clear changelog by merging accepted proposals into the repo helps.
09:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> Not good  @cinaera read about this one article what Firefox needs to change in its mode of communication
09:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <magnet> What's the goal? Give the illusion of open development? Game design can't remain coherent if we try to please everyone
09:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <magnet> If you're interested in taking part of gameplay development bear I'm sure you are welcome, but because of your past contributions and the fact that I know you actually played the game enough and to a level advanced enough to have a meaningful voice
09:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <magnet> I find that RFC driven development leads either to everyone pushing for their pet peeves and leaving with a mess or as a fake open development model to look open
09:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <magnet> Obviously it works for more technical projects that are less opinionated and were balance matters less than games.
