02:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <cat-master21> Just created my first PR at\: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/3144 you can see nightly builds at https://github.com/cat-master21/teeworlds/releases ðŸŽ‰
13:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> DDNet just implemented a vulcan backend which doubled my fps <.< might be worthy to implement
13:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> here is the PR if you are interested: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/4687
13:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Notice the nice graphs, the Y axis is in Frametimes in ms (!= FPS) meaning lower values = better
13:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I get over 3-4k fps with it
14:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> +1
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Will still not use it
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Opengl 3.3
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> best
14:05 < minus> did teeworlds have multiple backends before?
14:06 < minus> because you certainly can't replace opengl with vulkan, that'll not work on many systems
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't think teeworlds ever had?
14:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in ddnet before u could choose between opengl 1 and 3
14:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and 3.3
14:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> no, only ddnet has this feature, while teeworlds has at least wrapped it's functionality around the backend
14:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I think they got it running on windows, linux and mac (for all backends). If you can't you could still fallback to another setting
14:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> of course
14:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I still need to do that bugfix PR <.<
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> oof vulkan
