12:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> by implementing water you can find out the density of a tee and with some calculations actually find out how much Tees weight
12:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> i hope they arent like 1 metre wide.
13:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> good point, I am missing a reference frame for the size
13:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> Well, it also depends on the density of the water, doesn't it? It could be very salty water or clean water
13:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> tee is fat.
