22:34 < nobody1> when u look at the delay between a player aiming at a target and actually firing, it tends to cluster around increments of 20000 Âµs and i was told that this was because vanilla and ddnet clients send updates once every 40ms: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/213015051999772672/367396237978238986/Untitled.png - so does anyone know why a few players do not show this stairstep pattern? and whether i can use this data to detect
