09:00 < ChillerDragon> no @jxsl13 why would you
09:00 < ChillerDragon> you can just mod the server :) 
09:08 < ChillerDragon> yo wikipedia says teeworlds had like over 2 million players in 2016 any idea where that number comes from?
09:09 < ChillerDragon> oh ye it lists a source^^
09:10 < ChillerDragon> teeworlds-stats.info sad its down but i can remember it maxing out at 800k nicknames
09:10 < ChillerDragon> does teeworlds.com count downloads?
09:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there are some "small" benefits by doing stuff automatically vs by hand ;)
10:19 < ChillerDragon> wdym
10:19 < ChillerDragon> whats ur goal?
10:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> banning some vpns, for example
10:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> preventing funvoting
10:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and moderating from discord. I do have such a project already, but it is a monolithic structure, that is hard to extend. So I'm not taking a different approach :
10:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ðŸ™‚
10:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> github.com/Teeworlds-Server-Moderation/
10:56 < ChillerDragon> so u dont want to rewrite in c++ i guess yea that makes sense
10:56 < ChillerDragon> any issues with parsing ddrace logs? also mabye that belongs to #ddnet instead
10:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no, just wonrdered, if you did know anything about that, as you did do ddrace programming and vanilla log parsing ðŸ˜„
10:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe you did also do ddrace log parsing
11:20 < ChillerDragon> yea no not yet
22:07 < ChillerDragon> i think it used to be a bug that when binding something on german keyboard it swapped y and z int he ui or somewhere
22:08 < ChillerDragon> where and how did that get fixed?
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> maybe SDL2?
22:36 < ChillerDragon> nah ddnet also uses SDL2 i thought so too but they still have the bug
22:37 < ChillerDragon> well most likley it has todo something with SDL maybe a different SDL2 version im not sure about these things
22:37 < ChillerDragon> keyboard layouts so hard
22:38 < ChillerDragon> sucks to be german
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the french one is much more disruptive
22:40 < ChillerDragon> dvorak masterrace
22:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Klingon master race.
