00:00 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: where does it link to?
00:07 <+necropotame> https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/teeworlds/
00:25 <@heinrich5991> necropotame: do you know whether that installs the normal teeworlds version from the ubuntu repository or something different?
00:36 <+necropotame> Never tried, but I think we can trust the version number
00:37 <@heinrich5991> for debian and derivatives, this isn't always true
00:37 <@heinrich5991> they backport security fixes
01:07 <+necropotame> I will check tomorrow the exact version in the package
01:09 <+necropotame> http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/universe/t/teeworlds/teeworlds_0.6.2+dfsg-2/changelog
01:10 <+necropotame> The changelog was updated in 2014 for this package (Ubuntu 16.04)...
01:15 <+necropotame> I think such update could happen mainly if you ask for it. Sending request to get the package updated should be a part of your "release script". Or maybe open a launchpad repository could be an another and more flexible solution. I'm not saying that is simple ^^
01:19 <+rand> > https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/teeworlds/0.6.4+dfsg-1
01:22 <+rand> a warning on the front page maybe useful, about using outdated client
