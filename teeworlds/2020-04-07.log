11:08 < wavi> hmm, looks like the clan of the player isn't available via econ
11:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yep, clan, client version and maybe flag would be nice to have when the player joins.
12:04 < wavi> client version is available
12:04 < wavi> what do you mean by flag?
12:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> country flag
12:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> client version is available, I mean shown when a player joins the game, not via the status command.
12:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> client version available?
13:00 < bridge> [freenode] <richrd> yeah true, can't get client version mid game
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> having to constantly execute the status command when a player joins would spam the logfiles with garbage... would be nice to have some more info when a player joins, I opened an issue for that kinda problem, where I discuss in (more or less) a monologue this problem.
21:38 < wavi> interesting, I just got a "[5e8cd4cc][assert]: src/engine/shared/network_server.cpp(286): errornous client id"  on the server
21:39 < wavi> followed by segfault
21:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> yeah, the new asserts, is that compiled from the master branch?
21:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the hashed timestamp means it's 074 or lower
