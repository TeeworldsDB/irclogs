14:01 < Rampoina> hello! does anyone know of a mod that adds dynamic map elements to the game? something like moving platforms
17:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> such a mod is not compatible with the teeworlds base game, thus you would not be able to play on such a server with any current client
17:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it would require a custom client.
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there was something like that in 0.6 basically minecraft in teeworlds, not necessarily moving platforms, but dynamic map interactions
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think it was called Minetee
17:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i think gores does have some maps with moving objects, too
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yup
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the KoG servers (without custom client)
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> entities, I'd guess
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ?
18:44 < ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 the prediction is a mess and they get represented by animated quads
18:44 < ChillerDragon> I mean if you think about it moving blocks are not much different than the laser doors in ddrace
