19:02 < shahan> I'm a lil bit out-to-dated with teeworlds <- wasn't playing it about a half of year
19:02 < shahan> now i'd like to continue playing and doing smth with development
19:03 < shahan> so now I have a question: does anybody knows if there is any version of teeworlds that is COMPLETELY mirated to SDL 2.0?
19:04 < EastByte> shahan: you might ask tw dev related questions also in #ddnet
19:07 < shahan> @EastByte: thx, I'll try now
