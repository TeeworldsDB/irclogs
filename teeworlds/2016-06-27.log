03:07 < needs1> That's fun: I'm plotting elo score of Nameless tee and it is very uneven, sometime it goes up like crazy and sometime it goes down very fast.  When it goes up, it probably means that a good player is behind "Nameless tee".  From what I can see, "Nameless tee" has been faked at least 3 times by good players the past 3 days ^^
