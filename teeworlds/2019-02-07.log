02:58 < TeeSlayer> What do you guys think about assigning new players to a random team instead of TEAM_RED when there is an equal player count? Have there been any discussions on this in the past? Assuming that nobody leaves the game or switches the team, and there is a constant flow of new players, TEAM_RED will always have either one more player or the same amount of players throughout the whole game, which is kinda unfair.
03:00 < Edible> its already random
03:00 < TeeSlayer> Another option would be to assign the new player to the team with less points.
03:00 < Edible> you don't know when someone is going to join or when someone is going to leave
03:00 < Edible> thus random
03:01 < TeeSlayer> it still gives an edge to team red
03:01 < TeeSlayer> since they always get the new player first
03:01 < TeeSlayer> with equal player count
03:01 < TeeSlayer> that's where I'm getting at
03:02 < TeeSlayer> if it's a popular server, it's unlikely that people will leave before the game ends
03:03 < TeeSlayer> and still it doesn't matter
03:05 < Edible> you are right, an if team_players_red == team_players_blue && lastplayer { lastplayer--; newplayer is blue } { lastplayer++; newplayer is red} would be nice
03:06 < Edible> no clue how the code works, that's just an example
03:07 < Edible> TeeSlayer: it also depends on the scoring of each team, if all the good players are in blue, whats the point of randomizing?
03:07 < TeeSlayer> >Another option would be to assign the new player to the team with less points.
03:08 < TeeSlayer> then only randomize if both teams are equally good in terms of points :D
03:08 < TeeSlayer> It's just a minor detail which has bugged me for a long time
03:09 < Edible> the score doesn't really matter though, what matters is where are the good players
03:09 < TeeSlayer> it obviously can't fix balancing
03:10 < TeeSlayer> the score doesn't matter? you mean the team score?
03:10 < TeeSlayer> how else would we measure whether somebody is good?
03:10 < Edible> I do know ddnet has a frag ratio but don't know how they implement that, but with the frag ratio you can balance properly
03:11 < TeeSlayer> yeah that's not possible since only clients know of the k/d ;D
03:11 < Edible> next version maybe?
03:11 < Edible> well, if you're going to modify the server, might as well do it right
03:11 < TeeSlayer> true
03:33 < Edible> this has been discussed before, it never gets implemented, its also hard to do a balancing act, especially in the middle of a round, if anything, the balancing act needs to be made at the end of one
08:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> TeeSlayer: you can easily keep count of K/D server side, but it should be team score based or random
10:09 < Yasusi> are there anyone who can help me with compiling?
10:11 <@heinrich5991> ask the question :)
10:29 < Yasusi> so i want to compline a servert
10:30 < Yasusi> Chillerdragon's  mod
10:30 < Yasusi> and I need visual studio 8/9/10 I have 10,and also 2017 but it wont recognise it 
10:30 < Yasusi> and I can't do any compline 
10:30 < Yasusi> Becouse bam wont recognise the visual studio
10:35 < Yasusi> The specified configuration type is missing.  The tools for the configuration might not be installed. === building bam === 'cl' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. 'src\tools\txt2c' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. 'cl' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
10:40 < Learath2> it used to be that you either needed to use the visual studio command prompt or run vcvarsall.bat in a command prompt to get the PATH set up properly
10:40 <@Dune> https://teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything_windows
10:40 < Learath2> but it's been a while since I compiled with bam
10:41 <@Dune> you need to Run the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt (64Bit) from the start menu.
10:41 <@Dune> Bam does not recognise Visual Studio 2017
10:51 < Yasusi> Where can I get bam lua?
10:52 <@Dune> huh, it's in the teeworlds source
10:53 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/bam.lua
10:58 < Yasusi> I'm getting soooo much errors... :C
10:59 <@Dune> you could start by compiling teeworlds to see if it's teeworlds related or mod related
11:03 < Yasusi> [string "src/base.lua"]:440: other/curl/curl.lua not found bam: script error (-t for more detail)
11:03 < Yasusi> can't even build simple tw
11:07 <@Dune> there is no curl in teeworlds? I don't think you're building teeworlds
11:07 <@Dune> make a clean repo
12:21 <@heinrich5991> there's only curl ddnet
12:21 <@heinrich5991> just use cmake for ddnet ^^
12:24 <@Dune> he left
17:12 <@Dune> damn, a search for a github IRC webhook service yielded me teeworlds.com on the first page :D
17:19 < Oy> :P
17:27 <@Dune> shouldn't we link to https://github.com/matricks/bam/archive/master.zip instead of https://github.com/matricks/bam/releases/tag/v0.5.1 in the docs?
17:27 <@Dune> arch detection doesn't work well on bam 0.5.1
17:28 < Oy> yeah, sure
17:28 <@Dune> Also: Bam does not recognise Visual Studio 2017. As a workaround, to compile bam, copy `line 45 to end` from `make_win64_msvc.bat` and paste it in the `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt`
17:28 <@Dune> isn't that overly complicated?
17:28 <@Dune> might as well run it in the native tools command prompt
17:29 < Oy> or maybe to the latest commit, so future commits which might break the master branch won't be used
17:29 < Oy> yeah, just use the native command prompt
17:29 <@Dune> we can also link teeworlds/bam if we want to be safe
17:30 < Oy> you want to build tw after bam anyway
17:31 < Oy> the tw/bam needs to be up to date :D
17:33 <@Dune> it might be wisest to remove pull requests from https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds-translation
17:34 <@Dune> maybe https://github.com/teeworlds/bam too? PRs should be discussed upstream, they can always be pulled/merged downstream
17:34 < Oy> like i wrote, you can't disable them :(
17:35 < Oy> they might add such a feature in the future
17:38 <@Dune> oh?
17:38 <@Dune> missed that then
17:40 <@Dune> right
17:43 < Oy> not sure about making them all left aligned https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1986
17:43 < Oy> settings->controls would look odd
17:50 <@Dune> definitely
17:50 <@Dune> only inconsistency I see is filters vs search/addr bar
17:51 <@Dune> and some missing colons I guess
17:51 <@Dune> welp that's already fixed
17:51 < Edible> whats an IRC webhook service?
17:51 <@Dune> hopefully Transifex plays nice with the : in locales :/
17:52 <@Dune> I guess appending the ":" in the code is a bit dirty? :/
17:52 < Edible> "github IRC webhook service"
17:53 <@Dune> Edible: an IRC bot that listens to events such as github commits/issues/PR and shows messages for it
17:53 <@Dune> there was one here until the service was discontinued last month
17:53 <@Dune> but I think now we're supposed to run the bot ourselves
17:55 < Edible> ah, isn't that easy though?
17:56 <@Dune> there are a lot of easy things to do for Teeworlds, we lack people doing them :D
17:56 < Oy> yeah, appending the ":" later would be a bit odd
17:57 < Oy> yeah, search should be left aligned
17:57 <@Dune> Then that settles it
17:57 <@Dune> I would argue you don't even need colons in the Controls menus
17:58 <@Dune> You have a different background, that's enough
17:58 < Oy> what did u mean with filters?
17:58 <@Dune> the labels under the filters
17:59 <@Dune> they are left aligned vs center aligned Search
17:59 < Oy> ah
17:59 <@Dune> well this is all UX masturbation :D
17:59 < Oy> :D
18:00 <@Dune> oh, german, portuguese, scottish and russian 100% complete the last two days :)
18:01 < Oy> how about splitting the bottom  info text in the server browser "xxx servers, xxx player" into 2 lines? then we have more space for the labels on the left (host address, search)
18:01 < Oy> that'S good :)
18:02 <@Dune> it seems like those are transifex enthuasiasts that come to help with teeworlds, so it seems like transifex really brings something to the table here :)
18:03 <@Dune> Don't we have plenty enough of space there, Oy?

18:05 < Oy> yeah, you get a wider audience with transifex, that's good. i remember, had to bother friends for translations in the past :D
18:05 < Oy> Dune: dunno about translations
18:08 <@Dune> grep says longest Server address is `tr": "Chomlec'h an herberc'hier :"`
18:09 <@Dune> matching Servers is `Frithealaichean`

18:11 <@Dune> if something works in scottish, it'll work in everything, lol
18:14 < Oy> oO, that looks crazy, lots of overlaps
18:15 <@Dune> I contacted the guy to avoid using server(s) style grammar
18:16 <@Dune> hm, the use of ":" varies per language, so can't add it statically

18:37 <@Dune> more first-time hints sketches
18:39 <@Dune> I'm a bit unhappy about the lack of mousewheel
18:39 <@Dune> Need to add the forementioned notice
18:40 <@Dune> hints can be closed by clicking X (needs Esc). That's the best compromise I saw with a hotkey (since we recommend pressing Esc for something else than closing the hints)
18:44 < Oy> hm, it's odd to have some ui(clicking) ingame
18:44 <@Dune> could make it solid
18:44 <@Dune> :/
18:44 < Oy> pressing esc should be good enough
18:44 <@Dune> alright then
18:47 <@Dune> I could support A-Z, 0-9, Space, Mouse1, Mouse2 (Mouse3?), Esc for the binds, and ? for the rest
18:47 <@Dune> I'll need a proper mouse gfx though
19:00 < Oy> you want to make it dynamic, based on the actual binds?
19:00 <@Dune> it is
19:00 <@Dune> (almost)
19:00 < Oy> isn't it enought to make it fixed on the default binds?
19:00 <@Dune> could be, yes
19:01 <@Dune> I thought the system could be used for a later feature as an overlay, ingame or in demos. just some thoughts
19:01 < Oy> you just show that tip on first play right? doubt people modified their binds by then
19:02 <@Dune> yeah
19:03 <@Dune> just thought that kind of stuff could be reused for demos and such :)
19:04 <@Dune> but I guess there aren't many controls that aren't visible in fact
19:04 <@Dune> just left and right movement
19:04 <@Dune> and they shouldn't display the hotkey, so I'll stick with hardcoding I guess :)
19:35 < Yasusi> has someone got chillerdragon's entities?
20:10 <@Dune> best ask the maintainer directly when it comes to mods
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> oy, i think line 1-45 should get removed from bam make_win64_msvc.bat. It will abort with "You need Microsoft Visual Studio 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 15 installed" if you have visual studio 2017 or newer installed. Even if you run it in the VS Console
21:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> or search for vs2017 tools in the batch script but i dont think hardcoded paths are a good idea
