11:55 < TeeSlayer> > teeworlds.com: Teeworlds is a free online multiplayer game, available for all major operating systems. Battle with up to 16 players
11:55 < TeeSlayer> Now with up to 64 players! :)
13:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> 16 still
18:17 < TeeSlayer> @Sonix No? If you're talking about the default value, that is 8.
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Max players is 16 for vanilla
19:12 < TeeSlayer> It's not. I have vanilla servers with more than 16 players - additionally the description on teeworlds.com says "Battle with up to 16 players in a variety of game modes, including Team Deathmatch and Capture The Flag". "Variety of game modes" doesn't exclude non-vanilla modes.
19:18 < TeeSlayer> Okay, apparently the max value really is 16 for vanilla. Doesn't change the second part of my msg though.
20:16 < rand> 16 is the value for official (supported) gametype
20:21 < rand> in order to improve the message, opensource and its consequences can be left as a side note
22:06 < day> holy hell teeworlds on 60hz is literally unplayable
