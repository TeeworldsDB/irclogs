21:30 < seabass> Hello everyone
21:30 < ChillerDragon> hi seabass 
21:30 < seabass> I've a question :)
21:30 < ChillerDragon> shoot
21:30 < seabass> thanks :)
21:31 < seabass> Does anybody know if it's possible to run a server/connect to a server using TCP?
21:31 < seabass> I see lots of references to it in the code
21:31 < ChillerDragon> not possible as far as i know
21:31 < seabass> but nothing in the configuration files
21:31 < ChillerDragon> tcp is only for econ
21:31 < seabass> Ah, OK
21:31 < ChillerDragon> the remote console
21:31 < seabass> That's a shame for me
21:31 < seabass> my connection is pretty poor ATM :)
21:31 < ChillerDragon> tcp isnt faster xd
21:31 < seabass> Well it's actually :( but I'm trying to be positive
21:32 < seabass> TCP isn't faster, but I can see with Wireshark that there are really minor errors that just mess up the connection
21:32 < ChillerDragon> i thought tw also has a bit of errorcorrection not too sure tho
21:32 < seabass> TCP should have better error detection/recovery, and I think in my case it'd be worth the lag increase
21:36 < seabass> Oh well! I suppose it shan't be VanillaCTF today!
21:37 < seabass> I can't even spectate. It's that bad :(
21:38 < seabass> Still, it's good Wireshark practice. I'm into networking at the moment - out of neccessity I might add!
21:38 < seabass> Teeworlds is just the latest victim of a continually problematic glitch in my networking stack.
21:38 < seabass> I haven't pinned the problem down yet
22:01 < seabass> I noticed that heinrich5991 has made a Wireshark plugin for the Teeworlds protocol
22:01 < seabass> That should be a nice addition. And it's in Rust, which is even more interesting to me
22:02 < seabass> Keep up the good work, heinrich5991 :)
22:03 <@heinrich5991> thanks :)
22:04 < seabass> I think you did it in 2019?
22:04 < seabass> That should make it possible to compile without RustUp
22:04 <@heinrich5991> so far I only updated my plugin to wireshark 3.4
22:04 <@heinrich5991> I intend to complete it though :)
22:04 <@heinrich5991> let's see how that goes
22:04 < seabass> good luck :)
22:04 <@heinrich5991> I'm trying to keep compatibility with debian oldstable's rustc, so it should always be okay without rustup
22:05 < seabass> Oh, well I'm still running Wireshark 3.4.5, sooo...
22:05 < seabass> Is that a year out of date?
22:05 < seabass> I'm behind in my dist-upgrades
22:06 < ChillerDragon> what is the diff between a wireshark plugin and a dissector
22:06  * seabass downloads RustC
22:06 < ChillerDragon> ah its a dissector
22:07 < ChillerDragon> oh wow u updated yesterday heinrich5991 o.O how do i get it running? I guess the rust compiles into something that is c enough
22:07 < seabass> IIRC it goes straight into binaries
22:09 < ChillerDragon> i wonder why i never tried it probably i was scared of rust
22:11 < seabass> The New Rustacean Podcast is pretty good
22:15 < ChillerDragon> ill check it out
22:15 < seabass> https://newrustacean.com/feed.xml
22:15 < seabass> https://newrustacean.com/
22:16 < ChillerDragon> wait is it free?
22:17 < seabass> Yes, it is
22:17 < ChillerDragon> im confused by the site
22:18 < seabass> ChillerDragon https://newrustacean.com/show_notes/
22:18 < ChillerDragon> yo heinrich5991 i think i requested this already but what about a INSTALL.md or some usage instructions for libtw2? i could cargo build the dissector but i do not even find a binary
22:19 < ChillerDragon> ah seabass xd
22:19 < seabass> :)
22:19 < seabass> The show notes are generated with RustDoc itself :D
22:21 < ChillerDragon> yea i got that part while searching the actual podcast xd
22:21 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: the plugin isn't really useful yet, so there aren't install instrucitons
22:22 <@heinrich5991> compile it and put the .so into ~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins/3.4/epan/
22:25 < ChillerDragon> i do not find the binary tho
22:26 <@heinrich5991> find . -name '*.so'
22:26 < ChillerDragon> null
22:26 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1612473972.png
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> check parent dir as well
22:27 < ChillerDragon> ah didnt see target dir
22:27 < ChillerDragon> expected it to be in root like in tw
22:27 < ChillerDragon> oh well in tw its build dir too ok i got it nice
22:29 < seabass> OK so how do I build?
22:39 < ChillerDragon> cargo build
22:39 < ChillerDragon> in the directory
22:40 < seabass> thanks :)
22:45 <@heinrich5991> cargo build --release
22:45 <@heinrich5991> it's very much unfinished though, it doesn't decode game packages
22:45 <@heinrich5991> it's just the outest layer that it peels away rn
22:45 <@heinrich5991> outermost*
22:45 < seabass> Ah, OK. Well please do continue. It's really interesting to me
22:51 < seabass> OK... now what? :)
22:51  * seabass reloads Wireshark
23:00 <@heinrich5991> did you put it into the directory? are you on wireshark 3.4.x?
23:00 <@heinrich5991> then observe some tw traffic on port 8303
