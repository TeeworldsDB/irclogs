22:15 < PsychoGod> matricks, hi, can you told me some more info ? if i would make new game on teeworlds source, could it be closed source and with ingame items purchase ? ofcource with piggyback to teeworlds... would we pay something or would we have some other problems ?
22:27 < heinrich5991> look into the license for what is possible
22:27 < heinrich5991> it's not hard to understand
22:27 < heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/license.txt
22:36 < Inedible> its MIT/X11 licensed so you dont have to reread it
22:36 < Inedible> if you've actually read it before
22:36 < Inedible> If you actually understand the GPL license then you should probably be a lawyer
22:37 < Inedible> or sent to an insane asylum
22:37 < Inedible> but thats off topic
22:37 < heinrich5991> it's zlib actually IIRC
22:37 < Inedible> mm
22:37 < Inedible> damn you
22:37 < Inedible> now i'll actually have to read it
22:38 <@minus> i thought it was BSD
22:39 < heinrich5991> lol
22:39 < Inedible> its not BSD
22:39 < Inedible> its not MIT either
22:39 < heinrich5991> wiki says zlib
22:39 <@minus> it's zlib
22:39 < heinrich5991> (en.wikipedia)
22:39 < Inedible> yep
22:40 < Inedible> sorry for the error
22:40 < Inedible> what matters is its copyfree.
