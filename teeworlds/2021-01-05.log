01:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @TsFreddie that screenshot looks kinda fake, tees are soo evenly spread out. I'd expect more tees that are close together if it's a random screenshot. in fact, I don't think I even see two tees right next to each other
01:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> true it looks odd
01:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I thought it was some mod at first
01:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 thanks, downloaded
02:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> The mod don't allow you to pin two tees too closes
02:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Otherwise they just bunch up and fill the 64 tees limit too quick
02:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> So the spacing is artificially introduced
02:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> It is a mod. Don't really have a better way to organize a screenshot event given how many player we had this year.

02:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I just run the server for a week and let them choose their spots.

02:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> It is a bummer that the 0.7 compatibility layer didn't really work on this server, because I rushed out the mod in two days.
