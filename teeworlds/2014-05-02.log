00:17 < Racerman96> Hello :) I have a question...
00:20 < Racerman96> I speak german...My english is not so good. Sorry :/ +++ Okay my problem is: I set up a server on linux and if i start the server with "screen -S tw ./openfng/teeworlds_srv -f config.cfg", the server show me this error:  Cannot exec './openfng/teeworlds_srv': No such file or directory ....Help me please!
00:24 < ghost91> have you checked that the path „./openfng/teeworlds_srv“ is correct?
00:24 < ghost91> e.g. is there a folder called openfng in the current folder and is there a file called teeworlds_srv in that folder?
00:26 < ghost91> Racerman96: 
00:26 < Racerman96> Its correct! :) And this is my .sh file:  #/bin/bash cd /home/Racerman96/Teeworlds/ screen -S tw ./openfng/teeworlds_srv -f config.cfg
00:27 < ghost91> 1. it should say #!/bin/bash in the first line
00:27 < ghost91> with the !
00:28 < Racerman96> Oh okay x( I change it..wait a moment please.
00:30 < ghost91> and the file /home/Racerman96/Teeworlds/openfng/teeworlds_srv exists (and is executable)?
00:30 < Learath2> ghost91: btw i do compile teeworlds with mingw on windows
00:31 < ghost91> great, we need somebody to update the docs to contain that info
00:31 < ghost91> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=CompilingEverything
00:31 < Racerman96> How can I set that the file is executable?
00:32 < ghost91> ls -l /home/Racerman96/Teeworlds/openfng/teeworlds_srv
00:32 < Learath2> ghost91: its really just the same as msvc. You just compile bam within mingw shell and call bam from inside mingw shell
00:32 < ghost91> ah, ok
00:33 < Racerman96> The server show me:  -rwxr--r-- 1 Racerman96 Racerman96 1221856 May  1 23:50 /home/Racerman96/Teeworlds/openfng/teeworlds_srv
00:33 < Racerman96> i type first: chmod 744 ./twstart.sh
00:33 < ghost91> yeah, it is executabla
00:33 < ghost91> executable*
00:34 < ghost91> the x in „-rwxr—r—„ tells you, that it is executable for the owner of the file
00:34 < Racerman96> Okay...its good...Im the owner of the file ;)
00:35 < Racerman96> A forum tells me, i should type: chmod 755 ./twstart.sh    Why?
00:35 < ghost91> well, you can try screen -S tw openfng/teeworlds_srv -f config.cfg
00:35 < Racerman96> Okay wait please..
00:36 < ghost91> 744/755 does actually not matter at all, because you are the owner anyways
00:36 < ghost91> 755 means that others can execute it, too
00:36 < ghost91> other useres on the server
00:36 < ghost91> users*
00:37 < ghost91> (have you tried starting the server without screen?
00:37 < ghost91> )
00:37 < Racerman96> Hmm okay...Should i try it with 755? :) The server show me again: Cannot exec 'openfng/teeworlds_srv': No such file or directory    No...i try it..wait
00:40 < Racerman96> Okay i type: ./teeworlds_srv -f config.cfg and the server show me: -bash: ./teeworlds_srv: No such file or directory
00:40 < ghost91> Learath2: do you know if this is still correct with the latest version of msvc?
00:40 < ghost91> %comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"" x86
00:41 < ghost91> probably not, right?
00:41 < ghost91> meh…. i guess i need to install msvc after all....
00:42 < ghost91> is the mingw shell a bash?
00:44 < Racerman96> Do you mean me? :)
00:46 < ghost91> no
00:46 < ghost91> ;)
00:46 < ghost91> so, does starting the server without screen work?
00:47 < Racerman96> look up ;) at 00:40
00:47 < ghost91> ah
00:48 < ghost91> did you do this from within the directory /home/Racerman96/Teeworlds/openfng/ ?
00:50 < Racerman96> Yes :) I type: cd /home/Racerman96/Teeworlds/openfng/   and then   ./teeworlds_srv -f config.cfg
00:50 < ghost91> oO
00:51 < ghost91> are you still in that directory?
00:51 < Racerman96> I dont know what the problem is! :'((
00:51 < ghost91> can you give me the output of
00:51 < ghost91> ls
00:51 < ghost91> ?
00:51 < Racerman96> Yes :D
00:52 < Racerman96> ls:    bam.lua     configure.lua  license.txt  storage.cfg config.cfg  data           readme.txt   teeworlds_srv
00:52 < Racerman96> Wait..
00:53 < Racerman96> ~/Teeworlds/openfng$ ls     bam.lua  configure.lua  license.txt  storage.cfg  config.cfg  data  readme.txt  teeworlds_srv
00:54 < ghost91> what happens if you do
00:54 < ghost91> ./teeworlds_srv
00:54 < ghost91> ?
00:54 < ghost91> (have you compiled teeworlds yourself? i guess so..?)
00:54 < Racerman96> The server show me:   -bash: ./teeworlds_srv: No such file or directory
00:55 < ghost91> please type
00:55 < ghost91> file teeworlds_srv
00:56 < Racerman96> The server show me:   -bash: file: command not found
00:56 < ghost91> have you compiled openfng yourself?
00:57 < ghost91> i assume you are on a linux server, which distribution?
00:57 < ghost91> debian?
00:57 < Racerman96> yes Debian :) And i downloaded the server..
00:58 < ghost91> ah, ok
00:58 < ghost91> from where?
00:58 < ghost91> are you on 32bit or 64bit?
00:58 < ghost91> if you don’t know, just post the output of „uname -a“
01:00 < Racerman96> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=7868 The download link at "Linux 32bit server binary: *Link*"   I have: Linux vmd4821.contabo.net 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.2.54-2 x86_64 GNU/Linux
01:01 < ghost91> ok
01:02 < ghost91> and you downloaded it from github by clicking on „raw“?
01:02 < ghost91> and then renamed the file to teeworlds_srv?
01:03 < ghost91> or did you do something like „wget https://github.com/fisted/teeworlds/blob/openfng/openfng_srv_linux32d“ ?
01:04 < Racerman96> No i downloaded it to my local computer and upload it with filezilla...I try this: apt-get install ia32-libs   Tell me a forum now :D
01:04 < Racerman96> I install the 32bit librarys
01:04 < Racerman96> ^^
01:04 < fisted> openfng issue?
01:04 < ghost91> i don’t know, but i suggest you to compile it yourself
01:05 < fisted> yes, indeed.  i didn't update the binaries in ages
01:05 < fisted> also be sure to use the openfng_fixed_0_6 branch
01:05 < Racerman96> I try it...wait please a moment :)
01:05 < fisted> i crapped up the other one
01:05 < ghost91> i think that might be easier than figurign out what is wrong here...
01:05 < ghost91> Racerman96: you know how to compile it?
01:06 < ghost91> and how to get the branch openfng_fixed_0_6?
01:06 < fisted> this is the source you'd want: https://github.com/fisted/teeworlds/tree/openfng_fixed_0_6
01:08 < Racerman96> Yes :) I downloaded this *link* and rename the srv file :) and delete the folder without data :D that showed me a tutorial :)
01:08 < Racerman96> And i test it now with the 32bit librarys
01:08 < fisted> spoiler: most such tutorials are written by clueless idiots
01:09 < ghost91> :D
01:10 < ghost91> ok, well, so do you know how to compile it?
01:10 < ghost91> or not? :D
01:10 < Racerman96> no :(
01:10 < ghost91> ok, so first of all, download the sources
01:11 < ghost91> you can do this directly on your server by typing
01:11 < ghost91> wget https://github.com/fisted/teeworlds/archive/openfng_fixed_0_6.zip
01:11 < ghost91> oh, no sry
01:11 < ghost91> wget —no-check-certificate https://github.com/fisted/teeworlds/archive/openfng_fixed_0_6.zip
01:11 < ghost91> dann https…
01:11 < ghost91> damn*
01:12 < fisted> no git on the server?
01:12 < ghost91> don’t know, but this is easier now :D
01:13 < Racerman96> ok...i downloaded it...and now?
01:14 < ghost91> now you type 
01:14 < ghost91> unzip openfng_fixed_0_6.zip
01:15 < Racerman96> unzip int installed ._. How can i install it?
01:15 < ghost91> then you can remove the zip by doing „rm openfng_fixed_0_6.zip“
01:15 < Racerman96> isnt*
01:15 < fisted> speaking of easier... :)
01:15 < ghost91> ok
01:15 < ghost91> ...
01:16 < ghost91> go into a root shell
01:16 < ghost91> (type su and then enter the root password)
01:16 < Learath2> ghost91: mingw shell is bash ported over to windows basically
01:16 < ghost91> Learath2: ok, thanks
01:16 < Learath2> its actually msys which provides the bash 
01:17 < Learath2> mingw is the compiler kit
01:17 < Racerman96> yes yes Okay..and now? :D Basic knowledge of linux I have ;P
01:17 < ghost91> ah, ok
01:17 < ghost91> so you type
01:17 < ghost91> apt-get install unzip libsdl-dev
01:18 < fisted> there is no need for libsdl-dev
01:18 < ghost91> oh
01:18 < ghost91> right
01:18 < ghost91> sry
01:18 < ghost91> only the client needs it...
01:18 < ghost91> so remove that one :D
01:18 < ghost91> so
01:18 < ghost91> apt-get install unzip
01:18 < ghost91> this shoudl install unzip
01:19 < ghost91> sould*
01:19 < ghost91> should*
01:19 < ghost91> Learath2: so is msys stuff really needed or is it also possible to do this from cmd?
01:19 < ghost91> because i know it is possible to invoke the mingw stuff from cmd
01:20 < Racerman96> ok..and now unzip openfng_fixed_0_6.zip? :D
01:20 < ghost91> yes
01:20 < ghost91> :)
01:20 < Learath2> ghost91: should be able to call all the mingw set from cmd not sure how well bam configure will work tho
01:20 < ghost91> hm, ok
01:20 < ghost91> well i guess I’ll just have to try it out...
01:20 < Learath2> i can try it out for you
01:20 < ghost91> that would be great :)
01:21 < ghost91> Racerman96: when you are finnished unzipping, delete the zip by doing 
01:21 < Racerman96> the server show me now:   /home/Racerman96/Teeworlds/openfng# ls teeworlds-openfng_fixed_0_6   :D
01:22 < Racerman96> yes yes :D
01:22 < ghost91> ok
01:22 < ghost91> oh, i forgot, we need to install bam and probably g++, too
01:22 < ghost91> so go into a root shell again and do
01:22 < ghost91> apt-get install bam g++
01:22 < Learath2> ghost91: if you have mingw/bin in your path bam detects fine 
01:23 < ghost91> ok, great
01:23 < ghost91> thanks a lot :)
01:23 < Learath2> shouldnt conflict with msvc because unless vcvarsall is called cl isnt in path
01:23 < ghost91> ok
01:23 < ghost91> but if it is path, bam defaults to cl?
01:24 < Learath2> cant try that
01:24 < Learath2> msvc is 8 gb i dont have it on my computer
01:24 < ghost91> :D
01:24 < ghost91> wait, i should be able to figure that out myself
01:24 < ghost91> configure.lua should decide on that
01:24 < Learath2> yep
01:25 < Learath2> it should default on cl
01:25 < heinrich5991> minus: upgrade your browser
01:25 < heinrich5991> meh
01:25 < heinrich5991> you haven't even looked for restoring the addon bar?
01:25 < Learath2> btw ghost91 the vcvarsall path looks correct to me
01:26 < ghost91> yeah, but it says Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0
01:26 < ghost91> is 9.0 the most recent version?
01:26 < heinrich5991> I think 10 is the most recent version
01:27 < Learath2> i might be wrong on this one but i dont think vcvarsall moves
01:27 < Racerman96> ghost91: i installed bam and g++ now :D
01:27 < heinrich5991> 12 is the newest one
01:27 < heinrich5991> wow
01:27 < ghost91> I know that this moved in the past….
01:27 < ghost91> Racerman96: ok, great
01:28 < ghost91> now „cd /home/Racerman96/Teeworlds/openfng/teeworlds-openfng_fixed_0_6“
01:28 < Learath2> well you could get the location from the registery :D 
01:29 < ghost91> Learath2: I only need it for the docs
01:29 < ghost91> and I think the most recent one is ok for that
01:29 < Racerman96> Okay...i see the folder and files now :o :'D
01:29 < ghost91> now type 
01:29 < ghost91> bam server_release
01:29 < ghost91> and it should start compiling
01:30 < Racerman96> yes :oo :D He does much!! :D
01:30 < Racerman96> Okay done! :D
01:30 < ghost91> ok, great
01:31 < ghost91> now try
01:31 < ghost91> ./teeworlds_srv
01:31 < Racerman96> you mean: openfng_srv_linux32d
01:31 < Racerman96> D:
01:31 < Racerman96> :D
01:32 < ghost91> na…
01:32 < Learath2> ghost91: checked with another friend the vc version should be 12.0 
01:32 < Racerman96> No? :o
01:32 < ghost91> oh, wwait a second
01:32 < ghost91> fisted
01:32 < ghost91> ?
01:32 < fisted> ii think the resulting binary is called openfng_srv
01:33 < fisted> that _linux32d sounds like that the shipped binary
01:33 < fisted> -that
01:33 < Racerman96> Ahh it worls *.*
01:33 < Racerman96> works*
01:33 < fisted> what did you run?
01:33 < Racerman96> Sorry xD ... i run openfng_srv! :D
01:33 < fisted> great
01:33 < ghost91> yeah, that’s the right one
01:34 < Learath2> well to many emoticons for me 
01:34 < fisted> see openfng.cfg for a reference configuration
01:34 < Learath2> gn8 y
01:34 < ghost91> cya Learath2 
01:34 < fisted> Learath2: :DD ^^ y u so unfunny? :P
01:34 < fisted> nite
01:34 < Learath2> fisted: ^^
01:35 < Racerman96> Thanks all for you support :D Bye :* xD gn8 all ^^
01:35 < ghost91> no problem ;)
01:35 < Learath2> i think he does it on purpose ...
01:35 < ghost91> might be true…
01:36 < Learath2> even i dont use that many emoticons
01:36 < Learath2> anyways
01:36 < Learath2> gn8 still :)
01:36 < fisted> he's german
01:36 < ghost91> yep, I’ll go, too
01:36 < ghost91> fisted: so am i
01:37 < fisted> and so am I
01:37 < ghost91> pff :P
01:37 < fisted> my observation is just that german kids tend to use a lot of emoticons
01:37 < ghost91> well, anyways, good night…
01:37 < fisted> good nite
01:37 < fisted> oh and
01:38 < fisted> your unicodes suck :)
01:38 < fisted> mh, too late i guess
07:44 <@minus> heinrich5991: yes, i haven't looked for restoring the addon bar aside from builtin stuff. why repair something that was not broken to begin with
10:26 < BotoX> ^
10:27 < BotoX> 28 last good firefox version, rip in piece FF :(
10:27 < BotoX> May the hate create a better browser
10:27 <@minus> :D
10:27 < BotoX> the new UI is fucking terrible for people with autism
11:53 < Siile> posted this here yesterday but here it is again

11:53 < Nimda3> [YouTube] Title: Teeworlds Client | Rating: 0.00/5.00 | Views: 18
11:54 < Siile> Anyone notice any difference in camera moving, eyes, recoil or tee's feet?
12:04 < heinrich5991> Siile: the feet are a little off
12:05 < heinrich5991> I didn't see it when I first viewed it
12:05 < heinrich5991> though
12:05 < heinrich5991> what I saw was the line from tee to cursor and the death animation that was there for a little bit longer than normal
12:14 < Siile> looks a lot better in game, the screen cap program made it lag like hell
12:16 < Siile> Added little delay to camera, weapon and eye movement, reworked the recoil and added bounciness to feet when jumping / moving fast
12:16 < Siile> now it actually looks like the tee isn't just a static object in the middle of the screen
12:36 < heinrich5991> mh. I wonder how that feels like
12:36 < heinrich5991> offtopic: http://nullus-ordo.rhcloud.com/aterchart-web/content/cleanhtml/css/tictactoe.html – tictactoe in the browser – without javascript
15:36 < heinrich5991> minus: oh, you tried builtin stuff?
15:36 < heinrich5991> kk
15:36 <@minus> ?
15:36 <@minus> yeah
15:38 < heinrich5991> might be pentadactyl
15:38 < heinrich5991> but for me it worked with builtin stuff
15:38 <@minus> how
15:39 < heinrich5991> right click on the UI somewhere
15:39 < heinrich5991> (not in the tab area)
15:39 < heinrich5991> -> addon-bar
15:39 < heinrich5991> then you can rightclick again
15:39 < heinrich5991> -> customize
15:39 <@minus> i'm pretty sure that was not there
15:40 < heinrich5991> mh
15:40 < heinrich5991> for me it's there
17:52 < goo> Hi all! in votelist, how can i make empty lines?
18:00 < Dunedune> goo: hi
18:00 < Dunedune> try with ""
18:05 < heinrich5991> goo: for some reason it was made hard to make empty lines and lines that do not do anything
18:07 < heinrich5991> you can try 
18:07 < heinrich5991> add_vote " " "echo  "
18:08 < heinrich5991> add_vote "\ua0" "echo \ua0"
18:08 < heinrich5991> where \ua0 is a no-break space
18:15 < goo> thanks
18:24 < heinrich5991> goo: did it work?
19:20 < goo> heinrich5991:kinda worked
19:21 < heinrich5991> goo: 'kinda'?
19:23 < goo> it adds only one
19:24 < goo> if i use add_vote " " echo " ". but with \ua0 it isnt empy, it puts \ua0
19:24 < goo> its windows based server
19:26 < heinrich5991> goo: the vote options must be distinct
19:26 < heinrich5991> so you can just use multiple spaces for further empty lines
19:27 < goo> yes, i am trying it like that now, does it check that vote name and vote setting are distinct, or only vote name?
19:32 < heinrich5991> vote name only I think
19:32 < heinrich5991> yea
19:32 < heinrich5991> only the name
21:46 < BotoX> https://github.com/search?q=exec%28%24_GET&ref=cmdform&type=Code
21:46 < BotoX> LOL.
