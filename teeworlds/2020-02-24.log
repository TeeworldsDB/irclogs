15:53 < rand> heinrich5991: how does removing weak hook change network code ? It may change the gameplay though
15:57 < rand> (thx for the review)
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it changes how the client predicts the hook, so re-implementing it for ddrace only ma be ugly especially with high ping
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> the client cannot correctly predict weak and strong hook anyway. the order of the characters is different for server and client
17:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> WTF is grep.app?!
17:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> A tool to search github? 0.0
17:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Thatâ€™s epic
