13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> ```after reordering some includes i get this error and i am not sure what could cause it
14:16 < minus> ChillerDragon: that generates implementations for those templates with the given types. you either need to do that for a few known types (and then can only use the template for those types; calling those functions with other types will compile but throw a linker error), or have the template function's body in the header.
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> ok i somewhat understood that but still have no idea how to fix the error .\_. i just run clang-forma
17:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> chillerdragon: it's just include reordering? try to isolate which include order change causes it
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (includes are very much not commutative in C and C++, remember that they just include all the text from that file at the location of the #include)
21:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> i think thats all breaking changes clang-format does
21:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> its a bit tidous to bisect since linux works i dont have any windows and my mac does not build so i have to push pieces of the big clang format diff to the slow github ci
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> well, you could try doing everything except the include reorder
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if you think that's at fault
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so you know whether your theory is true
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> right good idea
