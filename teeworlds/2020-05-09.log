20:14 < wavi> I'm making a web gui for Teeworlds, what do you think?  https://lounge.bittemple.org/uploads/75e1e24576e897fa/image.png 
20:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> looks good ðŸ™‚
20:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> how do you interface with the server?
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Econ prolly
20:26 < wavi> yeah econ
20:27 < gerdoe> hm how it works?
20:28 < gerdoe> that web gui will be only for hostings?
20:29 < gerdoe> or it works as api
20:30 < gerdoe> *im stupid sorry* then dont answer me
20:30 < gerdoe> i understood all
20:31 < wavi> it's a node.js app that connects to a teeworlds server via econ. it monitors game state and forwards game events to the web browser.
20:32 < wavi> I have the node <-> econ part of it on github already but the gui part isn't published yet
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> doing this econ based is really prone to breaking as the log format isn't really stable :/
22:56 < wavi> yea i noticed :P
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> but it looks great, gj
23:09 < wavi> thx!
