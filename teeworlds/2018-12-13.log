00:20 < Learath2> 64 players is kinda misleading, no? :)
00:32 < Dune_linux> how so, Learath2 
00:33 < Learath2> unless you changed it up while I wasn't looking isn't it 64 clients strictly limited to 16 players?
00:33 <@Dune> it's not, mods can go up to 64 players!
00:33 <@Dune> we changed it while you had your back turned ;)
00:33 < Learath2> oh, you did the work for the scoreboard? :)
00:35 <@Dune> it's ongoing, for now the scoreboard is just a hotfix
00:39 <@Dune> the protocol is there though :)
13:31 < homeless_tee> Hello
13:31 < homeless_tee> hi
13:31 < Dune> hey
13:32 < homeless_tee> whats up?
13:33 < Dune> preparing 0.8 for 2026
13:33 < homeless_tee> :DD
13:34 < homeless_tee> I think more players will playing with the older version, than the 0.7 :/
13:34 < Dune> we adjust the release schedule with the life expectancy of Oy
13:34 < Dune> it's always been like that. weren't you around with 0.5 and 0.6?
13:35 < homeless_tee> no, i start playing an 0.5 but i think 0.6 is the best :D
13:37 < homeless_tee>  I think the 0.7 will not be so successful, because just few players will update the client
13:40 < homeless_tee> so, I think the 0.7 will not be so successful, because just few players will update the client
13:41 < Dune> we will see. 0.6 took long for people to switch, 0.7 will take even longer
13:41 < homeless_tee> sure
13:42 < homeless_tee> i asked the ddnet, and they said they will not update
13:47 < minus> >Teeworlds and Softonic.com partnership
13:48 < Dune> haha, I got that mail too minus 
13:48 < minus> to what email address?
13:48 < minus> this one went to info@teeworlds.com
13:48 < Dune> info@teeworlds.com
13:49 < Dune> ah, duplicate
13:49 < minus> you get that too?
13:49 < Dune> yeah
13:49 < Dune> weren't you the one to subscribe me?
13:49 < minus> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
13:49 < minus> that was more than 2 weeks ago
13:51 < Dune> I read somewhere that fish memory lasts 12 days on average
13:52 < Dune> homeless_tee: people do what they want. if anyone wants to port it, then it is ported
13:52 < day> homeless_tee: thats good news. hopefully 0.7 wont be ddnet infested
13:54 < day> now nerf nade launcher and make pistole reload while in stash
14:00 < homeless_tee> day: thats true :D
14:01 < homeless_tee> @Dune i know but if too few players will playing, nobody wants to play alone :/ 
14:01 < day> homeless_tee: everyone knows, except the stupid devs :p
14:02 < homeless_tee> day, which version do you play?:P
14:03 < day> havent played in a while
14:03 < homeless_tee> ohh
14:04 < day> im waiting for the changes :P
14:04 < homeless_tee> :DD
14:04 < day> striking :P
14:04 < homeless_tee> i see 
14:05 < day> nah there was a cursor bug, which forced me to change settings within tw. which then caused that i couldnt tab out of the game. 
14:05 < homeless_tee> thats well .D
14:28 < Dune> I like how there's a thread somewhere of new weapons suggestions, and someone suggests a rocket launcher
15:13 < day> i think the sword needs a buff
15:14 < day> it is quite annoying that you stop after the dash
15:14 < Dune> you don't anymore?
15:15 < day> eh? nice
15:15 < day> was that changed in 0.7?
15:15 < Dune> no, that was long ago
15:15 < day> urg then it is still there.
15:15 < day> maybe it was even worse before?
15:15 < day> im sword main, i know :P
15:16 < day> you dont stop completely, but your speed is reset to idk. walking speed?
15:16 < day> the speed should reset to initial velocity prior to the strike imho.
15:17 < Dune> you should play again :P
15:19 < day> i will, but all my sword experience was in 0.6 so, unless you changed it in recent month it is still how i remember it
15:21 < day> if you move via hooking/swinging in one direction, then sword dashing will ultimately slow you down
20:24 < Oy> hey
20:27 <@Dune> hey oy
20:31 < Oy> everything seems to be alright, that's good :)
20:31 <@Dune> yeah, no major bug :) RC helps
20:33 < Oy> great
20:37 <@Dune> I was thinking about linux packaging repos
20:37 <@Dune> teeworlds doesn't have a launchpad, right
20:37 <@Dune> should it?
20:45 < Oy> don't think it's needed
20:45 < Oy> we have github
20:48 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed pull request #1855: Adjust volume label size (master...adjust-volume) https://git.io/fpdMe
20:49 <@Dune> I think launchpads can be used to notify maintainers there is a new stable release
20:49 <@Dune> but I don't know that stuff well :)
20:56 <@Dune> not a lot of issues in the 0.7.2 milestone, we can release next week :D
20:56 < Oy> in eleven days :P
20:57 < Oy> have some time next week to do some stuff \o/
20:58 <@Dune> now have some time to do some non-teeworlds stuff \o/
20:58 <@Dune> :P
20:59 < Oy> :D
21:05 < Oy> we should have a gathering and discuss the future - make a roadmap
21:05 <@Dune> in france or germany? :P
21:06 <@Dune> seriously, I think that is a good idea
21:06 <@Dune> what channel to use?
21:07 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1529 is done btw
21:07 < Oy> best would be on irc
21:08 <@Dune> that's probably the easiest for everyone too
21:08 < Oy> it's usually hard to get everyone online at a specific time
21:08 < Oy> but we should try
21:08 <@Dune> yeah
21:08 <@Dune> should I make a poll?
21:08 <@Dune> or we don't have everyone relevant in teeworlds.com?
21:10 < Oy> maybe a thread where we can discuss a time
21:10 < Oy> i remember for 0.7 it took a while :)
21:10 <@Dune> oh :)
21:10 <@Dune> around next weekend?
21:11 < Oy> yeah would be fine by me
21:11 <@Dune> I think everyone is on the forums already
21:11 <@Dune> teetow might be interested too (?)
21:12 <@Dune> he's our remaining guru after all
21:12 < Oy> sure. dunno if he's online much
21:30 <@Dune> are people usually more or less busy during christmas holidays?
21:36 < Oy> dunno. probably depends
21:48 < rand> Dune: about the issue with the scoreboard in serverview
21:49 < rand> we forgot about that
21:49 <@Dune> not sure what you're talking about
21:50 < rand> highlights everywhere
21:50 < rand> the color is not reset properly after a match with browser filter search
21:53 < rand> is it possible to get the previous TextColor() ?
21:54 < Oy> no function for it yet
22:06 <@Dune> I forgot about that bug, rand, sorry
22:07 < rand> so did I
22:08 < Oy> u should open an issue next time :P
22:08 < rand> we should have open an issue
22:08 < rand> shame
22:09 < Oy> well there is always a next version
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> I really would like to take part in that roadmap planning meeting.
22:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> And yes, that was sort of a test message for the discord-irc-bridge.
22:11 < rand> erf, french locale for "server address" does not fit with the sidebar
22:12 <@Dune> Ralbol: err
22:12 <@Dune> can be easily abbreviated right
22:12 < rand> et "Play" becomes "Lire" (like play a music)
22:12 <@Dune> ah
22:12 <@Dune> yes I need to put a context on Play
22:12 <@Dune> same problem in finnish, it's the demos' play
22:12 < Oy> there already is
22:13 < Oy> that was the reason i added the context
22:13 <@Dune> oh
22:13 <@Dune> didn't see
22:13 <@Dune> so it only has to be fixed on transifex now I guess
22:14 < Oy> think the demo one has the context
22:18 < rand> https://ptpb.pw/P6Ye.png 
22:19 <@Dune> huh
22:19 <@Dune> can you check if play has context on transifex rand?
22:20 < rand> if I need an account for this, I don't
22:24 < rand> i see 2 Play
22:24 < rand> on with menu_start context
22:25 < rand> and the other without context
22:25 < rand> if I understand correctly the UI of transiflex :]
23:29 <@Dune> oh, you don't need an account to see that, rand?
