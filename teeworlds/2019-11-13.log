13:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does somone love debugging linker errors ._.?
13:30 <@heinrich5991> what's the error?
13:32 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://pastebin.com/zfpH4Rb4
13:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> repo: https://github.com/jxsl13/lpc1768_blinky_example/tree/non_stl_abstraction
13:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> header: https://github.com/jxsl13/lpc1768_blinky_example/blob/non_stl_abstraction/include/hal/InterruptVectorTable.hpp
13:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> main: https://github.com/jxsl13/lpc1768_blinky_example/blob/non_stl_abstraction/src/main.cpp
13:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> implementation of the header: https://github.com/jxsl13/lpc1768_blinky_example/blob/non_stl_abstraction/src/target/STM32F407VG/InterruptVectorTable.cpp
13:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the target is the STM32F407VG
13:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the last commit broke it, the onesaying doesn't compile :/
13:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it seems to be about the instantiation of the singleton, which is a little bit weird, so it might be something in the constructor of InterruptVectorTable .
13:42 <@heinrich5991> have you verified that the commit before still builds (and there wasn't a change in your toolchain)?
13:44 <@heinrich5991> /away
13:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the previous commit compiles successfully.
13:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I get the same error, even when I delete all the implementation stuff.
19:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> fixed. rip my life :D. basically removing all destructor implementations of the static object
19:16 <@heinrich5991> ah
19:16 <@heinrich5991> that makes a bit of sense
21:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think it has something todo with static objects not needing to be destroyed in an embedded environment.
21:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but well, on another microcontroller this worked fine.
