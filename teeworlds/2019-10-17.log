01:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I really need help with the masterserver problem :/ Does anyone have an idea why it cant reach it? I just restarted my vps and then it registered itself, after 1 minute it said no master servers found again...
13:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rand: oh nice i got it running ‚ù§
13:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> are you planning to keep working on it? Is there a repo for this that i can sub?
13:18 < rand> yes, I create a repo on github, nheir/tw-dissector, I will update it this evening
13:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nice!
13:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> fstd: you got competition xd
13:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> on bitlab or gitbucket :troll:? cuz github is 404 https://github.com/nheir/tw-dissector
13:19 < fstd> neat
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> or is update equal to create?
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/nheir/tw-dissect
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nvm its only dissect
13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh rand btw the config dir didnt work :/ i had to put it here: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wireshark/plugins/2.6/epan
14:04 < rand> are you using linux ? or osx ? what about the wireshark version ?
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> wow, interesting... my server found the master, it all worked fine. Now I logged in to rcon and pretty much after that it said master isnt responding, and now it cant find any masters again.
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> What is this?!
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> How is this related? I noticed this some days ago already but thought it was random, but now it happens again
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It is strange to  me that this would be caused by a change in vanilla teeworlds. Surely it's mod-related?
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i dont know
15:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But I havent edited the mod in any way this would happen
15:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I dont know if this is even the cause, might also be something else
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but in general i didnt edit anything that should affect the matser registration
15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is there anything that could cause this if it gets changed? something like the netversion hash gets changed if you edit some specific files
16:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rand: Wireshark 2.6.8 (Git v2.6.8 packaged as 2.6.8-1.1)
16:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> debian10
16:48 < rand> ChillerDragon: you may try ~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins/
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea tried that didnt work either :/ i had to create that dir my self
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i dont even have a .local
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oooh wait or do i have to put it in /root/.local because i run wireshark as super user
16:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> probably
18:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is it a bug or a feature that there is no chat message anymore when spectators leave the game?
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It's a silent message, feature
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> You don't know when they enter either, often
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I modified the client I use to display them regardless
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nice job, @@Dune, wanted to ask for some frequently asked questions section somewhere where we can put such common issues.
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and you read my mind :0
20:55 < rand> Chillerdragon: all ~/.local... or ~/.config are bound to the user 
20:55 < rand> so using sudo -> /root I guess
20:55 < rand> I don't run it as root
20:55 < rand> I use tcpdump as root to get a capture, and then, I use wireshark as normal user
20:55 < rand> fail safe
