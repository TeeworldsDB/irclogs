11:19 <@heinrich5991> happy GDPR :)
11:19 < koomi> and happy towel day ;-)
11:28 <@minus> i even got GDPR spam by snail mail yesterday
12:23 < day> do all companies have to inform all of their contacts?
12:23 <@heinrich5991> companies have to inform people if they change their privacy policy
12:24 <@heinrich5991> if they have to change their privacy policy to comply with the GDPR, I think they have to inform you ^^
12:24 < day> but wasnt that always the case?
12:24 <@heinrich5991> not sure what you mean
12:25 < day> privacy policy change -> update clients
12:26 < day> ah nvm. the emails are merely a result of privacy changes due to gdpr. my bad
12:27 < day> i bet in 1 year noone even cares about gdpr anymore. its going to be ignored left and right
12:27 <@heinrich5991> hopefully not. they put fines in there to prevent that from happening
12:29 < day> afaik facebook is already in violation of it. lets see when they pay the "4% of their annual revenue" fine :P
13:49 <@heinrich5991> the goal is compliance, not fines primarily
13:49 <@heinrich5991> it'd be better to get them to compliance than to collect a fine
22:12 < jaard> Potato.

22:14 < jaard> Exactly.
