12:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Can we add a netmsg for changeinfo again? The limitation of not being able to rename tees ingame is rather annoying
12:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yes!
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no.
15:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Does people being creative with the feature somewhy offend you?
15:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Are you of the opinion, my way or the highway?
16:05 < ChillerDragon> there is the issue with backwards compatibility but imo it is worth breaking it for future good
23:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> For older clients the disconnect+connect workaround should be used. The only thing that would not be possible is changing your name on old servers.
23:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> But still... Why would you change the name of the local player? For other players the difference would just be 1 vs 2 (disconnect+connect) netmessages
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm against nicknames being changed during a session to prevent confusion and faking of other players or nicknames colliding with each other during a session. Anything else being changed during a session is fine, tho. In zCatch it's rather convinient, as stuff is being tracked during the time  aplayer is connected. I am not against the protocol supporting it, but I'm against it being the default behavior.
23:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 I think @Learath2 asked about the protocol, not the vanilla server
