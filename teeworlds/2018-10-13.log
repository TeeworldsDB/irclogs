12:28 <@heinrich5991> minus: if you care to make a 0.6.5 release, here's the source: https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/tree/fix-0.6, diff: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/compare/0.6...heinrich5991:fix-0.6
12:28 <@heinrich5991> can be compiled with cmake 2.8.9+, bam 0.4.0, bam 0.5.0
12:28 <@heinrich5991> fixes the issue players are currently seeing in the server browser (contains anti-IP spoof measurements for CONNECT packets)
12:29 <@heinrich5991> binary releases at https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/temp/
12:29 <@heinrich5991> (cross-)compiled with cmake from linux to linux 32bit, linux 64bit, win32, win64, macos
12:30 <@heinrich5991> tested everything while in progress, ultimately tested win32, linux 32bit, linux 64bit
12:30 <@heinrich5991> (don't have a mac to retest the binary there, but it should™ still work
12:30 <@heinrich5991> )
12:31 <@heinrich5991> if you do release this, I'll also write release notes after the release if you want
12:31 <@heinrich5991> didn't fix all warnings because I didn't want to put more work into something that might just be rejected
14:50 < minus> heinrich5991: i don't particularly care; i can up the files though
18:56 <@heinrich5991> minus: would be nice if you could upload it — I'd update the steam client when that happens :)
19:07 < minus> can you quickly tar them all up, heinrich5991?
19:08 <@heinrich5991> https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/temp/teeworlds-0.6.5-tarbomb.tar
19:08 <@heinrich5991> contains all the tars on the top level
19:08 <@heinrich5991> and the zip and the dmg
19:09 < minus> heinrich5991: uploaded
19:10 <@heinrich5991> thanks
19:10 <@heinrich5991> I might need your help once I write the new "downloads" post to update the link on the front page
19:13 <@heinrich5991> minus: hmmm. uploaded where?
19:14 < minus> https://downloads.teeworlds.com/
19:14 < minus> oh, you mean github?
19:14 <@heinrich5991> ah, thanks
19:14 <@heinrich5991> no, that's fine
19:14 < minus> afk
19:32 <@heinrich5991> minus: you could update the front page now
20:49 <@heinrich5991> it seems that there are some problems with this release :(
20:52 < Dune> namely?
20:52 < Dune> ah, just saw
20:53 <@heinrich5991> some people report that they cannot start it on windows 7
20:53 < Dune> well, I can :/
20:54 < Dune> oops, Avira said teeworlds_srv.exe has a "Hijacker" trojan
20:55 <@heinrich5991> …
20:55 < Sonix-> lol
20:57 < Dune> https://www.avira.com/en/support-threats-summary-product?tid=3649&threat=TR%252FHijacker.Gen&track=1
21:01 < minus> heinrich5991: you have a shell account on the website server too btw
21:02 < minus> i'll just give you su access
21:02 <@heinrich5991> oh, and the rights to change stuff there?
21:02 <@heinrich5991> thanks
21:02 < minus> already changed it though
21:03 < minus> hm, hopelessly outdated kernel
21:03 < minus> oh hei
21:03 < minus> downloads link to github
21:03 < minus> not downloads.teeworlds.com
21:04 <@heinrich5991> hm?
21:05 < minus> the download link on the start page
21:05 < minus> 0.6.4 also links to github already
21:06 < minus> how will you fix it, heinrich5991
21:06 <@heinrich5991> the release?
21:06 <@heinrich5991> or the download links?
21:06 < minus> the download link
21:07 <@heinrich5991> probably by linking back to downloads.teeworlds.com
21:07 < minus> that's in news.php
21:07 < minus> (almost muscle-memory'd a .py there)
21:19 <@heinrich5991> now, for the fine art of release quick fixes
21:20 <@heinrich5991> minus: can you update the releases on https://downloads.teeworlds.com/ with https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/temp/teeworlds-0.6.5-win32.zip
21:20 <@heinrich5991> (news.php is fixed already :) )
21:22 < minus> heinrich5991: just the win32 release?
21:23 <@heinrich5991> no, win32, win64 and the changed source
21:23 <@heinrich5991> (that only changes something in a #if defined(CONF_FAMILY_WINDOWS))
21:23 < minus> i'm just migrating downloads to the main server
21:24 < minus> /var/www/teeworlds.com/downloads, put them there
21:31 < Dune> makes me think heinrich5991 should probably get the dev medal on the forums
21:35 < Dune> https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/teeworlds/
21:36 < Dune> should this be flagged out of date? fill up security issues too
21:36 < Dune> idk archlinux
21:38 < minus> and of course i can't get a new cert for downloads.teeworlds.com because certbot on debian stable is so old it still uses a now-disable verification method
21:39 <@heinrich5991> :D
21:48 < minus> hey Kottizen you there
21:51 < minus> well, kinda fixed it
21:53 < minus> downloads.teeworlds.com now gets https from cloudflare, goes to downloads.teeworlds.com, gets an invalid cert (only valid for (www.)teeworlds.com), but continues, nginx interprets the request on the  www.teeworlds.com server block, which rewrites ^/teeworlds- to downloads/
21:54 < minus> if Kottizen was there i'd ask him to snapshot the machine, then upgrade to buster, which has a recent enough certbot to get a new cert for downloads.teeworlds.com
21:57 < minus> feel free to fix it properly, heinrich5991
21:57 <@heinrich5991> what does teeworlds.com currently host? forum and website, no masters?
21:57 <@heinrich5991> + downloads now
22:02 < minus> correct
