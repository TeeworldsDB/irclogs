03:07 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> quiet... too quiet.  so few players.  is it me?
10:37 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> most of the people hang out on quakenet or discord
10:37 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> there's a bridge though, so you see their messages here
10:37 <@heinrich5991> like this
10:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> or this
10:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Is he talking about discord, quakenet or teeworlds in general
10:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> idk
17:12 < minus> i don't understand why anyone wants to use discord, it's an awful chat client
17:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> How so?
17:45 <@Dune> for non-geeks: it's a lot more user friendly, no more / commands to learn
17:46 <@Dune> for others, it's also more feature-rich.
17:47 <@Dune> I think that outweighs the inconveniences of the javascript junk
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Most people dont care about the things we care about and when discord has a monopoly on the market avoiding it just doesnt change anything
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I only used facebook, because a lot of people (from rl) used it, I only used skype because a lot of internet friends used it, now I use discord, i see a pattern
19:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it's just the ever recurring pattern
19:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜‰
22:34 < minus> my UX beef with discord is that it shoves a whole truckload of shit in your face. i.e. if you join a "server" you're forced to join all those channels you may not even want
