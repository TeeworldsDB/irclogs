09:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Hardest to understand is probably the stuff in network.cpp. One of the few times I had to pull out a pen and paper to keep track of the packet flow
09:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Sdl stuff you can usually grasp, if you know sdl to start with
12:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Blade> I agree with jxsl, if stuff were commented, it'd way easier tu understand whats going on.
13:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Commenting is harder
19:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Any thought on this? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2788
21:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Well I wouldn't call the ddnet tile system easy to extend ðŸ˜… 
21:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> It's just hard coding additional layers with a specific functionality
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Allowing multiple game layers that can have additional parameters per tile (like teleport number) would be a start. Mods could use some identifier (uuid?) to actually use these parameters.
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> That would at least reduce the required code but you still need a custom client to modify the maps and ofc a server that can make use of the parameters
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i just mean extensible tiles
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> just for game layer for start
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thats better in ddnet than in vanilla
21:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> well okay... one could restructure the collision code a bit yeah
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Do you have any good ideas for that?
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Ah well, you said you dont have so much time yesterday :D
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> didn't look at that code for quite some time =\
21:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i am working on a """kinda api""" (not really an API, just code exporting xd) for teeworlds modding, so merging with master works better and the whole source doesnt get bloated. For this, i of course also want tiles to be extensible in an easy way
21:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> My work for now
