08:24 < nameless_tee30> Out of curiosity, was that one of you guys that logged into Broken's account? Is it breaking any rules to ask that or can you not give that information?
08:26 < nameless_tee30> Is anyone even awake? lol
08:29 < nameless_tee30> I hope Broken's trolling.
15:05 < boddah> is there something like a wait command (for a .cfg file)?
15:06 <@matricks> no
15:06 < boddah> k, thanks
15:06 <@matricks> what are you trying todo?
15:08 < boddah> i want to change the tuning by passing a vote, but i have to do it twice everytime because of the resetting, while the serv is still "pure"
15:09 < boddah> well, i guess it's because of the resetting
15:09 <@matricks> oh.. so you wanna turn off pure and then set the tuning
15:09 <@matricks> ?
15:10 < boddah> yes
15:10 <@matricks> why not just run it as unpure always?
15:10 < boddah> because unpure is always dm (when my information is right(?) :D)
15:11 <@matricks> unpure is always MOD
15:12 <@matricks> it's no game mode more or less
15:13 < boddah> yeah.. but it's basically dm i guess 
15:13 <@matricks> yeah, without any goals
15:14 < boddah> that means? no scorelimit/end of the round?
15:14 <@matricks> scorelimit still works
15:14 <@matricks> score and timelimit works yeah
15:15 <@matricks> btw, changing game mode on a server while running is a bit, iffy
15:15 < boddah> why?
15:16 <@matricks> evil to change server type when people join to play one thing and end up playing another
15:17 < boddah> ah ok. but it's just for a LAN server, with votes to change the settings, so it's easy for everyone
15:17 <@matricks> ahh
15:19 < boddah> k, guess i have to live with it, and vote twice, when i want to play "tuned", thanks anyway
15:19 <@matricks> tuned == official :)
15:19 < boddah> ok
15:20 <@matricks> all those checks are there to help ensure that when people pick a server with DM/CTF/TDM, they are going to get the experience that we built teeworlds for
15:20 <@matricks> thats why you can't change tuning while you are in those game modes
15:21 <@matricks> and also the reason why modded servers are not allowed to call themself DM/TDM/CTF
15:22 < boddah> yeah, that's good, the game is pretty well tuned, no question, but sometimes you want to do some weird stuff on LAN, like one-shot laser or something, funny :D
15:22 <@matricks> yeah, sure :)
15:23 < boddah> btw, what was gun_lifetime for? now it's not longer known?
15:23 <@matricks> I think it's the lifetime for a gun bullet
15:24 < CookieMichal> There are gamemodes c|DM and c|CTF :)
15:24 < CookieMichal> I am currently hosting one
15:25 < boddah> but it's not working anymore(?) i found it on the website, are the commands from an older version maybe?
15:25 <@matricks> don't think it's used anymore :/
15:27 <@matricks> oh it is
15:27 <@matricks> it's the time for how long time a gun bullet lives
15:27 <@matricks> 2 seconds are usually much more then needed
15:27 <@matricks> it hits the will much earlier
15:30 < boddah> ok, maybe I just misspelled the command when I tried to change it.. thought it said "no such command" in the "server box"
15:30 < boddah> is there a reason, you only can change the damage of the laser?
15:31 <@matricks> not really
15:31 <@matricks> historical reasons
15:31 < boddah> hehe
15:31 <@matricks> other weapon damages where good when the tuning came in
15:31 <@matricks> laser was added at a later stage and therefore got some tuning variables while playtesting it
15:31 < boddah> ah, ok
15:32 < boddah> so im lucky to easily create a way too strong one-shot, 5 -times bouncing laser
15:33 < boddah> a map with lasers only would be nice, but mapping is a thing I never did before -_-
15:33 <@matricks> hehe
15:33 <@matricks> there are instagib mods out there
15:34 <@matricks> I dunno why so many people like instagib
15:34 <@minus> because it's easy
15:34 < Dunedune> it's more acessible
15:34 <@matricks> *mumble* *mumble* YOU DARN KIDS, GET OFF MY LAWN!
15:35  * minus plays some quake with matricks
15:36 <@matricks> yay
15:36 <@matricks> I played a lot of q3 :)
15:36 <@matricks> q3 and teeworlds are kinda similar
15:36 <@minus> i played a bit of warsow
15:36 < boddah> on LAN it's cool, so the players who arent good in the game get some frags, too
15:36 <@matricks> hehe
15:36 <@minus> playing teeworlds for the first time is very hard
15:37 <@minus> hooking-wise
15:43 < boddah> thanks for the answers, cu
