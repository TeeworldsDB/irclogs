15:21 <@minus> looks like you need more RAM
15:21 < EastByte> indeed
15:21 <@minus> then again i just have 6GB
15:21 < BotoX> that's on a server btw >_>
23:00 < heinrich5991> BotoX: how does one read that top output?
23:00 < heinrich5991> I haven't been able to do that yet
23:34 < pielover88888> Edible: Wait, were you the guy that helped me complete Kobra 2 on DDrace?
23:39 < pielover88888> Hi BotoX
23:39 < Edible> hey pielover88888 !
23:39 < Edible> i am, yes :)
23:39 < pielover88888> Hey Edible!
23:40 < pielover88888> I was wondering if anyone was working on a (hopefully serverside) bot for OpenFNG/BoomFNG
23:41 < pielover88888> And, how come nobody's released the source of any of their server-side bots?
23:41 < pielover88888> Is it too easy to make a client-side bot with it, which would be very bad..?
23:43 < Edible> and now... the waiting game
23:43 < pielover88888> I know, right?
23:44 < Edible> :) part of irc. botox did that great trivia bot the other day
23:44 < pielover88888> he made that bot?
23:44 < Edible> awesome bot BotoX :)
23:44 < Edible> yeah! didnt you see it?
23:44 < Edible> it was a bot that entered every room and spammed to see if anyone wanted to trivia
23:45 < pielover88888> that annoying little *bleep* that makes (only one) person per OpenFNG server say "start" and then it distracts the entire amount of players?
23:45 < Edible> yeah!
23:45 < pielover88888> Damn, I hate that thing.
23:45 < Edible> it was awesome
23:45 < pielover88888> I mean, it's great, but it should need a majority rule for it to start.
23:46 < Edible> you can always just ignore it
23:46 < pielover88888> no, I can't.
23:46 < Edible> :O?
23:46 < Edible> how can you not?
23:46 < pielover88888> See, in a 4v4 fng match and 5 people stop playing, it can get really boring (or really OP for one team to not care about it and one team to care) and now I can't see what i've typed.
23:47 < Edible> but what does that have to do with not ignoring it?
23:47 < pielover88888> ...
23:47 < pielover88888> it makes it unplayable, because 5 out of 8 people stopped playing without moving to spectators.
23:47 < pielover88888> Perhaps it could only do it to spectators and do say_team?
23:48  * pielover88888 may not respond.
23:48 < Edible> mmm nope, because its helpful to the ones that use it, say, you're stuck in a ddrace or so
23:48 < Edible> you cant really spectate
23:48 < Edible> unless you /pause
23:48 < Edible> and there are some servers that dont even have that
23:54 < pielover88888> Then only on combat-gametypes should it use the spectating option. Also, when it joins, it can say "Spectate for triviabot!" or something. Back, btw.
23:55 < pielover88888> spectator-chat option*
