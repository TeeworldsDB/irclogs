15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `-4 others`? @Dune
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if i switch to the normal fokkonaut (the one that is in the top of the list) it says 2 others, not negative
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> something to see with dummies maybe?
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> probably not
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> try to identify when it happens and file an issue with what you know ^^
16:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it happens if you are at the bottom of the last and there are more players online than fit in the scoreboard
16:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> of the list*
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dbg_dummies 63;reload ðŸ˜„
16:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I dont need dbg_dummies, i have my own ones :)
19:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> looking for come c++ help ðŸ˜„ https://github.com/jxsl13/zcatch/blob/623ffd91114624a297dfea47daec1b23f9c91144/src/game/server/gamemodes/zcatch.cpp#L138
19:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I do not understand, why the Description (reference) is not updated properly
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> basic flow is: register callback to handle votes, someone votes -> description is matched -> callback is executed on ClientID, Description, Command and Reason , each of there are stored values, that are intended to be mutable by the callbacks. What doesn't work is that if someone joins, that the Description is properly updated.
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might be the double async server access part :/
