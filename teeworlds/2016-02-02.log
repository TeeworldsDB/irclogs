00:39 < Mivel> hey anyone on who can help me with compiling bam and teeworlds?
00:43 <@heinrich5991> what's the problem? :)
00:46 < Mivel> when I try to compile bam, it doesnt find visual studio 14
00:47 < Mivel> I have it installed, but the batch keeps telling me I need to install it
00:48 < Mivel> im gonna try the code::blocks way real quick
01:03 <@heinrich5991> it might be that it doesn't know about visual studio 14
01:03 <@heinrich5991> I don't remember, sorry :/
04:22 < eeeee> Mivel: try running bam from the visual studio command prompt http://blogs.msdn.com/blogfiles/profiler/WindowsLiveWriter/VS2010Silverlight4profiling_BD30/image_thumb_1.png

23:38 < Phobos_> How can i launch my own master server?
23:39 <@heinrich5991> download teeworlds, compile with bam mastersrv
23:39 <@heinrich5991> but why do you want to do that? :)
23:39 <@heinrich5991> you need to distribute your master server with clients, otherwise no one will connect to it
