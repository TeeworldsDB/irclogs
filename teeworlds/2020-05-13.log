11:11 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq lol check this out a 10k star 400 contributor repo with 9 open issues and 0 open pullrequests
11:11 < ChillerDragon> would be nice to get tw prs and issues under 10 as well o.O I thought it is impossible to have big and old projects so clean
11:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Feel free to start doing issues
12:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> This would also require closing issues a lot more aggressively, something you probably don't want
17:19 < ChillerDragon> When starting the server with valgring i get this https://paste.zillyhuhn.com/eC
17:19 < ChillerDragon> is that bad?
17:20 < ChillerDragon> @Dune yea sure I know a agressive issue strategy helps a lot but yea one still can have wishes right ? :D
17:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> That's bad yes
17:22 < ChillerDragon> ==13547== LEAK SUMMARY:
17:22 < ChillerDragon> ==13547==    definitely lost: 108 bytes in 1 blocks
17:22 < ChillerDragon> is that what i think it is?
17:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You forgot to free something
17:22 < ChillerDragon> me?
17:22 < ChillerDragon> its current master
17:22 < ChillerDragon> run for 10 sec
17:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> then the current master is forgetting to free sth
17:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> should be a quick pr
17:23 < ChillerDragon> o.O ?
17:23 < ChillerDragon> maybe we can get valgrind in the ci what do you think?
17:23 < ChillerDragon> make teeworlds stable again :D
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Teeworlds needs a lot of tests tbh
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> but yes we could run the debug build with valgrind or build with ASAN
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I've seen worse than 108 bytes
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @Ryozuki ever worked with gobuffalo.io?
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> i use go-echo
19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does it use webpack etc? for bundling out of the box?
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> go-echo seems like backend only?
19:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, TLS out of the box :O.
19:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, caddy ðŸ˜„
19:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and no ORM :/
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> i use go-echo for backend gorm for orm
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> but now im using rust, https://rocket.rs/
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> not into rust, yet, maybe one das.
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> day
21:57 < minus> teeworlds has CI? ðŸ¤”
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> very minimal, but it does have CI these days
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> checks for compilation failures and a handful of tests
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> full test coverage when? ðŸ˜›
22:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> probably never with the way teeworlds is pieced together, not really minimal testable pieces
