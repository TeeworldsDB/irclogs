01:08 < louis> im a little skilled in sound design so i guess i could help out but looks like someones already good with it
01:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> are you able to do tee sounds but muffled as if they were in the water? ^^
01:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I have a little bit experience with sound design too I may try something later with FL studio have an idea
02:46 < louis> @stiopaa if u just mean muffling alr existing sounds thats eaasy but for new custom sounds i could but they might not be the best lol
02:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> ðŸ¤¨ shouldn't the muffling effect to be done in code tho
02:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> i don't see why we should double the assets for an effect.
02:50 < louis> @tsfrefedie yes
02:51 < louis> lol
02:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> iirc muffling is a low pass filter. probably could a dirty one really quick during mixing.
03:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> essentially that's what I'm doing rn in Fl studio with the default equalizer so if u could code this that would be great but  personally I think we could get something of more quality if done in audio software but I don't know were the limits are with coding it so hmm if it helps in any way this EQ curve seems to work nice for muffed sound https://gyazo.com/455fe720e06f2f1843b6e9dab604838f
03:12 < louis> lol wont that max out
03:14 < louis> also btw u could have a nice looped underwater white noise thing if u wanted
03:14 < louis> but it might be a little too much sound, tw doesnt have any ambient noise in the first place so having it only for water would be weird
03:15 < louis> also i thought it would be kinda cool to have wind sounds activate if your tee reaches high speeds
03:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> simple EQ (snapshot I sent): https://www.dropbox.com/s/b6vfecf3jpzrjjk/tw-uwater_muffled_EQ.mp3?dl=0
03:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> same + triangular Lowpass Effect: https://www.dropbox.com/s/wp2af83ku84vkol/tw-uwater_muffled_EQ%2BtriangularLowpassFX.mp3?dl=0
10:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i like the underwater sounds... as Zatline said, i think it is best to code that filter. Using static audio files with the eq applied does not sound right
10:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> please bring me up to date regarding water etc.. is this a planned tw feature?
10:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i can look for some water splashing sound etc...
11:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well technically I don't think oy ever said he wants it, so it's the most polished feature test branch in tw history :P
11:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> Inspired by the issue, I decided to make a conceptual build based upon https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2740 that has grown far outside of the "conceptual" kind of sphere. The changes are committed to https://github.com/Stiopa866/teeworlds/tree/harpoon and other related branches with the harpoon_ prefix. I also share a download link from time to time to the build. The changes are tested on the "Water Test" server managed
11:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Oy said has to be designed good.
11:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I think the progress it is not bad. And it is actually being play tested it seems.
11:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> But the refactoring might take some time to make the entire thing KISS.
11:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> oh wow cool ðŸ˜„
11:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> nice work guys
11:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i will search for some sounds for sure
11:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Btw, what is up with all the new demo versions of messages in 0.7?
11:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you mean the demo snapshot items?
11:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> since you're supposed to be able to jump to any point in the demo, the players are still stored as snapshot items
11:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but that means they have a limited name length whereas the server does not, leading to incorrect demos
12:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Oh that sounds awful ðŸ˜„
12:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> I mean it is probably still better than csgo's playback everything up to the position you jumped to.
12:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well we could take a page out of video compression i frames
12:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> True
12:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> When saving the demo we could associate a complete information frame for every nth snapshot
12:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> But I frame would probably still be snapshot hence having the same problem if something's length changed in the future
12:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Then we only need to playback n-1 ticks at most which would be instant for almost any sensible n
12:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well an associated bit of information doesnâ€™t need to be in the snap itself at all
12:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> But back scrubbing is usually laggy for videos to.
12:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Too*
12:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Back scrubbing as in going in reverse?
12:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Ye. With mouse probably.
12:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I guess thatâ€™s more caused by the p frames
12:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> With complete information at any nth frame it really shouldnâ€™t be too laggy at all as you donâ€™t need to playback much
12:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Also we can just add a compression since demo data is much more compressible than raw videos anyway
12:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Atleast I think itâ€™s less ugly than weird snapshot items that only occur in demos
12:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Iframes are still snapshots tho. No?
12:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well yes some snapshots would be designated as i frames, but that doesnâ€™t mean we need to store the information in the snap itself
12:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> This is vanilla, we can extend the demo format however we want
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> ðŸ‘€
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> We can index into an information table at the end of the demo
12:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> we can probably do this for every frame without p frames
12:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Every snapshot might be a little too much
12:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @Stiopa do you have a download link for me please?
12:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Though there is always the issue of snapshots and netmsgs being technically completely disconnected
13:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> http://www.mediafire.com/file/4ndg9zv7bwdq2v4/teeworldswater.zip/file it's the animated water build, a bit unstable at times FYI
13:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Stiopa> I don't have the time to reupload the stable build right now
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Stiopa where is the water test server
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @TsFreddie
14:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Oh
14:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Overdue. Forgot to pay
14:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
14:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> Idk why the invoice already got marked as spam
14:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie ðŸŒˆ> just payed the invoice, probably will be back up soon
17:53 < Erte> ???
