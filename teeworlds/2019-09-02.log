00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> skins are lightweight, we can afford to increase üôÇ
01:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> been trying to nail that leopard / jaguar thing

01:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> looks like some sea animal's scales
01:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> that's not what I was goin for üòÑ
01:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> hmmm
01:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> jaguar pattern.
11:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> I would really love to see such development sketches in the main menu of Teeworlds and Steam as news. üëç
12:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> We can do a dev blog post once we settle on them, but this might be a bit premature :)
12:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/jxsl13/zcatch/blob/83021c70db7e1b3cb88a7c9ecc8d7250dafe9fe2/src/game/server/gamemodes/zcatch/voteoptionserver.cpp#L68 could someone tell me, why when I try to send the ClearVote message, that was previously put into the vector causes the ```[2019-09-02 12:21:58][netclient]: chunk payload too big. 134203422(this number changes each time). dropping chunk``` . cou <message clipped>
12:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> this*
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @jxsl13 I'd suggest making your code single threaded and see if you can reproduce the error.
15:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> somehow getting a negative Size value passed Oo
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, found the problem üòÑ `CMsgPacker` has no real copy constructor, thus using garbage values.
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as end & current pointers
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thanks for the advice, @LordSk
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> np
17:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Its so funny that on my old sound system the menu and scoreboard makes a sound xxD
17:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
17:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> when i launch i get a montone beep in the background and it changes depending on what is displayed. So it hear when the scoreboard is open or different menu pages xxxD
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> for the blind teeworlds players (Y)
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> lol @Dune i just noticed you improved logs for external parsing. I was able to get the teams in 0.6 already. The only problem was that shuffle teams was silent in the logs.
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Just keep track on join what id joins what team no need for printing it out every kill imo.
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2207
19:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I would rather show in the logs who joined what team after team shuffle than put teams everywhere
19:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon chillhuh did I ever touch logs
19:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah sowwy
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> idk why i thought it is u
19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> who is allanlegalstart
19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> http://puu.sh/EcAtz/ad72df1519.png
19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> saw this thought its u
19:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I agree
