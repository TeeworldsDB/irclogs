19:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Anyone here who knows a lot about snapshots?
19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you blew snapshot size :0
19:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> What?
19:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xD
19:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you could try explaining what symptoms you observe. or what you want to achieve
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> emoticons rely on the current game tick, which is sent with each snapshot: https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/master/src/game/client/components/players.cpp#L605-L619
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Snapshots are only sent every second tick with sv_high_bandwith 0 (default), which causes the emoticons to not look good
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> on nobys server you can see how smooth emoticons should look like
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i tried to "fake" that snap inbetween with an empty snap only containing the current gametick, so that emoticons would look smoother, but that didnt work out and only gave me weird stuff like flickering scoreboard and others xD
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I have no idea if its even possible to do so, but it sounded like a good idea to use a snap empty between each normal snapshot
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> because i can definitely not go with high bandwith mode for my 128 player server, tried that that would be too much cpu usage, i already optimized many parts of my code to fit 128 players
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> smooth emoticons is a touch itself i really love, and I would really want to hack it in somehow without sending a snapshot each tick
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I had this in mind because I thought the server is sending an empty snap whenever nothing has changed, maybe i implemented it wrong but i dont know
19:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/2946632d7ae282a3d3f669bd9bc6a53c85d8f792/src/game/client/components/players.cpp#L605-L619 (permalink)
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 no idea? :(
19:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> is my idea even correct? xD
19:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> idk, I'm trying to figure it out
19:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> o.o
20:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> does this work? @fokkonaut https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/pull/3958
20:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> It makes it smoother indeed, but not perfect I'd say, let me quickly compare it
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yeah no, its not the same, it has one or two parts where its jumping a bit
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't see the difference, unfortunately, not even between my version and the default one
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you don't happen to have a video? ðŸ˜›
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> > unfortunately, not even between my version and the default one
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what? xD
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> one sec
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> sv_high_bandwith 0 + normal ddnet
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/866748001493319721/Base_Profile_2021.07.19_-_20.25.16.02.mp4
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i zoom wait
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I rememner playing fng and yeah, I also felt that those emoticons there were so smooth and their cooldown/delay was perfect when you spam your emote key.
20:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> remember
20:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @noby send code
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> >;()
20:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thats sv_high_bandwidth
20:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/866749346656682045/Base_Profile_2021.07.19_-_20.31.12.05.mp4

20:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> high bandwidth 1
20:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> you see, the last part is still jumpy
20:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991
20:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> those are both without the above patch?
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
20:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> can you also record a video with the patch?
20:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i am about to, but still ingame xD
20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/866752504480923678/Base_Profile_2021.07.19_-_20.43.37.09.mp4

20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> without and with high bandwidth 1
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so yes, yours does definitely make it better than without your patch
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but not as perfect as with bandwidth 1
20:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 ^
21:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm, I can't find the correct timekeeping ðŸ˜¦
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> That's sad :/
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> could you try and help me on the other side with the server side hack?
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> because SNAPEMPTY seems to clear everything
22:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> less motivated ^^
22:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it feels like the proper fix is in the client
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> imo it's server side, cuz of fng experience (I used the gamer client)
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> do you mean the proper fix is serverside?
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Its not, sv_high_bandwitdth just sends snaps every tick instead of every second tick. With each snapshot the clients gets to know the current m_Tick, which means with sv_high_bandwidth 0, the client only gets every second tick, or knows about every second tick, which slows down the animation or makes it glitchy/jumpy
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> So the fix is definitely in the client :D
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> oh is that why
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> lol
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> good to know
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <noby> ive had a few ppl ask me about that
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> And I said this since many months already :D
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :0
