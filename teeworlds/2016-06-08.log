00:34 < necropotame> hi
00:35 < necropotame> my server face several ddos attacks by vali (to attract players to his infclass server)
00:36 < necropotame> Any idea about what to do ?
00:36 < necropotame> Or I just need to wait that the kid grow up ?
00:39 < deen> necropotame: depends, do you have proof?
00:40 < necropotame> I ask for tips, not necessary for ban or so
00:41 < deen> you can buy a server with better ddos protection for more money, or report him to the police
00:41 < necropotame> No, I don't have proof. But each time my server is ddos, vali is alone on his Illuminati server.
00:42 < necropotame> Waiting players
00:45 < BotoX> which country are you server located at
00:45 < BotoX> that sentence came out fucked, *which country are your servers located at
00:45 < necropotame> France (OVH)
00:46 < BotoX> Oh, that's nice. Sadly they don't offer UDP protection on their lower end
00:46 < BotoX> Your best bet is to get the GAME-1 from SYS
00:46 < BotoX> https://www.soyoustart.com/ie/offers/game-1.xml
00:46 < necropotame> :/
00:46 < deen> BotoX: I believe I tried that and it didn't help against vali's DDoS attacks
00:47 < BotoX> Probably application specific then
00:47 < BotoX> you should tcpdump that
00:47 < BotoX> the next time it happens
00:47 < BotoX> and provide a sample here
00:47 < deen> We (DDNet) are at nfoservers now, only one that worked so far
00:47 < BotoX> Have you set up the UDP protection at OVH properly?
00:47 < BotoX> Aka. add the ports you are using to the firewall
00:48 < BotoX> It works fine for me for SRCDS (CS: S)
00:48 < necropotame> I will check that
00:48 < BotoX> Well that is only a thing on their DDoS Pro or the GAME servers
00:48 < necropotame> Ok, so no
00:48 < deen> No idea, wasn't my own server, just got access from someone who works at OVH and he said he set it up properly. Anyway, long ago so no idea
00:49 < BotoX> the normal servers only have TCP ddos protection
00:49 < BotoX> oh, I see
00:49 < necropotame> I've just a cheap vps at OVH
00:50 < BotoX> the next time it happens necropotame, check htop (CPU load) and tcpdump -n udp dst port 8303
00:50 < BotoX> and pipe that into somewhere xd
00:50 < deen> But anyway, since vali is DDoSing everyone in Teeworlds for about 2 years now, maybe someone should finally report him to the police
00:50 < necropotame> But I can login during a ddos ?
00:50 < BotoX> You should still be able to ssh into your VPS?
00:50 < BotoX> Or is it just completly gone
00:50 < deen> necropotame: no, usually not with OVH, the attacks kill everything
00:50 < necropotame> I never try :p
00:51 < BotoX> Never have for me deen
00:51 < BotoX> though you said it's been a while ago for you
00:51 < deen> what I did was run a script to automatically record when lots of traffic comes in
00:52 < necropotame> Basically, why he did that ?
00:53 < deen> necropotame: why vali ddoses? for fun and to kill other servers I guess
00:53 < necropotame> But then why he try to get player on his server ?
00:55 < necropotame> I mean, it useless. Player can still play, and if he do shit as admin, player will go back to other alternatives
00:57 < deen> Ask him, I can't claim to understand him
00:58 < necropotame> :p
00:59 < BotoX> Actually he has been mentioned in another teeworlds related channel I am in
00:59 < BotoX> and it seems like this guy is hosting a bunch of teeworlds servers for other people
01:00 < BotoX> and ddosing popular ones to populate his servers
01:00 < necropotame> Yes, illuminati
01:00 < BotoX> I think Rafael, EastByte and WolfAlex were talking about it
01:03 < BotoX> Time for bed, I'd love to help you out but I only have a server at their BHS datacenter with UDP protection :v
01:03 < necropotame> np
01:03 < Rafael> gn
01:03 < necropotame> Good night
01:53 < Rafael> http://puu.sh/pkFkm/73ddda35df.png fake server online with fake playernames show up in vannila client too ._.
02:08 <@heinrich5991> Rafael: what do you mean by "fake server"?
02:08 <@heinrich5991> is it pretending to be your server?
02:09 < Rafael> yes
02:10 <@heinrich5991> is it also redirecting to your server?
02:12 < Rafael> when i made the screenshot yes but now he changed it to a normal server i think there a many dummies when i connected to the server right now
02:12 <@heinrich5991> ok
02:13 < Rafael> he always trying to have so many dummies like i have real players on my server
02:16 <@heinrich5991> Rafael: check back later, ok? I'd like to go to bed :)
02:16 < Rafael> ok gn
08:34 < EastByte> good morning necropotame 
22:31 < Jesusrettet> Shalom - Jesus is GOD
