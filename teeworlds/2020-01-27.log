14:15 < day> ChillerDragon: pls del the bot D:
14:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> z7?
14:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> u can write !disconnect in chat day
14:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is it possible to define something like #define `MACRO_CONFIG_INT(Name,ScriptName,def,min,max,flags,desc)`, but adding a parameter which is optional? so for example `MACRO(p1, p2, p3, pOptional)`? so i could pass 3 or 4 parameters there?
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> not afaik
14:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ok thanks
14:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Use inline functions instead?
14:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nah
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> macros in C++ should really be edge cases
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But: I could redefine a macro?
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there aren't many reasons to use them
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can do that yes
14:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> mh
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> variadic arguments are possible in macros, but to me it seems like a Pain in the butt :D
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> sometimes the question is not whether you can do it but whether you should
16:11 < day> chillerdragon: super annoying when everyone instantly spams it anyways
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> :/
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> you could also finally become mod and ban him hehe
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> can you ip ban localhost?
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its not localhost
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i was told thats illegal
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes but rhetorical question
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> u cant
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i think
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well its my local ip so you ban me as well xD
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes but can server work with its own ip banned
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i dont think u can ban localhost at all
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> see wrong rcon attempts on local server
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> if you edit the code so that its possible it should still work
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but local econ connections might fail
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> do you guys think i get set on some watchlist if i hit github bandwith limits this month in about 3 organisations and 4 repositorys already? ðŸ˜„
21:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what about a base64 + json container format for skins?
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm?
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> whats that and how does it look like @jxsl13 ?
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> image encoded as base64 string
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> text file with with some json key value pairs
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> where the values are such a string
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> that would be nice so everything can be in one file. But then the image preview is lost.
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> kinda only for portability, for visibility one might need to import it into tw
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 wouild prefer a common archive format for this, like zip
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> most people do not have a zip preview either i guess
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well opening
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but ye..
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> most people can double-click a zip and open pictures
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> not so much for some weird base64-encoded pngs in a json
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea
22:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> if its a zip we could also use a simple folder xd
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that cannot be shared so easily
22:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> minecraft texture packs also exist as zips (for that reason, I'd wager)
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> text file vs zip
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> anyone c++ expert? ðŸ™‚
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> how do I stop a destructor of a member variable from being run?
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in the least awful way
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I guess the least awful way would be to put it behind a pointer and manually manage its memory
23:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> why would want to stop a destructor in the first place?
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> because you have a class that closes its file in the destructor
23:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you want to invoke that early, to check the file's contents afterwards
23:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but after you close the file, the class would probably still try to close the file again in its automatically called destructor
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> what I meant to say, the problem can probably solved before having to cancel a destructor
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> sure, I'm open to that
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> my best guess was the solution above
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it's okayish, but requires an unnecessary allocation, but it's fine in this case
23:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> make member a pointer
23:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yea, what I thought https://discordapp.com/channels/407308363031117832/490150878934990850/671475655149617173
