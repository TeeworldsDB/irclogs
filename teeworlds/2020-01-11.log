00:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I wonder if nametags could hold more than 16 bytes as well as color codes in order to create prefixes and or ranks or whatever
00:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> at least visible information that a client can receive being more than a client can actually set
00:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> :üëç
00:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> üëç
00:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> would be cool if there was a seperate text field above or under the name, just like the show clan tag in playername
02:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I wonder why OSX is the only build that fails on `const vec4 (&aColors)[] = {HealthColor, ArmorColor, AmmoColor};`
02:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what the heck is that syntax
02:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [Identifyy Host|msg me]> ^
04:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ```
04:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (&aColors)[]
04:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ```
04:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> this part especially
11:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's an array of references
11:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I thought that'd be C++ compliant and my gcc seems to agree
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> stackoverflow says no arrays of references Oo
13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it seems
13:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the parenthesis' kinda look weird there ._., confused me.
13:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> You don't want a reference on an array
13:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Can I thread a function in ListDirectory?
13:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> `Storage()->ListDirectory(IStorage::TYPE_ALL, Path, TestCallback, this);`
13:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in this case TestCallback?
14:34 < Dune> Oy: hm, getting LNK errors when I git clone teeworlds && bam :/
14:34 < Dune> I think that's related to recent changes?
14:35 < Dune> (win7)
14:36 < Oy> Dune: both clean repos?
14:37 < Dune> well teeworlds is freshly cloned
14:37 < Dune> what's the second repo, bam?
14:38 < Oy> i'll try
14:40 < Oy> x64 or x86?
14:40 < Oy> cl?
14:40 < Oy> what link errors do u get?
14:40 < Dune> x64 cl
14:41 < Dune> FT & SDL
14:41 < Oy> ok trying that
14:42 < Dune> bam is on master
14:44 < Oy> everything ok for me 
14:44 < Oy> could you do a bam config?
14:44 < Oy> and paste the output?
14:44 < Dune> sure
14:45 < Dune> ah, that's it
14:45 < Dune> bam finds mingw somehow
14:45 < Dune> forgot about that issue I get with fresh repos
14:45 < Dune> sorry for bugging :)
14:45 < Oy> np :)
14:45 < Oy> should probably do a gcc x64 check
15:08 < Dune> oh, sounds good
15:17 < Oy> should work now
15:19 < Dune> I'll try
15:20 < Dune> works! cheers
15:20 < Oy> :)
15:27 < Dune> o/
15:27 < Robyt3> hey
15:27 < Dune> cheers
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> hello
15:28 < Robyt3> I'm currently working on multiple joystick support. Do you know whether I should save SDL_JoystickInstanceID or the UUID?
15:30 < Dune> UUID seems to be SDL2 specific
15:30 < Dune> not sure if it matters, aren't both unique?
15:31 < Robyt3> instance id looks unique over restarting teeworlds to me
15:31 < Robyt3> UUID seems more fool proof
15:31 < Dune> Ah
15:31 < Dune> Yeah
15:31 < Dune> The GUID is build by squishing the bus, vendor, product and version numbers into a single value according to https://askubuntu.com/a/368711/843955
15:32 < Dune> Should be UUID to me
15:32 < Dune> Oy ^
15:42 < Robyt3> I'll change it to use the UUID and add some caching for the active joystick
15:43 < Robyt3> I'll do a pull request later today
15:43 < Robyt3> And get some food now first
15:57 < Dune> day: forgot, you have multiple joysticks?
16:35 < Oy> yeah should be the joystick guid when u wanna save settings etc.
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Robyt3 is on a spree üòÑ
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Are there any features or plans for multiple rcon passwords or some sort of individual authentication to track which admin is acting?
19:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> pls give more space for gametype string xD
19:05 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> Hey, there need to be handicaps for this game
19:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> There is support for moderators. For the average server this should be enough I think
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what kinda handicaps?
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and why
19:06 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> like skill disparity handicaps
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> propose the removal of dyn cam
19:06 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> because the number one experience for a new player is to come in, get smashed by someone they can't touch, and then ragequit and move on to other games with more mechanics of fairness.
19:07 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> basically if your score outstrips the other players, it seems like your HP should go down or your weapon effectiveness etc
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> true, that's for modders and server hosters to regulate I'd say ._.
19:07 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> eh, I think that there should be some baseline default
19:07 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> "this makes the game playable for noobs too"
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there are skill level icons
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but well, dunno if anyone benefits from them in any way
19:08 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> yeah but noobs don't know those and that's not an actual solution, just a human ranking thing
19:08 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> yeah I have seen them
19:08 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> contextually, I've known teeworlds exists for like a month now
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Due to the low number of players all skill levels play on the same server anyway
19:08 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> yeah
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as there is no login system and whatnot to track players, it's kinda hard to prevent people from playing on specific players.
19:09 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> basically it should take less hits to kill advanced player, or their hits should do less damage, or both
19:09 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> and, the way to track this is at the level of in-game score
19:10 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> if somebody's score gets to be 2x everybody else's? adjust their HP or damage down
19:10 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> or even, maybe some fun mechanic like "the higher your score is the less bullets your guns hold"
19:11 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> make it possible to still win but definitely even the playing field a bit
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm trying to make zCatch accessible for beginners, but it's far from perfect. it prevents some long time players from playing on the beginner server, but due to too few players the server gets rarely full.
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> changing gameplay mechanics to create a disadvantage for pro players is kinda unfair
19:12 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> as a noob zcatch is infuriating
19:12 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> the whole game for me is seeing if I can make the advanced players die sometimes when they're killing me
19:12 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> yes jxt that's the point
19:13 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> it needs to be unfair towards them because it's unfair towards everybody else because of them
19:13 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> they're preventing there being other pro players
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's why the beginner server exists, it tries to prevent players with a score of 35 or higher to play there, but as there are no accounts and so on, people could bypass the prevention
19:13 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> yeah but that mechanism 1) either doesn't work outright or 2) is insufficient
19:14 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> and as already pointed out, the low numbers of people playing means everybody goes to one server anyway
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> uff, dune playing destiny 2
19:14 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> I kind of like the idea of shot restriction, down to maybe 3 rounds or something for somebody 30 kills ahead of everybody else
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm thinking about regulating health
19:15 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> yeah health is the standard
19:15 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> but there's a lot of options
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> instead of anything else
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but how would one determine a pro player
19:15 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> well the appeal for me is, some people have shit defense but good offense? and vice versa
19:16 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> so you could optimize to their level on each of these dimensions
19:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> sounds easy, not xD
19:16 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> well the basic determination is in-game score disparity
19:16 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> somebody getting way ahead
19:16 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> because that's just an integer the server tracks anyway
19:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there are a lot of 0.5.2 players coming back, at least to zcatch that have a score of 0
19:17 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> uuuh k
19:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe kd?
19:17 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> it's not the worst idea but the in-game-score thing works as well on noobs and anonymized players as everyone else
19:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> some people don't accumulate a score, like nameless tee
19:18 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> yeah, but you have an ID for the player on the server that's using that name
19:18 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> and you, haven't grokked the code but theoretically, you can aggregate the amount of damage done by each player?
19:18 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> and lower the damage done by the most-dealing player and up the damage done by the least
19:19 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> eh that also sounds like it could be frustrating, imagine being in last place because you get everybody down to 1 heart but someone else always kills them kind of thing
19:20 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> but, there needs to be something to address this
19:20 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> this is a thing
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, if damage is accumulated
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it would not matter?
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but it's not used for scoring, tho
19:21 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> yeah but that's the idea, use the data there to regulate game fairness
19:25 < rand> sound like a bad idea, better find an idea for a training system
19:27 < rand> zcatch is frustrating because it's a survival gametype, you have to wait before spawning, that's why instagib is popular for newcomers
19:31 < rand> hm, is there an flag for tees not to test tees collision ? I was thinking about ghost tees, like in race games (trackmania/mario kart)
19:32 < Oy> a general one, should be tunings. player collision
19:38 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> rand no there's a real problem of the guys who can play at some certain level, making everybody else ragequit, and this really needs to be fixed
19:48 < Dune> JewZeus: yeah zCatch is terrible if you're not in the top %
19:49 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> not just zcatch, but all gametypes
19:49 < Dune> I think zcatch is particularly punitive 
19:49 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> there's gametypes that the whole game is to be better at navigating than you can get playing the vanilla game
19:49 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> zcatch is yeah
19:49 < Dune> but yeah all PvP gametypes are probably not fun if you're at the bottom of the bucket
19:50 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> the problem is 'the bottom' is the bottom 80% of the bucket
19:50 < Dune> ctf is a bit like that by design
19:50 < Dune> if you are worse than the flagger there is no way you can do shit to it because he'll just go faster and spam grenades back
19:50 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> eh that speeds up getting to the next map
19:50 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> but a bunch of servers freeze it on one map
19:50 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> so that doesn't actually work
19:50 < Dune> almost all do
19:51 < Dune> that's why most players play TDM in the middle in ctf5
19:51 < Dune> because you can't do shit if the flagger is a better player (and it tends to be the best player of the server, cause others die with the flag)
19:51 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> eh there's no single flagger I've ever seen
19:52 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> unless one player is far and away an example of needing to have some kind of adjustment to his outputs in the game, for the sake of everyone else, as already mentioned
19:52 < Dune> maybe not just one, but certainly some of the better players
19:52 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> right
21:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 doesn‚Äôt the new wide browser give more space?
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Regarding 
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> > pls give more space for gametype string xD
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it doesn't seem that it gives any more space to gametypes
21:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe half an ascii character wise
21:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Hm I don‚Äôt know I just looked at map names
21:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Was super upset I could not differentiate ChillerDragores20-29 maps because it was chopped of
21:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But the wider browser solved it üôÇ

22:19 < Dune> I do

22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maps are not being copied into my build fodler
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> folder
22:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> most likely
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> usually one creates a build folder in cmake in order not to build in source
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> data/maps -> datasrc/maps ?
22:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, datasrc doesn't exist in the build folder üò¢
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you're not building in the source folder, right?
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah, there is a copy action missing somewhere to copy the maps into the build/data/. folder
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no, I'm building in the build fodler
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> folder
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't think there's a copy action misssing
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> are you usually building in source?
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no one is, that's why it's untested
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok, good
22:33 < Dune> it doesn't work afaik
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> didn't work either anyway üòÆ
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it tried to copy from data/maps
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> moving datasrc/maps to build/data/maps worked for me
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> your logs are unfortunately quite incomplete, so it's hard to tell what went wrong
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> sure
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the code to copy the maps over is there
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> have you seen a warning in the initial cmake output?
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> let me retry from scratch
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> cd ..
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
22:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Dune, could you add this to your gamer repo? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/cbb57765b66477e2a6daf6347e3fd7e9f366ce83#diff-af3b638bc2a3e6c650974192a53c7291
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol, now getting a linker error
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> oh, yeah oy's commit
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's a template netban that is ._.

22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, now it work üòÆ
22:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm I think I know what's the problem, might have been my fault, cuz I did not use cmake .. again after initializing the submodules
22:50 < Dune> @jxsl13 that's from 22 days ago, I'm surprised it's not in there
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Can I thread a function in ListDirectory?Storage()->ListDirectory(IStorage::TYPE_ALL, Path, TestCallback, this);in this case TestCallback?
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, gamer build seems to work fine now
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> after that patch
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I added a pullrequest
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what do you mean, thread?
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i have a folder with 500+ files
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> do you want to start each `TestCallback` in its own thread, or do you want a thread for all these files?
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> laggs quite a bit if i listdir it
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> One for all ofc
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ehm, the dmg package still says teeworlds 0.7.3 .-.
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm. one listdir shouldn't lag‚Ñ¢Ô∏è I think
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is that intended?
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm. one listdir shouldn't‚Ñ¢Ô∏è lag I think
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Heinrich, 500+ files
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> still increasing
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> So, can I thread the whole thing? just one thread to loop throught all files?
22:53 < Oy> @Sonix server full :P
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, you can start a thread and call this function in it
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> how?
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i tried, but couldnt get anything working
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what is the result of your directory listing?
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i have some data in the files, and they will be saved in a vector
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ddnet/0.7?
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 0.7
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Oy sry didnt notce
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> come now
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think there might be a lot of cmake commit missing, I'm not sure
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> btw: another issue with listdir, i tried to run listdir with 1000+ files, and it crashed at some Point, but that is a different thing, the thread is more important now
22:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> So heinrich, how do i thread the listdir
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> either use the job interface of teeworlds, or spawn your own thread
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Whats better?
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't really know tbh
22:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> if you want to know when it's done better use the job interface... just easier
22:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> on ddnet I patched the job interface to be slightly more usable, but that hasn't made it into vanilla yet
22:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, I might be stupid xD
22:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> gamer client on gamer branch üòÆ
22:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but okay, let's do the job interface
22:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yes
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> create a function that you'll call in the new thread
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> oh damn... 0.7 still uses the thread_sleep stuff üòÆ
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes üò¶
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 wdym
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it'll need to have the signature `int Name(void *pUser)`
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Ah wait, you mean thread_init_and_detach(ListDir) and then in ListDir I call the ListDirectory function?
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (looked at file_score)
23:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, but I thought you wanted the job interface
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oh
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i dont even know what that is tbj
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> tbh
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> file_score is not the best source when you want to see proper threading code ^^
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> True
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 int function created
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you probably want to pass it some data, right?
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yea
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Can it have access to gamecontext?
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> then create a struct that contains the data you want to pass it
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that would make it thread-unsafe
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Ah true
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Mh but it would need it :)
23:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> :/
23:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> why?
23:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what data does it need?
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> uhm
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> idk how to explain
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Well
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> can I make it read only?
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> std::future
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no?
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But I can pass the data?
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you need to make a copy of your data that you want the thread to know
23:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Ok.
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> That could work
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._. I do some threading stuff in my mod ._.
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you create a struct with the data that the thread needs
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but not the c way
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> And what if the thread needs a function?
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Also to the struct?
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> put function pointer in struct
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._.
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I definitely need a function in it
23:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Ahh this is complicated rn
23:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> gamer's cmakelists says: file GLOB requires a glob expression after CONFIGURE_DEPENDS.CMake (file)
23:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Gotta eat something, heinrich are you there in 20 minutes?
23:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
23:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> wow... the jobpool is only used for dns lookup üòÑ
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> and sound loading IIRC
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yup
23:18 < Oy> and hostname lookup for favourites
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> ah okay üôÇ
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> what about using semaphore here like ddnet does?
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> why does no one uses semaphores?
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> sounds like a good idea to not burn cpu cycles
23:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the array of references error persists, I removed the parenthesis and it properly said that
23:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ```error: 'aColors' declared as array of references of type 'const vec4 &' (aka 'const vector4_base<float> &'```
23:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you said above that arrays of references are forbidden, right?
23:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that should be the error cause then
23:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah
23:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dune said that he intended to create an array of references
23:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and that it build on gcc
23:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._.
23:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> apparently, it's just disallowed by the standard
23:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it may work in gcc, but that doesn't *mean* anything
23:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah, that's what SO said
23:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> i.e. it needs to be replaced by something else
23:28 < Oy> 1337 * o/
23:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm just gonna replace it with the array without the references
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's a vec4 that's being passed by value
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> probably uses that array to modify it?
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so it might need to be a pointer
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's a const array
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and the function that is being passed elements from that array takes actually no reverences, but the object class vec4
23:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> all values are const within that array
23:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm ok
23:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and the array ist const
23:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is*
23:32 < Oy> heinrich5991: about the version server. could you try to run the 0.7.3.1 one?
23:32 < Oy> to see if that one worked
23:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does anyone know where the sdl2 version requirement of the tw client is specified?
23:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> tells me tw requires version 11.0.0 and I have 1.0.0
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 im back
23:37 < Oy> there shouldn't be a requirement
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @heinrich5991 interesting that the standard doesn't allow that :)
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah you can just remove the reference
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> interesting that clan > gcc >:D
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> apparently it is due to array access decaying to pointer arithmetic and pointers to references not being allowed
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> interesting that clang > gcc >:D
23:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ooh, neat
23:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> client dies at runtime telling me "fu"
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> first it doesn't find th sdl2.framework, dying and then dies after I downloaded and placed the sdl2.framework file into the tw app/Frameworks etc
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> same fun as last time üòÑ
23:40 < Oy> u r on mac?
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ye
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 appearently, i could also make this thing different without using listdir
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i guess
23:40 < Oy> do u compile it urself?
23:40 <@heinrich5991> Oy: 0.7.3.1 versionsrv running
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> trying to compile the gamer client
23:40 < Dune> try to compile master first
23:40 < Oy> heinrich5991: thx
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> tw master or your master, dune?
23:41 < Dune> same
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I did compile the tw master just fine
23:41 < Dune> I don't see why the mod would be different :/
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and it even starts
23:41 < Dune> unless I broke the cmakefiles
23:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I opened a pr, that was giving me errors
23:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 maybe check the git diff of the `CMakeLists.txt`
23:43 < Dune> I'll just enable github actions and troubleshoot it on my own :)
23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I added the tw master as remote origin, kinda merged i into dune's gamer branch
23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and I see no cmakelists diff ._.
23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what's weird
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> doesn't sound too good, the original cmakefiles doesn't work?
23:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> with the pr I opened it works
23:45 < Oy> seems that one doesn't work either :(
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> one message of me was not sent
23:46 < Dune> and without?
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> and without?
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> discord seems to be having problems today
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> e.g. that message didn't get through
23:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @heinrich5991 ive run listdirectory now with 1112 files, and there is this crash: `Run-Time Check Failure #2 - Stack around the variable 'aFileName' was corrupted.`
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you have an out of bounds write somewhere
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> try running it in valgrind
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ah lol
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the cmake .. step already doesn't work
23:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> char size
23:47 < Dune> @jxsl13 yeah it's on me, it seems cmake broke at some point...
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> test
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> discord bad
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> every second message works
23:48 < Dune> come on IRC ;)
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> so the name got longer ` - Kopie`
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i just increased the char array size, now it worked. because i just copied files
23:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we can switch to IRC if you want
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._. irc
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> old but works
23:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> old but works
23:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=teeworlds
23:50 < Oy> heinrich5991: the version server u build, is it x86 or x64?
23:50 <@heinrich5991> 64 bit
23:50 < Dune> so cmake stopped working at some point with my cmakesfile on my mod; that one is on me. I never tested it on OSX, might be why
23:50 < Dune> bam+OSX works
23:51 < Oy> ok
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> bam bad üòÑ
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._.
23:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is ok
23:52 < Dune> I gladly accept cmake fixes ;)
23:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I dunno, would dropping the tw one with your added files work x)?
23:53 < Dune> probably, I did nothing fancy
23:55 < Dune> ah, only cmake generates artifacts? :(
23:56 <@heinrich5991> ddnet only compiles with cmake nowadays, it works quite well
23:56 <@heinrich5991> or has done so for over a year
23:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> bam also uses less strict compiler options
23:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> the workflow job for bam is rather minimalistic
23:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> but it was the same before
