13:20 < BotoX> okay
13:20 < BotoX> floating point problem
13:20 < BotoX> I have application A) that runs on 64bit and for this calculation: a = (0.3333 * 9.0 + 1)/10 ; b = (a * 9.0 + 0)/10
13:21 < BotoX> I get b = 0.359973 on 64bit and b = 0.369973 on 32bit
13:21 < BotoX> Can I emulate this error on a 64bit application somehow?
13:32 <@matricks> huh
13:32 <@matricks> BotoX: that shouldn't happen
13:33 <@matricks> sounds like optimizations gone wrong or something
13:33 < BotoX> I haven't checked if this is actually a 32 bit error though....
13:33 < BotoX> The other program is a plugin for a 32bit game
13:33 <@matricks> I mean, all that should be evaluated in compile time
13:33 < BotoX> no
13:33 < BotoX> it's just an example
13:34 < BotoX> a is not static
13:34 < BotoX> it's calculated on run-time
13:35 <@matricks> compiling with any fancy options?
13:35 < BotoX> I have no idea how the 32bit application has been compiled
13:36 < BotoX> it's something that I haven't written and am trying to get my application to get the same results
13:36 <@matricks> could be that it doesn't conform to floating rules
13:36 <@matricks> then you have to check the assembly and see which order the instructions are done
13:36 <@matricks> and make sure to use the same data types
13:37 < BotoX> It's actually some sort of compiled scripting language
13:37 < BotoX> https://github.com/alliedmodders/sourcepawn/blob/master/compiler/float-value.cpp
13:37 < BotoX> https://github.com/alliedmodders/amtl/blob/master/include/am-float.h
13:37 <@matricks> BotoX: check your datatypes etc
13:38 <@matricks> they are mixing double and floats
13:38 < BotoX> well, mine are correct
13:40 <@matricks> well, check types and order of operation
13:40 <@matricks> and if casts occur in the middle etc
13:41 < BotoX> ok
14:12 < BeaR_> !seen Oy
14:12 < Nimda3> I've last seen Oy 246 days, 18 hours, 33 minutes and 13 seconds ago in #teeworlds saying "take the stuff from here https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/tree/2c4775cf5a328448ff3e81ebf781bc9fedc4f45c/other ;)".
14:14 <@minus> !seen oy_
14:14 < Nimda3> I've last seen Oy_ 334 days, 17 hours, 10 minutes and 40 seconds ago in #teeworlds saying "you need a permission from court if one is 16 other one has to be at least 18".
14:14 <@minus> hmm
14:16 <@matricks> hahahaaha
14:16 < BotoX> so, I tried to join their channel on GameSurge IRC
14:16 < BotoX> and I got kickbanned after 5 seconds
14:16 <@matricks> whos?
14:16 < BotoX> sourcemod
14:16 <@matricks> did you read topic?
14:16 < BotoX> ye
14:16 < BotoX> and rules on their page
14:16 < BotoX> I didn't even say anything
14:17 <@matricks> so you didn't say anything then
14:17 < BotoX> yeah
14:17 <@matricks> need to be regged to be in there or?
14:17 < BotoX> it seemed like a manual ban
14:17 < BotoX> took a few seconds
14:17 < BotoX> tried pm'ing the guy, no response lol
14:17 < BotoX> http://www.sourcemod.net/irc.php
14:17 <@minus> they already know you
14:17 < BotoX> >Absolutely no bots unless authorized.
14:18 < BotoX> Maybe my name "Bot"oX lel
14:18 <@minus> rejoin as NotBotoX then
14:18 < BotoX> heh
14:25 < BotoX> I joined with another nick and and I'm not banned yet :V
14:26 <@matricks> what did the kick say?
14:27 < BotoX> * You have been kicked from #sourcemod by ChanServ ((psychonic) Bye.)
14:27 <@matricks> hmm
14:30 < BotoX> 14:30 <@asherkin> alright, you got caught in the middle of a repeat ban evader join spamming
14:30 < BotoX> 14:30 <@asherkin> sorry about that
14:30 < BotoX> 14:30 < torchlight> lol
14:31 <@matricks> haha, I thought that it might be that :D
14:34 <@minus> false positives â™¥
14:40  * minus hands out cookies
14:57 <@matricks> YAY
14:57 <@matricks> I'm gonna go home today and get soooo fat
14:58 <@matricks> got a bowl full of chocolate mousse that I got for being on cat guard
15:01 <@minus> nice
15:01 <@minus> i have uni until 1830
15:04 < BotoX> cat guard?
15:05 < BotoX> https://www.google.com/search?q=cat+guard&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch
15:05 < BotoX> hmmm
15:05 < BotoX> are you a cat matricks 
15:06 <@matricks> BotoX: cat sitter?
15:06 <@matricks> what do you call it then?
15:06 < BotoX> I don't know what that'd be :V
15:06 <@matricks> feeding cats etc when the owners are gone
15:06 < BotoX> ahhhhhhhhhhhh
16:04 < BotoX> oh well I got it to work finally :p https://p.botox.bz/losu
16:04 < BotoX> now I'm just measuring how many ticks the player is resting on the ground until being in air again
16:04 <@matricks> what are you trying todo?
16:05 < BotoX> measuring "bunny hop performance" in counter-strike source
16:05 < BotoX> aka. doing bunny hop hack detection locally like a plugin does serverside
16:05 < BotoX> so I can avoid being detected by it
16:05 <@matricks> why do you only destroy stuff?
16:06 < BotoX> But I am building things :(
16:06 < BotoX> It's for fun, I guess
16:06 <@matricks> said the people who buitl the atom bomb
16:06 < BotoX> heh
16:07 <@matricks> it's fucking tiring dealing with people like you
16:07 <@matricks> it's partly the reason why I quit developing
16:08 < BotoX> Well, some people like cheating and some don't, it's all about personal preference I guess.
16:09 <@matricks> some people like to screw over other people.. yeah I know
16:09 <@matricks> and those people fucking suck
16:09 <@matricks> personal gain at the expense of others
16:09 < BotoX> It's like david and goliath in my opinion
16:09 < BotoX> one is strong
16:09 < BotoX> he is good
16:09 < BotoX> but the other has knowledge
16:09 < BotoX> and still beats him?
16:09 <@matricks> cheating isn't beating
16:10 <@matricks> it's destroying
16:13 < BotoX> I think some cheats are actually a piece of art: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNTiX8-DX9o

16:14 <@matricks> I don't really care if you are destroying the experience for other people
19:54 <@minus> Good old times when I hacked games
20:00 < Dunedune> minus confirmed haxx0r
20:01 <@matricks> I cracked a game because I got bored waiting for my key to arrive...
20:01 <@matricks> over 5 minutes is too long
20:01 <@minus> i was like 16
20:01 <@matricks> kinda sucks that I went faster for me to crack the game then it took to deliver the key
20:02 <@matricks> took me like 10 minutes of debugging the game before I got it
20:02 <@minus> what game  was it
20:02 < Kottizen> teeworlds.
20:02 <@matricks> gish
20:03 <@minus> yeah, doesn't sound hard to break the licensing on that one
20:03 < Dunedune> How long did it take the key to arrive
20:03 <@matricks> Dunedune: dont remember
20:03 <@matricks> 30 min?
20:03 <@matricks> dunno
20:03 <@matricks> 20?
20:03 < Dunedune> e-mails are that slow?
20:04 <@minus> prolly was busy times
20:04 <@minus> emails take ~1s to deliver if no greylisting or similar is in place
20:06 <@minus> so last semester i had to do a project (software) on the topic of digital signal processing. did the suggested project of a spectrum analyzer. a few days ago i came up with an idea that would've been so much more glorious: a synth. now i'll likely never do it :(
