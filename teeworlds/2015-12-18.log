09:39 < megazonet_> hi
09:39 < megazonet_>  do you like my collection of teeworlds client in www.megazonet.in ?
18:47 <@heinrich5991> "why does teeworlds use udp for map download?" "I think becuz' the UDP is a lot faster than the TCP."
18:48 <@matricks> :D
18:48 <@matricks> because dealing with the complexities of two sockets isn't worth it
18:48 <@matricks> also, UDP can be way faster then TCP
18:48 <@heinrich5991> because it doesn't behave fairly?
18:49 <@matricks> no
18:49 <@matricks> because TCP requires sequencing when UDP doesn't
18:49 <@matricks> if you miss a packet, just continue and rerequest that packet later, no need to stop sending stuff etc
18:49 <@matricks> if your application can handle that
18:49 <@heinrich5991> ok
18:50 <@matricks> when sending stuff over seas, there are some really nice apps that does that faster then TCP
18:50 <@heinrich5991> but teeworlds' network protocol doesn't do this for sequenced packets
18:50 <@matricks> heinrich5991: nope
18:50 <@matricks> heinrich5991: because teeworlds doesn't do bulk transfers :)
18:50 <@heinrich5991> map download. but that's even worse, a RTT for each chunk
18:51 <@matricks> heinrich5991: teeworlds uses UDP because the game needs UDP, dealing with an extra socket is not worth it
18:51 <@heinrich5991> yes, I understand and I agree
18:51 <@matricks> heinrich5991: well, I think it queues 10 chucks at the time, but PL kinda screws it over
18:51 <@matricks> I just call it throtteling so the game server doesn't lag and call it a day :)
18:51 <@heinrich5991> PL?
18:51 <@matricks> packet loss
18:51 <@heinrich5991> ah
18:52 <@heinrich5991> maybe in 0.7
