17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> How did the official mac release got built? If i do make package_dmg it uses different dylibs and fails on libcrypto because it uses my absolute homebrew path
17:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the make_release.py script shows no app icons for me meh
17:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I used make_release.py for all OS
17:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah, nvm I didn't build mac. didn't you do that?
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> @heinrich5991  Your commit https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/51d4945f5803e6987590ddc8aaa3111daa8d5475 sounds like the fix for #2147 ("Trim trailing whitespaces of (Remote)console commands")?
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Slayer *gV* indeed
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> K, i referenced it via comment to the commit. ðŸ™‚ #CleanCode
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> *#CleanHistory, pardon.
18:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> oh, you're sepulzera
18:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ðŸ™‚
18:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Yea, but the name felt too long for a Tee. Most player used to have very short names, at least back then. ðŸ˜„
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ```
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> SlayerSlayer
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> heinrich5991
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ```
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Got that hit my point. ^^
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> *Guess
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> While scrolling through the names in this channel, your name appears to be some of the longest. And one of the few with numbers. Not teeish ðŸ˜„
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune xd ya i think i did one mac rls
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also tried make_release which failed om libpng isntead of libcrypto
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon look for `darwin_change_dylib.py` in `CMakeLists.txt`
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ty
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you need to add something for libcrypto there
19:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea but the official release also has no dylib for crypto in the frameworks folder
19:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how does it work there?
19:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> check it
19:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon `otool -L executable`
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nah doesnt look like
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> http://paste.pr0.tips/sK
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> mh. build with PREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS perhaps?
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> make a clean build directory with `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON`
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I guess I should document this more
19:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Better defaults would be nicer than docs imo
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> CMake Warning:
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon>   Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon>     CMAKE_BUNDLED_LIBS
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> PREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> well, but it is the wrong default for everything but packagain
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> packaging
19:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm
19:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Ah now it looks very similar to the official release thanks ðŸ™‚
20:11 <@Dune> btw https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=938632
20:19 < minus> someone should tell them it works fine with python 3
20:23 <@heinrich5991> and maybe we should just drop py2 support
20:24 <@heinrich5991> it's EOL 2020-01-01
20:31 <@heinrich5991> Dune: how do you get these bug reports?
20:56 <@Dune> heinrich5991: I subscribed to the teeworlds debian mailing list
20:56 <@Dune> Oy: <@Dune> btw https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=938632
20:56 <@Dune> should we drop py2 like heinrich5991 suggested?
20:57 <@Dune> is there no way to make it compatible with both?
20:57 <@heinrich5991> we are compatible with both
20:57 <@heinrich5991> (note that py2 is official end-of-life in 2020, still maintaining compatibility with both isn't really useful IMO)
20:58 <@Dune> py2 is still largley supported :/
20:58 <@Dune> but then there is no issue?
20:58 <@Dune> since you can already build teeworlds with py3
20:58 <@heinrich5991> yes
20:58 <@heinrich5991> Dune: I don't think we have any py2-only setups remaining
20:58 <@heinrich5991> are there?
20:58 <@heinrich5991> https://pythonclock.org/
20:59 <@Dune> I don't know, I use py2 by default
20:59 <@heinrich5991> you should think about a transition I guess ^^
21:00 <@Dune> I use py2 for scripting though :/
21:00 <@heinrich5991> py3 isn't that different
21:01 <@heinrich5991> I guess distros will stop shipping py2 soonishâ„¢. and there's no security updates coming after 2020-01-01
21:02 <@Dune> irc bot died btw
21:02 <@Dune> and yeah I'll probably forcibly transition :)
21:03 <@Dune> got a pc again o/
21:03 <@Dune> pc will not start again if it shuts down though
21:03  * Dune sweats
21:05 <@Dune> was Landil doing the skin stuff back before 0.7?
21:25 < Oy> Dune: yeah everything should work with python3
21:26 < Oy> don't think that python2 compatibility should be removed
21:26 < Oy> what skin stuff?
21:32 <@heinrich5991> I see some discrepancy here :P
21:33 <@heinrich5991> we have no problems dropping thousands of e.g. user-created skins but dropping python2 support or some silly sound option get priority ^^
21:33 <@heinrich5991> *get thrown out of the window for being a bad idea
21:46 <@Dune> working on skins in general
21:49 <@Dune> heinrich5991: well imo maintaining support with a decade of user-created skins would be the highest priority for me :P
21:49 <@heinrich5991> we didn't for 0.7
21:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> So lets go back to the old skin system lol
21:50 <@Dune> yeah, well, different people with different ideas
21:50 <@Dune> I'd be in favor of writing something for backwards compatibility
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Im not a fan of the new skin system but to be fair i did not hear about any skin artist complaining yet
21:51 <@Dune> well, good skin artists should have no problem with it I imagine, it's the higher barrier of entry 
21:53 <@Dune> and it's not so much about new skins than old ones
21:57 < Oy> no old skins haven't been touched for 12 years
21:57 < Oy> probably done around 0.3?
21:58 < Oy> android had a script to convert old skins to the new system
21:59 <@Dune> it never worked though
21:59 < Oy> oh, never tried
21:59 < Oy> just read he made one
22:00 <@Dune> it can probably work with some fixes, not sure
22:03 < Oy> https://github.com/android272/skinMe-script-for-Teeworlds/blob/master/skinMe
22:04 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2021
22:08 < Oy> eyes seem buggy
22:08 < Oy> the script would never be perfect anyway, as the new system is pretty different and you can't extract all the possible information from the old skins
22:09 <@Dune> right :/
22:11 <@Dune> not sure if it could be integrated in teeworlds without rewriting any render part
22:13 < Oy> using the old skins?
22:16 <@Dune> yeah
22:18 < Oy> doubt that, they changed it a lot
22:18 <@Dune> oh, okay
22:18 <@Dune> most people seem to take the new skin system as a positive anyway
22:20 < Oy> the customization is really good
22:20 < Oy> though there could be more options for parts :)
22:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune this shouldnt be in tw. The markings and stuff wouldnt work
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> of course, it's old skins, the markings are part of the body
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> working hard on the skins stuff there is many new markings and body types drawn  already counting over 42 marking currently and around 7 new body types and a few decoration / backdrop parts
23:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> wow, pretty cool :)
23:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> have many more ides still number will increase ðŸ™‚
23:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> have many more ides still, expect numbers to increase ðŸ™‚
