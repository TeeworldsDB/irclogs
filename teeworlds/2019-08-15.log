00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @fokkonaut you leaked our secret trick :c
00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> traitor
00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xD
00:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> "I build shit by hand, like in the old days" that's the best line.
00:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> What secret trick :o? @ChillerDragon.
00:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @TeeSlayer, don't turn off your zCatch servers :( ppl play there. And those other servers are based on my zCatch mod, where someone took all the text messages, copy and pasted them into google translator and translated them into french and then created those servers.
00:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> There are even some english words mixed in there ._.
00:55 <@Dune> Huh
06:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @jxsl13 look at my issue
08:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Where does the server send the hook sound whenever we attach to a player, a solid block or hook an unhookable tile?
08:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> In 0.6 I remember we used the coreevent_hook_x and send the sounds from CCharacter
08:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Dont tell me this is not serverside anymore...
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> You can look at events in network.h
16:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @heinrich5991 it's called continous deployment (as far as I know), and yes your current services can do this but as far as i know you have to pay for it
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you can produce binary artifacts
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> and upload them somewhere
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @fokkonaut @Dune does the server send the sound or is it produced on client side?
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> The hook sounds are clientside, sadly
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @heinrich5991 do you mean by hand or by service?
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I thought the hook sounds for the local player were client side and all others were server side
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> since I can't compile for mac it would be a nice feature for teeworlds so i can produce and release mac binaries
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, you can do this with our existing CI services
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> do you have an example for teeworlds? Or do i have to write it myself? I think the teeworlds .yml files for CircleCI aren't very intuitive
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> very/any
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I haven't written them, but to me it looks like a sequence of commands being executed
16:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think circleci had a way of marking artifacts to be uploaded, I think you can check the ddnet config for this
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm. I'm being too negative
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> try out github actions, and if it works, feel free to PR it ðŸ™‚
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yeah I already registered for the beta
16:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> but I am still on the waiting list .___.
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Why does teeworlds not have an antiping btw? I see a lot of players complaining about it
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Like most features: because no one wrote one, probably
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I tried to look for 0.6 antiping code and didn't find anything clear
18:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @heinrich5991 could help there because ddrace has at least 2
18:31 < Oy> think there was a discussion about it long time ago. it couldn't be done properly, so it wasn't persued
18:54 <@Dune> @Assa I looked at the ddrace one and it looks like it uses some server-sided stuff too?
18:54 <@Dune> It seems there is a client-sided part but I found it kinda hard to isolate and understand
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i am reading some literature for this and it WILL introduce snapping
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is it still possible to make the Damage Indicator go into a specific direction or will they always fall down, and if too many go in a circle?
19:10 <@Dune> @fokkonaut : yeah you still send the angle afaik
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> No, a vec2 Source
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or wait
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> lol, you are right. One sec
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> :D
19:11 <@Dune> yeah I wrote that
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> here if anybody is interested: http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~claypool/courses/4513-B03/papers/games/bernier.pdf
19:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Dune: doesnt work when sending angle, does the client do something different? Because I am sending it like I would for 0.6
19:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> It just keeps spinning around of too many stars are at the same positions
19:20 <@Dune> ahh
19:20 <@Dune> you are right
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> So we cannot do that anymore?!
19:20 <@Dune> the computation of the angle is client-side now, so you can't :
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ...
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Are server messages a thing in 0.7?
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> in chat
19:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> sorry, of course :D
19:53 <@Dune> the `say` command is still there
19:53 <@Dune> but flag captures are now a special message iirc
19:53 <@Dune> so it can be translated client-side
19:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune is it easy to collect a frame/game state in teeworlds?
20:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> client prediction will be harder for joysticks
20:04 <@Dune> @Assa: no idea (and idk what you mean in particular)
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune does the server send one chunk of data for all entities or multiple packages?
20:11 <@Dune> not sure how the network part is done at all, never touched that
22:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the basics of prediction are simple
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> simulate for rrt
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and interpolate positions (if they don't differ to much)
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> but that means, that the client needs some server code to look where the other players are if their inputs don't change
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you already have something lika a prediction
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> search for intratick in client->player.cpp
22:25 <@Dune> @Assa try cl_predict 0 :)
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i see
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> why don't you do the same for projectiles?
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the code is there but commented out:
22:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> `//vec2 pos = mix(vec2(prev->x, prev->y), vec2(current->x, current->y), Client()->IntraGameTick());`
22:31 <@Dune> idk, try it
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> nethash ...
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> disable nethash :p
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> wip
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> heinrich made a nice commit
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But oy thought of another way and keeping the hash
22:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> (which just makes not really sense)
22:43 <@Dune> It was actually my initiative iirc: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2121
22:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2122
22:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> go along this
22:43 <@Dune> and there is an explanation why it makes sense to keep it :)
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i have a talent for breaking the nethash
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea right dune
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Its not hard to break it
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> If I would have not removed the check the mod I work on would break it 1000 times
22:46 <@Dune> yeah just remove it if you touch that part a lot
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Dune, what does this do?
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/0c338f0e00e21cd01c8f4eddc88fc831d855e068/src/game/server/gamecontroller.cpp#L363
22:48 <@Dune> I assume it is a method that is called on player info change :)
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yea, but there is nothing
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i just activated the intra tick and drew the normal grenade, the prev grenade, and the predicted one
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> there is just a 1 px difference
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so the intra tick  has nothing to do with the latency
22:50 <@Dune> yes, @fokkonaut, because this is an interface/abstract class
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Means
22:52 <@Dune> I'm not a programming book, look it up
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I mean, its empty, cant we remove it? Where do we call it?
22:59 <@Dune> https://www.google.com/search?q=abstract+methods
22:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Yea, butI didnt find the other declaration
23:01 <@Dune> new gamemodes (e.g. mods) might want to make use of that
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Ah
23:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i managed to do a very crappy grenade prediction
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> after shooting the grenade, the grenade is invisible for the latency time
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> then the grenade continues to fly through a wall (for latency time)
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and then the grenade explodes on the surface
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> but i can do rocket jumps with it
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Who is SNSnoop?
23:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Dune: Is it normal that you cant select Free-View in pause or spectator on some servers (custom mods)?
23:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Does the server do something wrong in those cases?
23:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> There is no Free-View button on the rshift menu
23:36 <@Dune> Survival mode probably
23:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Is it not possible there?
23:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I saw this happening on basically every custom mod
23:36 <@Dune> when you're dead, your camera locks afaik
23:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Do we need to send Gameflag Dead?
23:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oh lol
23:37 <@Dune> doesn't happen in race
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> For me it dors
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> does*
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> There is no FreeView button
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> No matter whether i send the dead flag or not
23:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> What is required to do this
