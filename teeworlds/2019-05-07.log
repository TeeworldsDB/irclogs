01:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I'm having a problem with TextWidth()
01:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> If my text is larger than linewidth, the cursor goes to a new line. Then it returns the cursor position at that new line
01:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> this means the width is wrong (it should return the width of the first line)
01:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> is there something I'm not seeing?
01:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> I tried with Cursor.m_Flags |= TEXTFLAG_STOP_AT_END; and Cursor.m_MaxLines = 1;
01:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> but in that case, TextEx() returns with the Cursor being at position 0
01:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> (if the text is larger than the m_LineWidth)
14:13 < Assa> hi
14:14 < Assa> any mod ideas now, since we have roboter skins? I think we can do great things with them
14:20 < Assa> i could easily throw robot waves at people, does anyone know the robot waves thing from tf2?
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> please keep the vanilla skill and dont mess it up with overpowered upgrades Assa
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> botwaves can be really fun but all 0.6 mods get really unskilled and boring after a few upgrades
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> If you want upgrades and a shop keep it simple. Only hp armor more weapon ammo/damge. No spreading that destroys vanilla aim or intensive bounce or insane fast shooting. Rather focus on a fun to fight enemy. Focus on nice bot movements.
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <n000b> Nice feedback chillerdagon
15:24 < Assa> @ChillerDragon: If you take a look at ZoD, you'll see, that I always keep the vanilla skill
15:24 < Assa> because you are right, super weapons are just boring
15:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I dont know ZoD sounds nice i will have a look.
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Hey btw what do you guys think of restricted confiurations.
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Currently it is possible to set sv_gametype to "foo" which is a bit weird.
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> \@ChillerDragon
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm i guess there is no nice way to ping from irc to discord just from discord to irc i guess.
15:53 < Dune> adding a @ often works @ChillerDragon, albeit not always
15:54 < Dune> not sure what it depends on
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it works from discord
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/575326365226893332/unknown.png
16:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> try sending this from irc: @ChillerDragon
16:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> grr this: \@ChillerDragon
16:24 < Dune> scroll up, you'll see instances where the @ simply works, like with Fudgy :)  it's a bit of a mystery
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i cant see pings from others .-.

16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh lol
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> do images even arrive in irc?
16:30 < Dune> don't you have an IRC client? you're logged in here
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i do xd
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but imo discord is more convient
16:31 < Dune> but you can answer that question by yourself
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i could sorri for being lazy
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> my vps password is sooo long -.-
16:33 < Dune> https://xkcd.com/936/ long easy passwords for the win :)
16:34 < Dune> @Fudgy: I think you can use Cursor.m_Flags |= TEXTFLAG_STOP_AT_END; instead of your hack
16:35 < Dune> if you look at the virtual void Text(...) function above TextWidth in text.cpp:506, it does just that
16:35 < Dune> 		if(!MultiLine)			Cursor.m_Flags |= TEXTFLAG_STOP_AT_END;
16:36 < Dune> @Fudgy

16:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> if it doesnt arrive in irc this makes no sense xd
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune my super long cryptig 10% random password is the only thing i remember in lyfe xd
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 100% random *

20:35 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 2 commits to branch master:
20:35 < Teeworlds>  • Dune-jr (c9423a6): Add a header guard to the stats component
20:35 < Teeworlds>  • oy (ba81835): Merge pull request #2133 from Dune-jr/fix-missing-guard…
23:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> @Dune "I tried with Cursor.m_Flags |= TEXTFLAG_STOP_AT_END; and Cursor.m_MaxLines = 1;
23:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> but in that case, TextEx() returns with the Cursor being at position 0"
23:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fudgy> so it returns a Width of 0, (Cursor.m_X is 0)
23:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Ah, I see
