12:20 < minus> oh, you found a 6 year old ticket, Dune
12:22 <@Dune> minus, oh, sorry for the ping :)
12:22 <@Dune> I asked myself the question recently and thought it might be time on decide on that
12:23 < minus> personally i prefer only upper casing the first letter, i.e. viewing acronyms as words. Go's style uses all uppercase acronyms
12:24 <@Dune> It's a bit more consistent I guess :) I got used to all uppercase by editing teeworlds code
12:24 < minus> considering it's mostly latter, just stick with that
12:24 <@Dune> yeah probably be good not to edit too much existing code :)
12:25 <@Dune> although that's still a lot
12:25 < minus> 30 isn't that much though?
12:26 <@Dune> I grepped with a ; to try to get declarations mostly
12:26 <@Dune> there is a lot of **** =
