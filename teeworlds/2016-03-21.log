20:07 < Darcidride> Hi, im a little server admin noob in Teeworlds and i want to know if we can monitoring the number of ingame players ? a file with 1 pseudo per line refresh every minutes for example, this will grant me the possibility to monitor it with my nagios/zabbix server (I want to publish publicly the graphs)
20:09 < Obani> heinrich5991 ?
20:12 <@heinrich5991> Obani?
20:12 < Obani> ^
20:12 < Obani> :p
20:13 <@heinrich5991> I'm not aware of any tool that does this by default
20:14 < Darcidride> well a self made script by the community or anything else which can help me in my task should be ok :)
20:14 < Darcidride> it's a littel curious that, nobody as never think about it :p
20:18 < Obani> Darcidride, https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/search.php
20:18 < Obani> At least we can do that for now
20:19 < Henningstone> what about this? https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11626
20:19 < Henningstone> it even creates the graphs on its own
20:20 < Obani> lol
20:20 < Obani> was about to send this
20:21 < Darcidride> oww !
20:22 < Darcidride> great tool ! but i prefer to centralize my monitoring inside my actual monitoring tool, but in this tool i think i can find some useful things, thank you i will investigate it
20:22 <@heinrich5991> echo -n $'\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xffgie3\xff' | nc -u -w 1 127.0.0.1 8303 | head -z -n 7 | tail -z -n 1 | tr '\0' '\n'
20:22 <@heinrich5991> this is what I quickly hacked together, it doesn't terminate correctly though
20:23 <@minus> Darcidride: are you already using nagios or zabbix?
20:23 < Obani> zabbix
20:23 < Darcidride> i already use zabbix yes
20:24 < Darcidride> zabbix is a fork of nagios
20:24 <@minus> no it's not
20:24 < Darcidride> i test your solution heinrich5991 
20:25 <@heinrich5991> as said, it doesn't terminate correctly
20:25 <@minus> should be possible to record metrics with zabbix easily. nagios can't record metrics (it's also very difficult to configure)
20:26 < Darcidride> i've also a sleeping shinken and a nagios instance, but i prefer Zabbix for my actual infrastrucutre
20:28 <@minus> sleeping shinken?
20:28 < Darcidride> stopped VM :)
20:28 <@minus> used to use zabbix, made the mistake of switching to icinga
20:28 < Darcidride> well, the point is i want to monitor the number of online players on my TW servers
20:28 <@minus> thought zabbix was bad, but icinga is just horrible
20:29 < Darcidride> ahah icinga, i turn around EON currently, i think i will try it soon :)
20:30 <@minus> turn around EON?
20:31 <@minus> i'm assuming you deal with sysadminning professionally?
20:32 < Darcidride> Eyes of Network, I think this monitoring tool have a great future
20:32  * minus takes a look
20:33 <@minus> oh, it builds ontop of or at least interfaces with nagios and cacti. seems decent
20:33 <@minus> much reporting
20:34 < Darcidride> im a "little" sysadmin, it's my hobby and i hope my future job, for now im just a student (Job alternately, didn't know if it's the good word in english, 50% of the time in a company, 50% of the time in a professionnal training school :))
20:35 < Darcidride> yes, the interfaces is great, i like the KISS inspirations
20:38 <@minus> i'll probably end up writing something for gathering monitoring data myself. haven't found a solution i find decently easy and comfortable to use :(
20:38 <@minus> goes into the category "that can't be so hard"
20:39 < Darcidride> dev alone a monitoring system ? based on nothing ? you're crazy =)
20:39 <@minus> just for personal use, and probably just the backend
20:39 <@minus> if i ever get to it™
20:40 < Darcidride> maybe a ELK stack can give you the "only" informations you need ?
20:41 <@minus> https://github.com/kahun/awesome-sysadmin#monitoring fyi
20:42 < Darcidride> what an interesting list of sysadmin tools !
20:42 < Darcidride> well, i still looking for a solution for my TW servers :D
20:45 < Darcidride> the player name connected to our server isn't stored somewhere ?
20:47 <@minus> nah, but you can query it
20:48 <@minus> you want more than just the player count?
20:48 < Darcidride> only the player count
20:48 <@minus> heinrich5991: what $ in your command is evaling \x? could also use echo -e in that case
20:48 <@minus> did heinrich5991's command not work?
20:49 <@heinrich5991> minus: yes, it is
20:49 <@minus> it's the simplest solution, but not perfect
20:49 < Darcidride> yes, it doesn't work
20:49 < Darcidride> i try to adapt it, but without success for the moment
20:49 <@heinrich5991> the program doesn't terminate though, no idea how to do that in netcat
20:49 <@minus> you'll need a program to query that stuff then.
20:49 <@minus> oh
20:49 <@minus> manpage should have info on that
20:50 <@minus> -q 1 might work
20:50 <@minus> (assuming openbsd netcat)
20:50 < Darcidride> debian netcat, hope it's the same =)
20:51 <@minus> well, debian either has gnu netcat or openbsd netcat (or even both) installed
20:51 <@minus> -w 1 maybe
20:51 < Darcidride> can you give the entire command line to me please ?
20:52 < Darcidride> netcat isn't my cup of tea
20:52 <@minus> oh, heinrich5991 already had -w 1 in there
20:53 <@minus> well, you can easily write a little C/Python/PHP/Ruby/Perl program to do the work
20:54 < Darcidride> why not a bash script ?
20:54 < Darcidride> it's just one line =)
20:54 < Darcidride> (if it works)
20:54 <@minus> because it has to deal with binary data, a udp socket and it has to exit after the first response
20:55 <@minus> probably doable in bash, but bash sucks
20:56 < Darcidride> unfortunaly, i don't think it's the skills to do it in python, i will check it later
20:56 < Darcidride> i've the skills*
20:57 <@minus> echo -n $'\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xffgie3\xff' | nc -u -w 1 -q 1 127.0.0.1 8303 | head -z -n 7 | tail -z -n 1 | tr '\0' '\n' ← this actually works (added -q 1 so it quits if the server is not responding, but doesn't print anything)
20:58 < rand> neat.
21:00 < Darcidride> i look the bsd man of tail, and my linux tail and i didn't see the -z option, what's that ?
21:00 < Darcidride> (tail and head)
21:09 < rand> -z, --zero-terminated line delimiter is NUL, not newline
21:15 <@minus> Darcidride: https://sr.ht/kj7s.py
21:17 < Darcidride> wow minus, awesome ! :p
21:19 <@minus> works with py2 too btw
21:25 <@heinrich5991> minus: only with from __future__ import print_function, right?
21:27 <@minus> nope
21:27 <@minus> () is interpreted as normal brackets
21:27 <@minus> if you have a comma in there it will print as a tuple tho
21:28 < Darcidride> minus, i should be good if you post this on the forum
21:28 <@minus> hm?
21:30 < Darcidride> if you post your little python script on the TW forum, nothing will be lost, and people will be grateful
21:31 <@minus> eh, doesn't matter, it's easily written again
21:31 < Darcidride> it's not easy re-written for everyone, it's just what i mean :)
21:33 < Darcidride> easily re-writtable*
21:33 <@minus> well, there's a more complete project here: https://git.mnus.de/minus/teeworlds_srvbrowse
21:34 <@minus> feel free to post it somewhere though, i'm putting it in the public domain (if that even applies to such a short script)
21:35 <@heinrich5991> minus: print("usage: {} HOST PORT".format(sys.argv[0], file=sys.stderr))
21:35 <@heinrich5991> it only works in python 2 because you made an error :)
21:38 <@minus> oh.
21:38 <@heinrich5991> the parantheses aren't correct
21:38 <@minus> yeah
21:38 <@minus> https://sr.ht/Io8C.py there
21:38 <@minus> fixed
21:38 <@minus> i hope you're happy now
21:42 < nameless_tee40> hey everybody!
21:42 < nameless_tee40> wassup! 
21:43 <@minus> greetings
21:43 < nameless_tee40> wow, my name is nameless( sad
21:44 < nameless_tee40> should change
21:45 < nameless_tee40> hm...... how I can do thi.....
21:45 <@minus> /nick nameless_tee41
21:45 <@heinrich5991> can you be this new to IRC when you are logged into Q? :)
21:57 < stanrud> hey
21:57 < stanrud> yeahhh
21:58 < stanrud> changed it)
