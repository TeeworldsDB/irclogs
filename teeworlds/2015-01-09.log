02:53 < JulianAssange> there hasn't been a topic for weeks
18:05 < Peasant65> hi ! I've been here some time ago with the problem that my teeworlds servers keep crashing with a segmentation fault 
18:06 < Peasant65> I have tried the python patcher and I have compiled from source
18:06 < Peasant65> atm i'm running mostly openfng servers 
18:06 < Peasant65> can anyone help me ?
18:06 < Peasant65> I'm on ubuntu server 64bit
18:17 < heinrich5991> Peasant65: the script might not be able to patch openfng servers
18:17 < heinrich5991> but I think fstd provided a fix for openfng?
18:17 < heinrich5991> fstd: are you here?
18:23 < Peasant65> yes I think he did I did compile freshly uploaded/dated code but it keeps crashing 
18:24 < Peasant65> It seems to crash more often when a lot of people are playing (and never when it's empty)
18:24 <@minus> let it drop coredumps and check those
18:25 <@minus> i have no idea what the conditions for coredumps to be generated are, systemd seems to do fancy stuff with that too
18:26 < Peasant65> how do I do that ?
18:26 < Peasant65> and what are coredumps ?
19:09 < BotoX> compile it in debug mode (bam server_debug)
19:09 < BotoX> and run the binary with gdb
19:09 < BotoX> gdb ./teeworlds_srv_d
19:09 < BotoX> run
19:09 < BotoX> and wait until it crashes
19:09 < BotoX> then type backtrace
19:09 < BotoX> and paste it somewhere
21:23 < fstd> inb4 it's the wrong branch
21:23 < fstd> heinrich5991: wassup
21:36 < fstd> Peasant65
21:36 < Peasant65> yes ?
21:36 < fstd> i wrote OpenFNG
21:36 < fstd> what's the issue?
21:37 < Peasant65> It's giving me segmentation fault errors 
21:37 < EastByte> all your base belongs to fstd 
21:37 < EastByte> hi fstd 
21:37 < fstd> hey there, long time no see
21:37 < fstd> Peasant65: that related to the 'server crasher' which goes around?
21:38 < fstd> the other day i pulled heinrich5991's fix to the openfng_fixed_0_6 branch
21:38 < fstd> if you build that, you should be good
21:39 < Peasant65> I did build that (if i recall correctly he updated it just 2 minutes before i compiled it) 
21:40 < fstd> he?
21:40 < Peasant65> she ? heinrich5991 
21:40 <@minus> looking for a CSS hero, anyone up to do some design fixes on discourse to make it teeish?
21:41 < fstd> Peasant65: heinrich5991's a he, but i don't understand how he's related to the matter (other than by being the upstream wrt. to the fix)
21:42 < Peasant65> he said the edit he made would fix my crashes 
21:42 < Peasant65> but it didn't
21:42 < fstd> do you have my openfng_fixed_0_6 branch checked out?
21:45 < fstd> Peasant65: well let me know me when you are more cooperative :)
21:46 < Peasant65> fstd: sorry in about 10 minutes is that ok with you ? I was watching a serie :( 
21:47 < fstd> okay, no worries
21:49 < Peasant65> fstd: now i'm here 
21:49 < fstd> okay. are you familiar with git?
21:50 < fstd> actually, let's take this to #openfng
22:50 < TheDerero> minus: I could try.
