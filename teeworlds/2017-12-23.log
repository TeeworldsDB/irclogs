14:46 < fstd_> matricks: hey, long time no read.  i've got a question regarding tee physics, specifically about the velocity ramp curvature; can you explain the idea behind it?
14:46 < fstd_> and was it ever intended that (further) accelerating a fast-going tee would actually slow it down?
14:56 < fstd_> i.e. is this - i think it is a - bug actually something that was done intentionally? http://penenen.de/demo_2017-12-23_14-51-46.demo
14:56 < fstd_> (map is http://penenen.de/Nicktee_Lauda.map )
14:58 < fstd_> (if the velramp curvature is straight, i.e. 1.0, then it behaves newton-ish)
15:01 < fstd_> i think the idea might have been to introduce sort of a tw-speed of light that you can only ever get so close to, but it actually slowing down to a standstill... mh.  doesn't strike me as intended :-)
15:35 <@matricks> fstd_:  the velramp was put there to dampen out high speeds because it could get rediclous, you can think of it as air resistance
15:35 <@matricks> i cant check video or maps etc
15:35 <@matricks> in Colombia at the moment
18:00 < fstd_> matricks: okay then i guess it's in fact a bug/unintended consequence; thanks for the info
18:06 < fstd_> eeeee: can teewebs play demos?
