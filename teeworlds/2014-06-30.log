06:24 < wvjoker> hello
17:30 < swick> can someone tell me why is GetVideoModes threaded?
17:31 < swick> …but things like Minimize are not?
17:39 < heinrich5991> swick: I don't know who implemented threaded rendering
17:41 < swick> mh, whatever. I'm not going to make GetNumScreens threaded.
17:41 < heinrich5991> swick: you implemented multi-monitor support?
17:41 < swick> yes
17:42 < heinrich5991> great!
17:42 < swick> reimplementing it now, based on the new sdl2 branch
17:43 < heinrich5991> swick: do you know waht cinaera ment with that? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1246#discussion-diff-14331121
17:44 < swick> heinrich5991: I know what it does but I don't know why it's needed on windows
17:45 < swick> heinrich5991: removed it by accident anyway
17:45 < spok_loh> я лох
17:48 < BotoX> xaxaxaxaxa
17:48 < PsychoGod> D:
17:49 < spok_loh> привет ботокс
17:50 < BotoX> hello mate
17:50 < heinrich5991> spok_loh: this is an english channel, I guess most here don't understand you
17:50 < BotoX> >2014
17:50 < spok_loh> sorry for me
17:50 < BotoX> >not understanding russian
18:03 < swick> so anyone in here who can test this https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1246 on windows and/or mac osx?
18:09 < PsychoGod> struct concept_empty {      template<typename T> static void check(T &t) { if(0) t.empty(); }; };
18:09 < PsychoGod> what is if(o) using for ? D:
18:11 <@minus> it's if(0)
18:11 < PsychoGod> if it's if(0) then it always = true ? D: so why you need this ?
18:12 < EastByte> ^ it's not
18:12 <@minus> always false
18:12 < heinrich5991> probably debug code
18:12 <@minus> you usually do that to make the compiler remove code when using macros
18:13 < heinrich5991> nothing is wrong with false though
18:13 < heinrich5991> (except in C)
18:14 <@minus> huh"
18:14 <@minus> huh?
18:15 < PsychoGod> but here in base/tl/range.h there are struct's that have functions in each of them there is if(0) somefunc();   so this somefunc doesn't load at all ? D:
18:18 < heinrich5991> minus: in C++ you could use false
18:18 <@minus> 500% longer
18:18 <@minus> 400 actually but you get the idea
18:20 < heinrich5991> yes :)
18:20 < heinrich5991> minus: btw, have you looked into rust already?
18:20 <@minus> i have looked into me not having time
18:20 <@minus> and other things to do
18:20 < heinrich5991> hehe
18:21 <@minus> like writing a mail address admin interface
18:21 < PsychoGod> ah, man, i don't understand anything xDDD can you explain? what macros ? why if(0) ?
18:21 <@minus> and work, ofc
18:21 <@minus> PsychoGod: well, to summarize: black compiler magic
18:21 <@minus> i guess
18:21 <@minus> we do not know either
18:22 <@minus> matricks probably knows what those if(0) in base/tl/range.h are for
18:24 < heinrich5991> those are type bounds I think
18:24 < heinrich5991> PsychoGod: ^
18:25 < heinrich5991> if you have concept_empty::check(x) in template code
18:25 < heinrich5991> you know that x has a method empty()
18:25 < heinrich5991> minus: ^
18:26 < PsychoGod> http://ft.trillian.im/f70a98cf8069509b94b68be0bf6d9f6a9f52c7be/6qILNyt0thJfF6w6Dqtz9geZcfO49.jpg
18:27 < PsychoGod> wtf ? D: if(0)
18:27 < heinrich5991> PsychoGod: you shouldn't save screenshots as jpg, rather use png
18:28 < heinrich5991> I tried to explain it
18:28 < heinrich5991> if you invoke concept_empty::check(x)
18:28 < heinrich5991> on an x in template
18:29 < PsychoGod> if(0) identical if(t!=0) ?
18:29 < heinrich5991> you know that it has a check method
18:29 < heinrich5991> no
18:29 < heinrich5991> if(0) means the code will not be evaluated
18:29 < heinrich5991> it's a noop function during runtime
18:29 < heinrich5991> it's used at compile time for type chcking
18:34 < PsychoGod> ok, i think i understand, it just check has that template this function or not, right ?
18:35 < heinrich5991> there are two verbs in your sentence
18:35 < heinrich5991> I don't understand it, can you rephrase it?
18:36 < PsychoGod> it check if variable of that template has function that used after if(0) ?
18:42 <@minus> heinrich5991: templates are duck typing for C++
18:42 < heinrich5991> duck typing at compile time
18:43  * minus quacks
18:43 < PsychoGod> xD
19:05  * PsychoGod quack quack
19:36 < PsychoGod> bool operator ==(const vector2_base &v) const { return x == v.x && y == v.y; } //TODO: do this with an eps instead  bad in english, what meens "with an eps" ?
19:36 <@minus> good question
19:37 < heinrich5991> PsychoGod: epsilon
19:37 < heinrich5991> whcih means that he wants a fuzzy compare
19:37 < heinrich5991> like
19:38 < heinrich5991> abs(x - v.x) < 0.0001
19:38 < heinrich5991> (just better)
19:52 < PsychoGod> why not to floor(f_temp * 1000.0f)/1000.0f ?
19:52 < PsychoGod> easiest way
20:01 < Matodor> PsychoGod hello :)
20:02 < PsychoGod> i don't know you D:
20:02 < Matodor> you lie
20:03 < PsychoGod> you lie that lie I
20:03 < Matodor> you lie that's i lie that you lie
20:08 < PsychoGod> double ceil(double v, int p) {   v *= pow(10, p);   v = ceil(v);   v /= pow(10, p); }
20:11 < PsychoGod> http://ft.trillian.im/f70a98cf8069509b94b68be0bf6d9f6a9f52c7be/6qISFCcBwtHD8PfWiyGHgL6zN2R8O.jpg
20:11 < PsychoGod> found something
21:18 < BeaR_> swick: fullscreen mode works at windows
21:26 < swick> \o/
21:27 < swick> now we only have to deal with windows not wanting to create a window with the correct size
21:27 < BeaR_> tested that windowed bug with my own framework, same issue, boils down to what window style it uses ..
21:28 < BeaR_> Fetching the actual window size after creation should fix this
21:29 < swick> yeah, adding SDL_GetWindowSize(m_pWindow, Width, Height); after window creation doesn't seem to affect proper systems
21:29 < swick> if you could test if it fixes the bug that would be great
21:30 < BeaR_> Yeah, clipping is correct now
21:31 < swick> greating, pushing now
21:32 < BeaR_> nice (:
22:06 < PsychoGod> guys, i'm fired my brain
22:06 < PsychoGod> what means do{}while(0) ? XD
22:06 <@minus> lrn2C
22:07 < BotoX> >do {} while(0);
22:07 < PsychoGod> it runs 1 time, so why need cycle ?
22:07 < BotoX> wow, I don't even
22:07 < BotoX> I don't understand it either why you would wanna do that
22:07 < PsychoGod> i'm not, check system.h str_utf8_decode func
22:07 < BotoX> maybe to use break;
22:08 < BotoX> ya, to use break I guess, lol
22:08 < PsychoGod> loled too
22:09 <@minus> why use break
22:09 <@minus> when you can use goto
22:09  * minus rushes off
22:09 < PsychoGod> yeah, it's strange
22:09 < BotoX> Is there any advantage in doing that?
22:10 < PsychoGod> nope xD
22:10 <@minus> BotoX: yozakura quartet: hana no uta BDs. go getthem while they're fresh!
22:10 < BotoX> not watching anything right now :(
22:10 < BotoX> Not in the mood for animu lately
22:11 < BotoX> coalgirls pls finish monogatari 2, I guess I would wanna watch that
22:20 <@matricks> PsychoGod: the if(0) is there to make sure that the code doesn't run
22:21 < PsychoGod> omg, and what it is for in this structs ? D:
22:21 <@matricks> PsychoGod: to make sure that the templated argument has a function called empty
22:23 < PsychoGod> ok, thx ;)
