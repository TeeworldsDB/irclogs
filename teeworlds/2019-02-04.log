17:36 <@Dune> o/
17:36 <@Dune> still haven't solved the mystery of those steam guys that get a runtime error even with teeworlds.com downloads btw https://steamcommunity.com/app/380840/discussions/0/1743355067134127472/
17:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> msvc redistribuables?
17:53 < Oy> probably some broken installation
17:54 < day> does the pistol reload in 0.6 behave different in anyway from 0.7? (due to bugs or w/e)?
17:54 < day> differently*
17:55 < Oy> day: yeah
17:55 < day> oh, really? how does it differ?
18:02 < Oy> pistol has to be the selected weapon to regenerate ammo, in the past it just had to be for a small part of a second which could be abused
18:03 < day> wtf really?
18:03 < day> i guess i didnt know that abuse trick and thought it wouldnt reload in the background like it does today
18:03 <@Dune> I doubt anyone really abused that though, it's not easy
18:03 < day> dunno i talked about it with magnet yesterday and he mentioned it/ prefered the bug
18:04 <@Dune> I could be wrong then
18:04 < day> so you switch to the pistol and then back and it keeps reloading in the background?
18:04 < day> doesnt sound too difficult
18:05 <@Dune> but what do you mean by "thought it wouldnt reload in the background like it does today"? it doesn't reload in the background today?
18:05 < day> well like it behaves today
18:05 < day> bad wording
18:06 < day> so i guess it was always the same, except there used to be a bug that lets you circumvent the restriction
18:06 < rand> in the past, does it reload 1 ammo when switching or does it reload the whole magazine while using another weapons ? (using this trick/bug)
18:06 < Oy> well, you could automatically do it with a modified client, so u wouldn't have noticed while playing
18:07 < Oy> 1 ammo
18:07 < day> ah
18:07 < day> so theres like a frame check
18:07 < Oy> tick on the server
18:08 < day> if the weapon is out during each currentframe % Integer it reloads one?
18:08 < rand> I did observed that I get more often without ammo than before, dunno if I change my play or if this is caused by this change
18:08 < rand> since I often switch weapon, it might be linked
18:09 < rand> I might have abused this without knowing it xD
18:09 < day> in 0.7 it supposedly is fixed. (assuming we are still talking about the same bug)
18:10 < Oy> when the cooldown was over it checked if it's the current weapon and increases ammo by one - just need to be the active weapon for that check
18:10 < day> i also want weaponswitching cooldowns not to be linked to weapon fire cooldowns :p
18:11 < day> and weapons shouldnt share cooldowns either
18:11 < day> imagine the hell you could unleash in a blink of an eye ^.^
18:12 < Oy> :P
18:12 < day> btw. any lifesigns from matricks?
18:13 <@Dune> yes, he updated bam not long ago :)
18:13 < day> nice
18:47 <@Dune> hello minus
18:47 <@Dune> would you rename Support at header_t.html:156 to Docs, along with the PR https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/pull/29
18:48 <@Dune> everything else should be fine, given that non-existing pages redirect to help.html
18:49 <@Dune> (docs_overview.html was merged into help.html and deleted, should now redirect to help.html)
18:53 < day> Dune: is 'There is loads of people...' actually correct? I know it is informal, but seeing that it is plural shouldn't it be 'There are loads..'?
18:53 < day> saw that in the git pull request, to give some context 
18:55 < Oy> yeah, should be 'are
18:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It always looks off to me, but I didn't write that so I left it
18:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Ah :)
18:59 < minus> Dune: done
19:01 < Oy> \o/
20:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how do i convert a integer to string in tw style?
20:15 < Learath2> str_toint?
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> where is it defined? o.O
20:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah system.h
20:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i was searching for this in system.h i am blind -.-
20:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ty Learath2
20:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its just using atioi xd
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> int str_toint(const char *str) { return atoi(str); }
20:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah wait its the other wy around -.-
20:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> there is atio() but no itoa()?
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> just do str_format(..., '"%d",...)
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> just do str_format(..., "%d",...)
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hmm was thinking about it
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but i thought there must be a better way that dynamically allocates the exact amount of memory
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> malloc(sizeof(char)*(int)log10(num))
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8257714/how-to-convert-an-int-to-string-in-c#8257728
20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is str_format overflow save?
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> you specify the size of the buffer as the 2nd parameter
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> tru
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> brain was off xd
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> as always
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ya i guess it is fine because you mostly know the maximum size of the numbers
