19:45 < Oy> hey
19:47 <@Dune> hey
20:07 <@Dune> minus: since members are limited to 2MB per attachment, are we not set up storage wise for attachments for everyone? would help with tutorial pics
20:24 < minus> Dune: members can't upload files
20:24 <@Dune> yeah, I mean they're limited to 2MB by default
20:25 < minus> We don't have a proper storage, no
20:25 <@Dune> ok
20:27 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1932 can be closed?
20:27 <@Dune> yes
20:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Mice> What about an option to connect to google drive?
20:29 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1960 doubt that's it working and not sure what's it's actually building cause bam doesn't support it
20:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Mice> So people store their own attachments, google drive has big space
20:30 < Oy> guess it builds the 32bit arm version
20:30 < Oy> otherwise the build would have failed
20:37 <@Dune> alright, then it should be removed downstream
20:44 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1625 and https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1881 : close?
20:44 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1827 has a milestone but no tags
20:49 < Oy> closed the 2
20:50 < Oy> wanted to do sth for the 3rd, have to think what it was
20:54 < Oy> did we decline https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1615 in the meeting?
20:54 <@Dune> kinda iirc
20:54 <@Dune> have to look the log
20:54 <@Dune> @LordSk remember?
20:55 < Oy> think we talked about it
20:55 <@Dune> I remember a slight static zoomout was suggested due to modern resolutions
20:55 <@Dune> yeah we did
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah we said no
20:56 <@Dune> that's when https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1922 came out (magnet)
20:57 < Oy> then i'll close it?
20:58 <@Dune> yeah, rejected by collegiate decision
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> did we make an issue for the bot implementation yet?
20:59 <@Dune> no
21:07 < Oy> ok
21:07 < Oy> probably some more issues missing?
21:08 <@Dune> yeah, there's work
21:13 <@Dune> I wonder what happens after a tick overflow
21:13 < Oy> game should be f*** up for connected players
21:14 < Oy> think i simulated it years ago
21:15 <@Dune> oh, Zwelf made the PR \o/
21:15 <@Dune> paste, finally
21:16 <@Dune> should make a feature preview as a small blog post once all text input changes are in :)
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> @Oy: We are nearly done with domination (port + some new things and many changes).
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> You can find all information here: https://github.com/teeworlds-domination/domination
22:18 <@Dune> by the way, I get 413 Request Entity Too Large whenever I upload anything sizeable via the attachments :/ I suspect admins inherit from the 2MB limit of members. didn't manage to change it via the interface
22:18 <@Dune> any clue, minus? trying to save some data
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> If you are not satisfied with the credits, please let me know.
22:19 <@Dune> will you publish the mod on teeworlds.com? :)
22:19 < Oy> they are fine ;)
22:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> We are only waiting for zatlines artwork and sonix map rework. Then we will publish it.
22:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Alright, ty Oy!
22:21 < Oy> do u use the white flag too?
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> I didn't change the flag animation, yes we use the white flag.
22:23 < Oy> ok, good :)
22:24 < Oy> think aQua did the old dom mapres
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Should I add credits for the mapres, or was it just some side note? ðŸ˜ƒ
22:31 < Oy> dunno
22:32 < Oy> he was a great guy, doubt he would mind
22:32 <@Dune> can't find him on the forums
22:32 < Oy> nfd tee was the nick i think
22:33 <@Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/profile.php?id=1492 correct

22:34 <@Dune> ho :0
22:35 <@Dune> not very teeish :D
22:35 < minus> Dune: probably a missing nginx setting
22:35  * Dune googles nginx
22:36 < minus> You should sysadmin more
22:36 < minus> Nginx is something one should know
22:36 <@Dune> never had the opportunity. time to learn :)
