22:39 < lamefun> Is it intentional that when you click both mouse buttons at the same time, nothing happens, or is something up with my input?
22:45 < Edible> something is up with your input
22:46 < Edible> i have the hook,shoot & jump all on b1 b2 and b3, it all works fine
22:46 < Edible> well, i used to until that style of play screwed everything up
22:47 < Edible> and by everything i mean the mouse, lifetime of 10 months or so
22:47 < Edible> you on linux lamefun ?
22:48 < Edible> fedora
22:48 < Edible> ah
22:48 < Edible> i see
22:48 < Edible> you shouldnt use linux
22:48 < Edible> its bad for your sanity
22:48 <@heinrich5991> </3
22:56 < yemDX> teeworlds dead yet
22:57 <@heinrich5991> maybe?
22:57 < yemDX> dang
22:57 <@heinrich5991> 500 players online right now
22:57 < yemDX> checked github and saw last commit was 4 months ago
22:58 < yemDX> had to see if yall died
22:58 <@heinrich5991> 70 in standard game types
22:58 <@heinrich5991> development of vanilla is *very* slow
22:59 < lamefun> is client-side scripting planned?
22:59 < yemDX> has been for a few years now 
22:59 < yemDX> i just check every few months to see if yall still remember it
22:59 <@heinrich5991> lamefun: at the current rate the better question would be: is a release in this decade planned
23:00 < Edible> oh look its yem
23:00 < Edible> hi yem
23:00 < yemDX> heya
23:00 < lamefun> is there anything left to develop even?
23:00 < Edible> i thought you retired or something
23:01 < yemDX> well when there's no one decent to play with you're sort of forced to retire
23:01 < yemDX> and i dont like ddrace
23:01 < yemDX> or ctf5
23:01 < lamefun> as far as I can see the game is complete
23:01 <@heinrich5991> yemDX: there's a ctf2 thing going on right now
23:01 <@heinrich5991> lamefun: some security fixes might be nice
23:02 < yemDX> i think there's plenty to add
23:02 < yemDX> or rather change
23:02 < Edible> yemDX, there used to be like weekly games on ictf and so on, so.
23:02 < yemDX> wouldn't mind some qol UI stuff
23:03 < yemDX> i dont really care for mods man
23:03 <@heinrich5991> 0.7 would have a completely different UI ^^
23:04 < Edible> zcatch*
23:04 < lamefun> mods are spirituall life of a game...
23:04 < yemDX> there's at least a ctf game once a month in brazil from what i've seen
23:04 < Edible> theres some people that don't play ctf5 at night, every day
23:04 < yemDX> i get invited to them occasionally from the discord
23:04 < yemDX> mods are cool and all but i dont like the mods people like on teeworlds
23:05 < yemDX> instagib's about as fun as it is on quake
23:05 < yemDX> is the whole skin revamp thing still in 0.7
23:06 <@heinrich5991> yes
23:06 < yemDX> i tried it out a looong time ago when it got first added, was kinda cool
23:06 < yemDX> i want that stuff from tw-pandora to get added if you remember that
23:07 < yemDX> at least the skid thing and the dust physics
