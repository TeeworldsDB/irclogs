11:58 < JulianAssange> matricks: you worked on wolfenstein 
11:59 < JulianAssange> does the xbox versoin allow you to play the original?
11:59 <@matricks> none of them allows it, it's just the first map done as an easter egg.. 
11:59 <@matricks> aka, the nightmare level
12:00 < JulianAssange> hm ok
16:17  * holymadtee slaps fstd around a bit with a large fishbot
16:18 <@minus> domestic violence is no good, holymadtee
16:49 < JulianAssange> telag.ne is a norway isp
16:49 < JulianAssange> so it would be international violence
17:02 < JulianAssange> if an apple falls from a tree planted in russia, into a field in Ukraine, is the apple ukrainian or russian?
17:02 < JulianAssange> just kidding, russia would annex the field to reclai it :)
17:06  * JulianAssange slaps holymadtee around a bit with a large fishbot
17:10 < holymadtee> Hey ^^
17:10  * foxlet peeks in.
17:14 < fstd> holymadtee?
17:17 < holymadtee> yes?
17:17 < JulianAssange> 17:17  * holymadtee slaps fstd around a bit with a large fishbot
17:18 < JulianAssange> he's probably wondering what that wqas about
17:18 < holymadtee> a missclick on my part :p
17:19 < fstd> fair enough
17:20 < holymadtee> Though i was wondering if anyone would be willing to host a fng server
17:21 < JulianAssange> in which country
17:21 < fstd> on whose server?
17:21 < holymadtee> central europe
17:21 < holymadtee> around germany
17:23 < JulianAssange> can't help
17:24 < holymadtee> Thanks for trying ^^
17:26 < holymadtee> Need a server up to host my maps ^
17:28 < JulianAssange> why not ask somebody that already hosts, to add your map?
17:29 < holymadtee> Some of them are on online servers
17:30 < holymadtee> Would be nice to have a server for my clan aswell
17:32 < foxlet> I got servers, but in the US.
17:33 < holymadtee> Us is a bit faraway, britain, france, germany would be allright
17:43 < JulianAssange> anybody here ever used doxygen?
17:45 < fstd> yes
17:45 < JulianAssange> is it nice?
17:45 < JulianAssange> or is it better just to comment the functions
17:45 < fstd> IMO it's tedious, but if you write your project with doxygen in mind from the start, then it can be fairly useful
17:45 < CookieMichal> Hey, Can anyone help me? Someone uses my name, what should I do?
17:46 < fstd> CookieMichal: use a different name
17:47 < JulianAssange> oh
17:47 < JulianAssange> this doxygen expects comments as they are usually done in java
17:52 < fstd_> i guess doxygen is older than javadoc, but yeah the idea is the same
