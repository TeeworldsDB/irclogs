01:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> logfiles killing the server makes debugging of e.g. servers started via systemd harder.
11:56 < Robyt3> hey, @heinrich5991 online?
11:57 < Robyt3> the jsonwriter doesn't write unicode correctly anymore
11:58 < Robyt3> any umlaut is just written as \uffff
12:34 < Dune> hey Robyt3
12:34 < Dune> heinrich5991 is off as far as I can tell
12:43 < Dune> is EscapeJsonChar the culprit?
12:50 < Robyt3> Probably something to do with line 152: str_format(aStr, sizeof(aStr), "\\u%04x", pStr[i]);
12:50 < Robyt3> Not sure how that format string works, but I think putting the char in there is not correct
12:51 < Robyt3> It shouldn't even try to escape a utf8 char really
12:51 < Robyt3> because utf8 is required for json
12:52 < Robyt3> So NeedsEscape becomes true even thou it should't escape anything
13:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> form spam o.O
13:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol, when chillerdragon reports it, the spam must be massive :D
13:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no ðŸ˜„ its just a message i just did my montly forum visit and saw it
17:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> btw what was the command to list server maps
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> there is none
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> you can TAB autocomplete to cycle through them while entereing sv_map in the rcon console
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> what do you mean there is none, i remember there was a pr that got merged related to that
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/bc38f677506bb0244e4c3f986332f9bb72a8c4b9
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1086
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> as i said
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> enter sv_map and then start pressing TAB
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it will cycle through the list of maps
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> like name autocompletion
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> there is no graphically list
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> thats bs
17:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> did Oy forget to merge this commit from that pr? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1086/commits/0ac65bcca9d09274adb86274d4cd4e55d9a265fd
17:46 < Oy> no, didn't add that on purpose
17:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> why ðŸ˜¦
17:47 < Oy> what do u need it for?
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> to not minimize and browser data folder
17:49 < Oy> use the auto-completion to search?
17:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> thats alot of tabbing
17:51 < Oy> type in part of it and then complete?
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> with the list i might rediscover some forgotten ones
17:53 < Oy> the client knows all the maps, so could add a map list to the console info box, but dunno if that would help as not many are listed there
17:54 < Oy> open an issue, sth will be done then :P
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> would it be possible to auto create a vote list?
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> listing maps
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> for each map in folder add vote "Switch to .map"
17:58 < Oy> had that in mind for https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2242#issuecomment-534635674
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> ooh nice, forgot about that
