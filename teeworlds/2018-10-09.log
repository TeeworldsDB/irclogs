06:56 < burt> oh boy
06:56 < burt> the botnet is back
06:56 < burt> and every server is full
06:57 < burt> not like anybody even bothers to develop teeworlds anymore
06:57 < burt> >last commit 10 months ago
06:57 < burt> lmao
08:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> Huh?
14:10 < lvgx> some servers are unaffected
14:11 < lvgx> idk if they managed to block the attack or if they are the attackers ^^
14:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ZeloAvarosa> botnet?
15:15 < rand> looks like the attacker changed its attack 
15:15 < rand> or the attack are less frequent allowing player to join
15:17 < rand> (or, its my ddnet client that makes me think that way, not counting (connecting) client and wait for a slot, ignoring "Full" messages)
15:30 < lvgx> some servers just don't have any "(connecting)" client listed and just work as usual
