17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> possible potential for vacnet equivalent?
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> detecting bots/sending demos and having something like a teeworlds overwatch
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> It _would_ work, but will never happen
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> really big and barely useful, teeworlds does not require login/accounts
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <1stDecadeTW> Gameplay stats, and maybe, "skill progress" could be saved using user accounts
20:21 < Learath2> We have a more efficient format to save every action on a ddnet server, the idea is to post process the files to detect bots and fishy runs, but no one really worked on using it yet
20:21 < Learath2> we can craft crude teeworlds demos from teehistorian files though, which helps audit runs that are reported to be fishy
20:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Makes more sense on a more centralized  network like ddnet where you can ban ppl
20:32 < Learath2> The idea is more to keep the leaderboards clean, not like we can enforce bans either
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Ah I see
21:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> teehistorion is highly efficient and should be ported and maybe added to vanilla
21:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe add an iotion to manually classify players as bots.
21:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Option
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> What is that?
22:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that is the user input etc. logging format of ddrace.
23:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> forum.
