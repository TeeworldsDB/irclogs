02:06 < Stitch626> aha, a wild fistmas appeared.
13:01 < Obani> why is teeworlds 0.6.4 not abled to compile with bam 5 ?
13:02 < Henningstone> nobody added support for that
13:02 < Obani> I mean I still could compile it with bam 5 aplying the commit from master
13:02 < Obani> Henningstone, the realease was posted after the commit for bam 5 support was commited
13:02 < Obani> release*
13:02 < Henningstone> ye but the master-branch is 0.7
13:03 < Obani> Yes but
13:03 < Obani> 0.6.4 is a release out from 0.7 branch
13:04 < Obani> With some little commits
13:04 < Obani> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/d6f3cc159257a2d6033e3ef46906c72c9db1b9eb
13:04 < Henningstone> Still, this is where 0.6.4 came from: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commits/0.6
13:04 < Henningstone> No such commit there
13:04 <@minus> 0.6.4 is not from the 0.7 branch, it's from 0.6.3 of course
13:05 < Obani> You don't understand
13:05 < Obani> You're still in the error :p
13:05 < Obani> The repo is the same, you would have needed to put the commit in both branches
13:05 < Obani> No reason to only put it on master branch
13:06 < Obani> As bam 4 is not available anymore (on Github at least)
13:06 <@minus> https://matricks.github.io/bam/
13:07 <@minus> but yeah, no branch/tag for 0.4 on github
13:07 < Obani> where is this link ?
13:07 < Obani> In docs or anywhere ?
13:07 < Obani> Ok it's in the title lol
13:07 <@minus> in the project description on github
13:07 < Obani> Actually
13:08 < Obani> The website is outdated
13:08 <@minus> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
13:08 < Obani> isn't it matricks ?
13:08 < Obani> #ping
13:10 < koomi> most distros still package 0.4
13:10 < Obani> wait
13:10 < Obani> bam is a package ?
13:10 <@minus> of course
13:10 < Obani> damn
13:10 < Obani> I always compiled it from source
13:11 < Obani> Well anyway now it is compiled...
14:34 <@heinrich5991> we could make it compatible with bam 0.4 and 0.5
18:37 < Stitch626> nub :D
