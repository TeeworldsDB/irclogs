17:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> Can I ask a stupid question: Why is the netcode generated in Teeworlds. Why don't we have it as fixed files? I was thinking about that for a long time and I don't find any reasons
17:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> so you can modify a human-readable protocol in the python files I suppose?
17:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> hmm, I wouldn't say that the generated protocol is not human-readable. I must confess, that it's easier tho. Doesn't that suggest another problem with the netcode if it can't be written in a human readable manner?
17:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> the python file is human readable
17:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> the generated code less so
17:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> you read and modify the python file, so there is no problem
17:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> assembly is human-readable if you try enough too ;) it's a spectrum
17:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> Alright, makes sense, since it's all the same it might also be easier to maintain!
