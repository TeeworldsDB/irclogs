02:02 < bridge_> [freenode] <Digit> u-oh.  i just clicked the envelope toggle button in the editor... it does not toggle!  it just chews up more of the editor screen each click.  ... i clicked it 3 times, now my editor window is only 1/4 screen letterbox.  help!  how do i fix that?
03:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Click one more time
03:46 < bridge_> [freenode] <Digit> oh good.  n_n  i feared i would be a fool for clicking 1 more time and i would lose the entire view to this (presumed) bug.

10:37 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> hmm
10:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> dat +36kb on dm3
10:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> huh
10:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> weird
10:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i heard thats due to optimization or something
10:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I have no idea how it's done there
10:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I'll update it again with an older client

10:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> 38 to 76kb
10:52 <@Dune> lol
11:00 <@Dune> whoops heinrich5991
11:00 < minus> let's see if the automatic deployment still works
11:02 <@Dune> welp
11:02 < minus> yeah, looks like no
11:03 < minus> >   Active: active (running) since Fri 2018-02-16 20:32:56 CET; 8 months 24 days ago
11:03 < minus> hmmm
11:12 <@heinrich5991> Dune: ?
11:12 <@Dune> well, the notice
11:13 < minus> welp, i dropped the config for that domain in nginx
11:13 <@Dune> welp²
11:18 <@heinrich5991> Dune: fixed
11:18 <@heinrich5991> forgot to do it for the documentation repo
11:19 <@Dune> :)
11:19 <@heinrich5991> oh, -11-11 11:11:11 was recently
11:20 <@Dune> ho
11:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> dune you don't have the rights to manage the documentation repo?
11:21 <@Dune> normally not, Sonix
11:22 <@Dune> yeah I don't
11:22 <@heinrich5991> fixed
11:23 <@Dune> TIL WWI armistice day was at 11:00
11:23 <@Dune> they missed it by 11min
11:23 <@heinrich5991> still a good idea to have someone look over the changes, in general
11:23 <@Dune> +1 heinrich5991
11:24 <@heinrich5991> Dune: are you on windows?
11:24 <@heinrich5991> i.e. have you tested this?
11:24 <@Dune> yes right now
11:24 <@Dune> I had the problem alongside with some other guy on discord
11:24 <@Dune> same errors, because just copy pasted x86 from the doc
11:25 <@Dune> strangely enough, 64-bit arch is x64 but 32-bit must use a big X: X86. maybe that makes sense somehow
11:25 <@heinrich5991> hmm
11:25 <@heinrich5991> todo#2, add cmake to 0.7
11:25 <@Dune> I wrote arch=x36 and bam still compiled most of things haha
11:26 <@Dune> yeah, it's issue #1586
11:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> ah ok heinrich has the rights too, forgot :p
11:26 < minus> CMake should be pretty easy for teeworlds
11:26 < minus> why add cmake though?
11:26 <@Dune> "I intend to do that at some point, would improve support with Microsoft Visual Studio for example (they have native support for CMake these days)."
11:27 <@Dune> - anonymous fan
11:29 < minus> good point
11:29 < minus> also allows one to use CLion
11:29 < minus> also makes the build less of a special snowflake
11:34 <@Dune> I like snowflakes, still using bam at work :D
11:39 < minus> :o
11:39 < minus> using CMake at work
11:39 < minus> it does the job and has good compatibility with tooling
11:41 <@Dune> cmake does very strange things sometimes

12:42 <@Dune> hey tee_
12:42 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> is that a bot
12:42 <@Dune> that's a bot bridge from quakenet to freenode to discord
12:43 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> now thats a bridge lol
12:43 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> successfully compiled 0.6.5
12:43 <@Dune> yes, but we're very far, so you have to shout a bit
12:43 <@Dune> cool. any nethash problems?
12:43 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> but struggle to compile 0.7
12:43 <@Dune> ah
12:43 <@Dune> it's a bit more difficult, what's your OS?
12:43 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> erm version problems, most servers dont let me in
12:43 <@Dune> with 0.6.5?
12:43 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> linux ubuntu 18 04
12:43 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> ye
12:43 <@Dune> yeah that's an issue, gotta revert a commit from heinrich5991

12:53 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> i did ../bam5/bam
12:53 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> and worked.. lol
12:53 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> it was some SDL dependency
12:54 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> i installed some stuff yesterday at night
12:54 <@Dune> ahh :)
12:54 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> prob fixed
13:06 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> bam release doesnt work
13:06 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> how do i set arguments
13:07 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> e.g. target=debug or target=release
13:07 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> ok found in bam.lua
13:08 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> did conf=release
13:21 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> what is the code responsible for key events
13:21 <@Dune> what kind of key events, binds?
13:21 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> ive found the CBinds class
13:21 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> yes
13:21 <@Dune> well there you go :)
13:21 <@Dune> compiling docs: https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything
13:22 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> ive compiled both 6.5 and 7.0 now
13:22 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> yesterday i deleted the directory cuz it was messy
13:22 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> working fine
13:23 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> i used visual studio in windows for c++
13:23 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> atm im using sublime and this is strange
13:24 <@Dune> using sumblime too
13:26 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> f12 doesnt work properly
13:27 <@Dune> in teeworlds?
13:29 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> no, in sublime. goto definition
13:30 <@Dune> oh, didn't know that was a bind, nice lol
13:30 <@Dune> well you probably have to open the whole project?
13:30 <@Dune> does it work nowhere?
13:31 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> just works with classes
13:31 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> and few methods
13:32 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> in visual studio it would work with anything, easier to navigate through code
13:56 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> the CLaser is handled by the server!?
13:56 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> i dont have control over it on my client?
14:17 <@Dune> what do you mean?
14:17 <@Dune> laser particles are server infgo, yes
14:17 <@Dune> about the goto definition, you need to make a project for it to work in sublime i'm afriad
14:25 <@Dune> goddammit my linux client downloaded a map and I can find it nowhere on my system D: it's so weird
14:26 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> what about the +fire
14:26 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> its sent to server
14:26 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> and its processed by server?
14:27 <@Dune> yes
14:27 <@Dune> server shoots
14:28 <@Dune> what are you trying to do?
14:28 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> right now i want to iterate entity list
14:28 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> the active players except specs
14:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> fresh cloned source failed to build on debian

14:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> omg wait ft is freetype?
14:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> woops i didnt install that sowwy
14:51 <@Dune> :D
15:00 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> yes i had that problem yesterday
15:00 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> install freetype6 dev
15:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Imo the teeworlds github repo (readme) lacks some dependency comands
15:00 <@Dune> yeah, definitely
15:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its always annoying to search the right commands in the webs
15:00 <@Dune> maybe this could be added to the wiki somehow
15:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i decided to just install all dependencys ddnet provides in their readme
15:00 <@Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything
15:00 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> btw i am looking for IDE with code intel
15:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea i also checked that one
15:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but its also an extra step
15:01 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> sublime doesnt support c++ at all and lacks definitions
15:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i am on github if i clone the source so i want it there
15:01 <@Dune> yeah, good point
15:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> or atleast an link to compling wiki in the readme
15:01 <@Dune> might want to open an issue in teeworlds or teeworlds/documentation :)

15:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> do i have to restart something ?
15:02 < bridge_> [freenode] <tee_> eclipse vs netbeans ?
15:04 < rand> either freetype is/was missing when you ran bam at the first time
15:04 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i installed freetype and i restarted terminal and rerun bam
15:05 < rand> orâ¦ i don't know

15:05 < rand> at first run, bam creates a file

15:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh ye the onfig
15:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> should i clear things
15:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ima try

15:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh ye
15:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> that did the job thanks rand
15:06 < rand> I think it should contain 'freetype.use_pkgconfig = true'
15:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i didnt expect that

15:09 <@Dune> you mean the tees?
15:09 <@Dune> maybe because we're used to low saturation
15:09 <@Dune> but I agree I would have prefered it a bit lower still

17:50 <@Dune> hey rand
17:50 <@Dune> do you know what should be done further with your 64client PR?
17:50 <@Dune> you said it's somewhat of a draft
18:10 < Learath2> Why doesn't teeworlds just move up to 64 player servers already?
18:10 < bridge_> [freenode] <teee> would need huge maps
18:10 < bridge_> [freenode] <teee> 8x8 ctf is already a big party xD
18:11 < Learath2> Having the code support 64 players doesn't mean the vanilla gamemodes need to allow it, nor does it mean that the server owner isn't allowed to set it back to 16
18:14 <@Dune> teee: 64 client is not 64 players
18:15 <@Dune> 16 is already borderline, yes
18:15 < Learath2> I fully meant players when I said players btw
18:15 <@Dune> 64 plyers is wayy too much, 16 is messy enough imo
18:15 < bridge_> [freenode] <teee> maybe for zombie mods
18:16 < bridge_> [freenode] <teee> in counter strike the only 64 slot servers were the fun/zombies/etc
18:16 <@Dune> zombie mods do fine with 12 imo
18:16 < Learath2> We have been running 64p mods for like the last 6 years, it's just unwise to put an arbitrary limit on the number of clients protocol wise
18:18 < Learath2> Well I do understand that there needs to be A limit, making it smaller then 64 while there are many running 64p servers is just meh imho
18:18 <@Dune> ? 64 is a pretty big limit on the client #
18:21 < Learath2> #1580 even goes as far as to being a nuisence by adding a MAX_PLAYERS, it's just an unnecessary hindrance. Let's just up MAX_CLIENTS to 64
18:21 < Learath2> ^^is what I was trying to get at
18:22 <@Dune> MAX_PLAYERS wasn't there before?
18:23 <@Dune> it used to be 12 but was up'd to 16
18:24 < Learath2> MAX_PLAYERS didn't use to exist
18:24 < bridge_> [freenode] <teee> MAX_CLIENTS
18:24 < rand> Dune: I don't have anything to add to the PR
18:24 < bridge_> [freenode] <teee> btw
18:24 < Learath2> MAX_CLIENTS always existed
18:24 < bridge_> [freenode] <teee> how to check if a client is near
18:24 < bridge_> [freenode] <teee> like, inside the required field of view
18:24 < Learath2> A Client an't be near
18:25 < rand> Learath2: note that the server can lie about the number of player, and the client will handle more than 16 players anyway
18:25 < bridge_> [freenode] <teee> he needs to be at a certain distance or the server wont send his info
18:25 < rand> (about #1580)
18:26 < rand> the scoreboard will be awefull though
18:26 < Learath2> rand: Why does the server have to lie? Can't we just make it work normally for once?
18:26 < rand> dunno, I don't really care, to be able to handle more than 16 players is a first step at least
18:27 < Learath2> @teee what are you trying to do? Are you trying to do it on the server or the client?
18:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> If 64 slots are possible codewise this doesnât force vanilla maps / gametypes to change. It just allows community mods to work better. And 64 is not too much for community mods. And it can also be fun on custom vanilla maps.
18:35 < rand> the only issue that you point out is https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1580/commits/1da4671652bdafe38e70e93c2e690179cd709e76
18:35 < rand> without this commit, every thing is fine I guess, right ?
18:36 < rand> MAX_PLAYERS exists in order to name the constant 16 that rules vanilla at least
18:37 <@Dune> yep
18:38 <@Dune> rand: you didn't plan to add anything to the PR? but oy said there's missing stuff for it to get in
18:39 < rand> hm
18:39 < rand> did he ?
18:40 <@Dune> okay, so he didn't say what yet then I guess
18:40 < rand> I don't find anything about it missing stuff
18:40 < rand> -it

21:16 <@Dune> what are you trying to do?
21:16 < bridge_> [freenode] <teee> store my position into vec2
