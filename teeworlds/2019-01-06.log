10:23 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master d215c73 oy: use info provided by sdl for mouse double clicks
12:06 <@Dune> hey
12:06 < Oy> hey
12:06 <@Dune> I mailed the flathub guys
12:06 <@Dune> doesn²t sound like much work
12:06 < Oy> ok
12:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> hi
12:19 <@Dune> hey
12:20 <@Dune> @heinrich5991 unfortunately the l10n json files have some awkward indentation that makes json.dump break the diff :/ haven't found a clean way to change that from the json dump output
12:21 <@Dune> I might screw the diff anyway
12:22 <@heinrich5991> Dune: it doesn't output the language files in the format they're in right now?
12:22 <@Dune> no
12:22 <@Dune> it indents once more
12:22 <@Dune> because there is some {key:"[ stuff
12:23 <@Dune> I could do a replace of \n\t with \n, that would fix it I believe
12:23 <@Dune> (it also doesn't keep author info before the fix I wrote)
12:24 <@heinrich5991> (re.replace(r'^\t', '', str) :) )
12:24 <@heinrich5991> ah
12:24 <@heinrich5991> sorry for that
12:24 <@Dune> I'm not sure they're tabs though
12:24 <@Dune> json doesn't seem to like tabs
12:25 <@Dune> alright, I'll do a replace :)
12:25 <@heinrich5991> I see `indent="\t"` in my script
12:25 <@heinrich5991> so I guess they're tabs
12:25 <@Dune> yeah, I had to fix the json.load function with strict=False because of that
12:25 <@Dune> (it doesn't like tabs)
12:26 <@Dune> the tabs author info look like "heinrich\t\t\t(2013)" now though
12:26 <@Dune> (literally \t)
12:26 <@heinrich5991> >>> json.loads("\t[1,\t2,\t3]")
12:26 <@heinrich5991> [1, 2, 3]
12:26 <@heinrich5991> oh, you mean in data fields
12:27 <@Dune> yeah
12:28 <@heinrich5991> https://stackoverflow.com/a/19799355
12:28 <@heinrich5991> yea, apparently tabs are forbidden in json strings
12:28 <@heinrich5991> I wonder how they get in there
12:28 <@heinrich5991> *got
12:28 <@Dune> yeah
12:28 <@heinrich5991> >>> json.dumps("\t")
12:28 <@heinrich5991> '"\\t"'
12:28 <@Dune> yeah it seems to work
12:28 <@heinrich5991> python correctly encodes them. perhaps someone edited them by hand
12:29 <@Dune> it didn't on windows
12:29 <@Dune> the author info was edited by hand yes
12:30 < Oy> Sonix do you have the image for the settings button, which should be added to the server browser?
12:30 <@heinrich5991> then I wouldn't put the fix into the scripts, rather fix it once. the automatic output doesn't have that problem
12:31 <@Dune> the fix about what, tabs in data?
12:31 <@Dune> that should be fixed once yeah
12:31 <@heinrich5991> yes
12:39 < Oy> Sonix the one you used here https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2030615/47305459-cc09d600-d629-11e8-9f4c-67568d79b051.png
12:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix
12:41 < Oy> should there be an option in settings->controls for inp_grab?
12:41 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1952:  Add `str_startswith`, `str_endswith`, `str_truncate` (master...pr_str_startsendswith) https://git.io/fhsOS
12:41 <@Dune> Oy: probably, lots of people ask ingame
12:42 <@Dune> btw do you think the mouse sens bar should align like shown in green there https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1951 ?
12:43 <@heinrich5991> why do we override sdl's default wrt to inp_grab? was it due to mouse pads?
12:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> oy i've used an unicode character for that icon
12:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2699/index.htm
13:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> oy, there is another problem with compiling on windows x64 with the latest changes. https://pastebin.com/aE83ASNs
13:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i think the X in the corner should change to a poweroff/on icon https://unicodepowersymbol.com/
13:28 < Oy> Dune:  ok
13:28 < Oy> Sonix ok, will check that out
13:28 < Oy> Fisico just try again
13:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> oy after 4 tried it worked LOL
13:30 < Oy> seems the file downloader failed
13:32 < Oy> Dune: probably best if the scrollbar would start automatically after the text
13:32 <@Dune> right
13:33 <@Dune> not sure if it fits all scrollbar scenarios though, that'd be some work
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I think the X in the corner should be kept a X .. power off symbol doesn't make sense for software, desktop applications
