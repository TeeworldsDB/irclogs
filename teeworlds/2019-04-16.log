20:42 < Dune> I just realized rand's server does not set the bot flag
20:43 < rand> is it ?
20:44 < Oy> really?
20:44 < Oy> thought so
20:45 < rand> same
20:45 < Dune> hopefully not, or there would be a bug :D
20:45 < Dune> it works when I set a bot flag locally
20:45 < Dune> oh, the joystick tolerance PR is there
20:48 < Oy> Dune: the bot skin pr looks good to me. Can i merge it or wait for the skin color discussion?
20:48 < Dune> I think it's good
20:48 < Dune> Any improvement can be added on top
20:49 < Oy> yeah
20:49 < Dune> @LordSk will you have some spare time to test the joystick tolerance thing?
20:50 < Oy> i remember games used to have such a tolerance setting back in the 90s :)
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah sure, probably sometime tomorrow
20:52 < Oy> would be good
20:54 < Dune> the debian guys asked for the CVE to be in the changelog btw
20:54 < Dune> (of the three security issues)
20:54 < rand> well indeed
20:54 <@heinrich5991> we have a CVE? :o
20:54 < Dune> https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=927152
20:55 <@heinrich5991> oh, these
20:55 < rand> flag was set for serverbrowser only
20:55 < Dune> that's what I thought
20:57 < rand> (and it use magic numbers in that part)
20:58 < Oy> anything else needed for next release?
20:59 < rand> Dune: it should be fixed
20:59 < Dune> Oy, needed, not really
20:59 < Dune> maybe I can finish a stable scoreboard
20:59 < Dune> without a messy UI integration
20:59 < Dune> I should probably just start writing the changelog and stuff
21:01 < Oy> lots of work :)
21:01 < Oy> there's always a next version :P
21:01 < Dune> yeah :)
21:02 < Dune> I mean, I could just put it without the customisation part
21:02 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2086
21:02 < Dune> is this severe btw?
21:02 < Dune> there is no CVE for that one
21:03 < Dune> also, will we do https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1773 ?
21:04 < Oy> dunno if #1773 works
21:06 < Dune> seems to work for ChillerDragon and it always worked for me
21:06 < Dune> Maybe gfx_highdpi 0 should be attempted as another fallback if initialization fails?
21:10 < Oy> well that's just an issue on windows and mac. needs to be tested there
21:10 < Oy> linux works out of the box
21:12 < Dune> so we need to find a windows with high dpi
21:15 < Oy> would be good :)
21:16 < Oy> could hook up my win machine to the tv, but too lazy :P
21:17 < Dune> huh, never thought of that
