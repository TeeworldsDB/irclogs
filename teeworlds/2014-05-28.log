09:45 < ghost91> good morning
09:58 <@minus> hey ghost91
11:37 < BotoX> WOW https://github.com/django/django/pull/2692 WOW
11:44 <@matricks> wtf
11:45 <@matricks> BotoX: http://www.userfriendly.org/cartoons/archives/03nov/uf006180.gif
11:48 < BotoX> but comrade is offensive, just think about all the people that have lost their comrades in war!
11:48 <@matricks> that cartoon is soooooo old :)
11:48 < BotoX> Also the teeworlds "master" branch should be renamed to "leader"
11:49 <@matricks> heh
11:49 <@matricks> yeah, but it doesn't have any slaves
11:49 < BotoX> I don't get these people, why would one get "hurt" over reading documentation / editing config files which mention master and slave
11:50 <@minus> BotoX: yes, let's rename it from master to f√ºhrer
12:07 < BotoX> h-hey, what about the master server BLACKlist :-)
12:07 < BotoX> much racism, very offense, wow
