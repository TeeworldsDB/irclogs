21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is it a gamer client feature or a vanilla feature that you can write colorful messages, but not actually see them, when receiving them?
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> while writing it's colorful, when sending and visible in chat it ain't colorful
21:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's neither :D
21:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's a bug of my client
21:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> When I ported it to 0.7, I disabled chat colors because it was a poor idea, but forgot to do that in textinput
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> oh, ok :c
