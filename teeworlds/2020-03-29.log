21:08 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Hello
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Hey, can anyone explain when exactly prediction errors can occur? I am talking about these:
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L1557
21:11 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> When I "Play" for server list in Teeworlds I lost 3/4 of times my wifi connection in Ubuntu GNU / Linux
21:11 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Can you help me please?
21:20 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> In Teeworlds game when I click "Play" for server list  I loose my wifi connection in Ubuntu GNU / Linux, why?
21:38 < Dune> Ortzi: Hello. that is strange, to say the least
21:39 < Dune> What is your network? Home network?
21:40 < Dune> Does it instantly reconnect to your wifi?
21:40 < Dune> Is your wifi particularly weak, do you play other online games?
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @fokkonaut on clientside mostly with connection errors/problems, rocketjumps, teleports and deaths
21:41 < Dune> Ortzi: can you run tail -F /var/log/messages and reproduce the bug, while monitoring the messages?
21:42 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Mar 29 21:37:15 Ubuntu-VN7-791G wpa_supplicant[1420]: wlp7s0: Reject scan trigger since one is already pending
21:42 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> This is what I read
21:42 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> related to the WIFI connection and Teeworlds
21:42 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> I also can read the teeworlds console in /var/log/system
21:42 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Mar 29 21:32:58 Ubuntu-VN7-791G steam.desktop[26522]: [2020-03-29 21:32:58][chat]: -1: : *** 'Kaptar' entered and joined the game
21:42 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> is this normal?
21:42 < Dune> no
21:43 < Dune> probably you started teeworlds in the same console or something?
21:43 < Dune> "Reject scan trigger since one is already pending" >> where did you see that
21:43 < Dune> in /var/log/ something?
21:44 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Guest19765,
21:45 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> These are the last lines of my /var/log/system
21:45 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> https://pastebin.com/sS0RVxVQ
21:45 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Teeworlds server scan crashed my wifi just now, that are the lines
21:46 < Dune> I see some teeworlds stuff, that's odd
21:46 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Wifi seems to be conneced (icon I mean) but I need to reconnect from Gnome Shell WIFI preferences
21:46 < Dune> > pFont memory usage: 3407872
21:46 < Dune> hm
21:46 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Dune?
21:46 < Dune> Yes?
21:47 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> I read Guest19765, who is dune?
21:47 < Dune> You're talking over a bridge
21:47 < Dune> hi from quakenet
21:47 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Ah, I understand
21:47 < Dune> heinrich5991: looks like the bridge has a weird name over at freenode :)
21:48 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Guest19765, so you see the error origin?
21:48 < Dune> Ortzi: I would suspect this is rather an issue from your router or your system than from Teeworlds. Can you play other games fine on this machine / can you play Teeworlds fine on another machine?
21:48 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Yes, Guest19765 , without any problem
21:48 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> And it only happens at server scan
21:49 < Dune> Yes to question 1 or 2 ?
21:49 < Dune> Okay, we can try some things
21:49 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> I can play online games, navigate...
21:49 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> I updated from Ubuntu 18.04 to 20.04, the problem is the same before and now
21:50 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> only in teeworlds at scan
21:50 < Dune> hmm
21:50 < Dune> well teeworlds sends a lot of requests at scan
21:50 < Dune> we could try to lower that but I'm not certain anymore that there is a config that lets us do that
21:53 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> I am using now teeworlds from repositories and it works perfectly
21:53 < Dune> Try br_max_requests 2 in f1
21:54 < Dune> huh
21:54 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> I used to use (... xD) teeworlds this way before, but once I installed it on steam I only used steam version
21:54 < Dune> sounds like this is a version issue, interesting
21:54 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> I had always LAG in steamversion of teeworlds
21:54 < Dune> 20.04... lemme check
21:54 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> I dont have any lag now
21:54 < Dune> they have 0.7.2 or should have
21:54 < Dune> can you check the version on the title screen?
21:55 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> So the problem is Teeworlds  - Steam : 1. Scan crashes my wifi - . LAG
21:55 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Now works PERFECT
21:55 < Dune> Can you check what the buggy version is and what the version that works is, please?
21:55 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> erabiltzaile@Ubuntu-VN7-791G:~$ apt-cache policy teeworlds
21:55 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> teeworlds:
21:55 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Instalatuta: 0.7.2-5
21:55 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Hautagaia:   0.7.2-5
21:56 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> 0.7.4 in Steam
21:56 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> 0.7.4 Teeworlds - Steam give me problems
21:56 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> 0.7.2-5 works perfect
21:57 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Without lag... (yeahhh xD)
21:57 < Dune> Okay, thanks, that is strange
21:57 < Dune> If you feel like trying Steam Teeworlds again, you try to lower br_max_requests in f1 console ingame
21:57 < Dune> by default it is 25
21:57 < Dune> you can make it much lower (will make the server list load slower)
21:59 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Scan from 0.7.2 crashed my wifi again
22:00 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> connection seems to be better without lag, much better
22:00 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> but scan crashed again connection ;(
22:21 < Dune> Ortzi: try what I suggested
22:21 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Guest19765, what?
22:23 < Dune> what I just wrote
22:23 < Dune> If you feel like trying Steam Teeworlds again, you try to lower br_max_requests in f1 console ingame
22:23 < Dune> by default it is 25
22:25 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Guest19765, no Steam Teeworlds crashes my wifi too, Guest19765 ...
22:32 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Anyway thanks for your help
22:33 < Dune> do you understand what I said?
22:33 < Dune> you can open a console ingame
22:33 < Dune> and limit the browser requests to avoid those wifi crashes (maybe)
22:35 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> The crash is only when I do SCAN
22:35 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> I understood you but I dont know how to do that
22:36 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> Other thung is that console from teeworlds is registered in /var/log/syslog, is that normal? xD
22:36 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> I see chat inside syslog
22:36 < bridge> [freenode] <Ortzi> should happen that?
22:47 < Dune> you should use f1 ingame
