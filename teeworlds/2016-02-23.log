09:22 <@matricks> minus: hey dude
09:22 <@minus> yes, sir, matricks, sir
09:23 <@matricks> minus: we should cycle the contact email on the webpage
09:23 <@minus> 2much spam?
09:24 <@matricks> it has gotten on some weird list
09:24 <@matricks> I know all about zip magic
09:25 <@minus> info@?
09:26 <@matricks> minus: why not
09:26 <@matricks> minus: weh.. is it you that handles the forwarding of emails as wlel?
09:27 <@minus> yes
09:27 <@minus> i'll turn off the old address so mails to it get rejected :)
09:27 <@matricks> you can forward to teeworlds@matricks.se
09:27 <@matricks> and your self if you wanna
09:27 <@minus> that's what it currently does
09:28 <@matricks> goodie
09:28 <@minus> one meail address changed, the rest needs to be done in git
09:29 <@matricks> oh, is there email addresses in the code?
09:29 <@minus> no, in the docs
09:29 <@matricks> ahhh
09:29 <@matricks> shouldn't be, just refer to the website I would say
09:31 <@minus> well, docs are published on the website, they're just stored in git
09:31 <@minus> seems like automatic building/pushing to the website broke :(
09:39 <@matricks> :(
09:42 <@minus> misaka not working, time to fix
09:44 <@minus> okay
09:46 <@minus> this is weird, misaka (python module for markdown parsing, uses CFFI) did build just fine although CFFI wasn't installed. then importing the thing of course failed
