00:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> I realize i never said anything in IRC about my attempts to rework TextRender.
00:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> I took the concept of deferred text render, that was used in in TextShadowed, and applied it everywhere by storing the deferred text into CTextCursor.
00:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> Also i'm rewriting the code for laying out text and supports text alignment directly in TextRender
00:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> Currently the rework is going pretty well with noticeable performance increase with large amount of text on screen.
00:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> But I've changed the API of textrender, so I also rewrote all instance of text throughout the client. Currently everything is rewritten except chat and console.
00:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> but I don't feel like rewriting text calls in the already bloated `chat.cpp`, would it be sensible if I deal with https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2706 first or should I restore text calls in chat and console to their original states first.
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> Here's the rework branch: https://github.com/TsFreddie/teeworlds/tree/0.7-textrender-deferred
00:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> btw, this is additional reworks besides the font texture work to support multiple fonts, if it wasn't clear.
12:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> By the way who are IRC-only folks who actively develop teeworlds atm?
12:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Pure_luck> I just want to know when to write something here.
12:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The one you are looking for is Oy ðŸ˜„
12:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I don't think there is anyone else irc-only
12:20 < ChillerDragon> :/
12:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Ah, there is ChillerDragon too. He used to be on discord too, forgot he skipped town
12:23 < ChillerDragon> xd
12:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> poor Chiller, forgotten by the world, left alone in IRC with no water and food. :'/
12:24 < ChillerDragon> also f s t d (do not want to ping)
12:24 < ChillerDragon> well not too active tw dev but atleast he was involved and is still around
12:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Robyte is also on IRC sometimes
13:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> speed demon
