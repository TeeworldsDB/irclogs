11:30 < Savander> hi
15:22 < Savander> http://ddnet.tw/compare/Savander/Savander/Savander/Savander/
15:22 < Savander> oh, wrong
15:22 < Savander> channel
15:22 < Savander> sorry D:
15:24 < BotoX> much compare
15:24 < BotoX> very Savander 
15:24 < BotoX> wow
15:24 < Savander> >
15:24 < Savander> >.<
15:24 < BotoX> https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/941
15:25 < BotoX> meh is a damn cool person, helped me out with a C++ issue before hehe
15:25 < BotoX> worth a read
15:26  * Alirezakaj slaps XXLTomate around a bit with a large fishbot
15:44 < Alirezakaj> Are you there deen ?  !    
15:51 < Alirezakaj> fu....k irc channel ;l   that no one answer you 
15:53 < deen> oh well, too late
15:56 < heinrich5991> BotoX: that's a pretty long thread..
17:27 < BotoX> yup
19:06 < Learath2> BotoX: that thread gave me cancer
19:10 < EastByte> yep, it's kinda sad to see such topics over and over again
19:12 < iX__lolo> Hi
19:12 < Learath2> its kinda retarded that this person thinks they can just get someone kicked off a project for his views
19:15 < iX__lolo> I have found a server that have the game type "CTF", which is in reality no CTF Server. Here a Screenshot: http://img5.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/unbenanntbgi47ylkoq.png
19:16 < Savander> it's client side
19:16 < Savander> those bots are clients
19:18 < iX__lolo> If someone make a double kill, a new broadcast comes with your name.
19:18 < nheir> the server uses TeeBot
19:18 < nheir> https://github.com/Allu2/TeeBot2/
19:19 < iX__lolo> Ah.. okay thanks
19:20 < iX__lolo> Byebye
20:27 <@minus> lol BotoX, read a few then looked at the scrollbar
20:27 < BotoX> hehe
20:28  * minus would have closed the issue as invalid
20:30 <@minus> better things to do than waste my time with… i don't even know how to describe these people
20:30 <@minus> trolls doesn't fit, because they're serious
20:31 <@minus> you, BotoX, apparently don't have better things to do \o/
21:20 < Edible> idiots?
21:20 < Edible> where!?
21:36 < BotoX> minus: I'm done with school, gotta relax now ^^
21:37 < BotoX> idk, thinking about projects I could build
21:37 <@minus> tfw listened to presentations for 6 hours today
21:37 < BotoX> IoT stuff, automation, etc.
21:37 <@minus> IoT sounds so gay
21:37 < BotoX> :p
21:37 < BotoX> it's pretty cool though
21:37 <@minus> yep.
21:38 < BotoX> thinking about building a current meter + relais circuit for every outlet in the house
21:38 < BotoX> which connect to a central server over some bus system
21:38 < BotoX> and you can read the power usage on every outlet and turn it off
21:38 < BotoX> or the system could detect when everyone has left the house
21:38 < BotoX> and turn off pre-configured outlets
21:38 < BotoX> turn off all lights, etc.
21:39 <@minus> how would you the bus?
21:39 < BotoX> maybe CAN
21:39 <@minus> PLC?
21:39 < BotoX> it has to be cheap
21:39 < BotoX> and small
21:39 < BotoX> small is the biggest problem probably
21:39 < BotoX> how'd you fit that next to an outlet
21:39 < BotoX> also what about power
21:40 < BotoX> power the IC over the bus from a central 5V psu
21:40 <@minus> 5V over long wires?
21:41 < BotoX> an IC isn't using much power
21:41 < BotoX> and they wouldn't be that long I guess
21:41 < BotoX> how long could the longest wire be in a house, 25m?
21:41 <@minus> i'd still expect a somewhat significant voltage drop
21:42 < BotoX> could be
21:42 <@minus> though i'm not much into EE, so no clue
21:42 < BotoX> actually
21:42 < BotoX> what's the voltage on ethernet
21:43 <@minus> ethernet signals are 5V?
21:43 < BotoX> -2V – 2V
21:43 <@minus> hm
21:43 < BotoX> and it's 100M max ^^
21:43 < BotoX> also twisted pair
21:43 <@minus> but they don't have to care much about voltage drops
21:43 < BotoX> I think they do lol
21:44 < BotoX> well actually
21:44 <@minus> as long as the result is still binary :P
21:44 < BotoX> it might matter though
21:44 <@minus> get a 25m cable and try~
21:44 < BotoX> the relais are using some power
21:44 < BotoX> that are used to switch the current
21:44 <@minus> though you can always use a higher voltage to compensate
21:44 < BotoX> but putting power supplies everywhere isn't really feasible either
21:44 <@minus> you could use solid state relays too
21:45 < BotoX> expensive
21:45 < BotoX> but probably a good idea
21:45 <@minus> my brother got himself some, 7€ per piece iirc
21:45 <@minus> not cheap indeed
21:45 < BotoX> whereas a relais can be bought for like 1€ :p
21:45 <@minus> he had normal relays before
21:46 <@minus> but the broke pretty quickly
21:46 < BotoX> oh lol
21:46 < BotoX> how often was he switching them haha
21:46 <@minus> he uses them to control rollläden
21:46 <@minus> shutters i guess
21:46 <@minus> around twice a day
21:46 < BotoX> that shouldn't have been a problem for them, hmm
21:47 <@minus> maybe the rolling shutters generate some load bad for relays
21:47 < BotoX> doubt it, just two pieces of metal
21:48 < BotoX> SSEs are too expensive :/
21:48 < BotoX> also they can't switch that much current
21:48 <@minus> can always just one of each for experimenting
21:48 < BotoX> I think a normal outlet can provide 16A?
21:48 <@minus> the SSRs he got do up to 5kW iirc
21:49 < BotoX> oh
21:49 < BotoX> that'd be fine then
21:49 <@minus> i was surprised too
21:50 < BotoX> http://www.conrad.at/ce/de/product/162523/Elektronische-Lastrelais-Sharp-S-216-S02-Last-Strom-16-A-Schaltspannung-250-VAC?ref=searchDetail
21:50 < BotoX> 14€ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
21:50 <@minus> i need a list of those unicode faces
21:51 <@minus> time to get websockets + python3
21:57 < BotoX> minus: http://hukd.mydealz.de/freebies/it-studenten-kostenloser-raspberry-pi-b-1-jahres-ix-ct-abo-und-25-buecher-de-gutschein-545387
21:57 < BotoX> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
21:57 < BotoX> gotta do that
21:58 < BotoX> need another soc for some shit anyways
22:24 < BotoX> http://www.ebay.com/itm/151718758090
22:24 < BotoX> lmao mates
22:24 < BotoX> wtf
22:25 < BotoX> should I buy this hahahah
22:25 < BotoX> oh shit wrong channel
22:26 < Savander> you should!
22:27 < BotoX> I did haha
22:27 < BotoX> asking to be scammed so much
22:27 < BotoX> we'll see now how good paypal protection is
22:44 < heinrich5991> I suppose we need some clear rules regarding non-standard vanilla servers
22:44 < heinrich5991> including econ bots, client bots etc.
