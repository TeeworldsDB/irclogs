00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune does bomb 0.7 exist?
00:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> almost
00:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/tree/bomb
00:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> what does almost mean?
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> okay it's not up to date and I get cmake errors unfortunatly
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't use cmake
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but you can easily add the missing files
00:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> git rebase shouldn't be too difficult I guess
00:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> git submodule update --init and adding bomb.h and cpp did the job
00:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> thank you ❤️ server is online
00:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> something is really broken xD
