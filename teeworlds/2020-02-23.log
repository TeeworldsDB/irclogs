15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is there way to get a player's ip + port in the gamecontext? like GetClientAddr() which seemingly only returns the IP
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> without modifying the source.
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> without modifying probably not
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but using econ you can sneak it
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> as econ has access to status command and/or can check the logs, and in the join leave msgs you get the full ip
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> + port
16:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> "in the gamecontext" sounds like not modifying source other than gamecontext.cpp
17:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah, but seemingly adding an optional parameter to GetClientAddr() that's default to false is the only not hacky way
17:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @ChillerDragon https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2475 any feedback in regard to the patch?
17:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's in the comment
17:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> #development
17:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah the patch sry didnt read
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im not too sure tbh
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i like to complain about the logging but im still agianst changing it :/
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its just a mess to maintain two versions of logging then to support older versions
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also multiple logs might give you insight on errors when a client disconnects during connection in which stage it happend or similar cases
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, the patch only removes one specific line when joining by adding a player name and the disconnect messages were added that contain
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nick, id, ip, port
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2475#issuecomment-590090413
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye i red the patch
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the granularity more or less stays
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> still every logparser has to be rewritten
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and every logparser that wants to support the olg version as well has to maintain duplicated code
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> old*
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> do you use that one line that has been removed?
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> one line?
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> didnt you remove multiple
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well i use them all but i guess its not about me
17:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> me having to rewrite a parser shouldnt be a holdback to refactor tw
17:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> player joined...
17:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's the only line removed and replaced
17:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> to contain nick, id, ip, port
18:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> also now one would only need to parse for two lines without any complext logic
18:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> complex*
18:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> server_join, server_leave
18:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye ikr
18:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> parsing two lines is annoying
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but didnt you duplicate information now?
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> maybe it would be best if you could show a diff of the actual log output
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> in my opinion the logs are not consistent
18:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> gotta look in my copy history x)
18:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is commented
18:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ty
18:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> seems likes its two times your patch tho so not very comparable
18:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @jxsl13 
18:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 1. add =false to the other header too for port
18:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 2. i dont like that the gamecontext is handling the message. the engine is aware of networking stuff and the client states and should also handle these messages. The GAME context is for the GAME stuff imo
18:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But I agree that the messages should be simplified, but as said not from gamecontext
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is the engine aware of nickname?
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> of course
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Lol
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> *server()* ->clientname xd
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the problem is actually those ingame states
18:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> what do you mean
18:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the engine also drops players before they are even properly connected to the server
18:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and then loose their connection
18:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or disconnect
18:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and how is it a problem?
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> dont log these i guess
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> are those connecting -> ready -> enter handled by the engine as well?
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> then gotta take a look there
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L692
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> take a look here for example
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> the engine even calls the gamecontext function
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L926
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> aswell as the joining
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> moving it to engine/server makes the Port parameter obsolete
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (Y)
20:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i got some really weird bugs with sv_high_bandwith
20:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> for me the ping(!) gets better and for others it gets worse
20:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and it's not a local server
20:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> good ping -> better, bad ping with a lot of packet loss -> gets worse
20:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that was kinda the result of the previous discussion here.
