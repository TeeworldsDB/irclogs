16:08 < bridge_> [freenode] <pet89> Hello
16:09 < bridge_> [freenode] <pet89> Why teeworlds contains now 15 players servers with no players ?
16:58 < Learath2>  You mean the servers full of random named players? It's an attack, that has been patched but a lot of server owners didn't apply the patch
17:40 < bridge_> [freenode] <pet89> ah thank you, you're the third confirming that
17:41 < bridge_> [freenode] <pet89> so I feel confident about the truth of that
17:41 <@Dune> pet89: 0.6.5 fixes this
17:41 <@Dune> see https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=journal&id=12565 for explanations
17:49 < bridge_> [freenode] <pet89> ah ok. I don't all understand, but I see that teeworlds is in crisis
17:49 <@Dune> well, it's fine, just need to upgrade
17:49 <@Dune> there were security issues before
17:50 < bridge> [freenode] <pet89> bots seen on my client, full-but-empty servers, few servers cause of ddos attack
17:50 <@Dune> all fixed in 0.7
17:50 < bridge> [freenode] <pet89> adding to that my ubuntu is at 0.6.4 :)
17:50 < bridge> [freenode] <pet89> ah ok
17:50 <@Dune> bots are ever-existing
17:53 <@Dune> or you mean the spoofed clients that fill servers?
17:55 < bridge> [freenode] <pet89> bots seen on some servers : abcdef names
17:55 < bridge> [freenode] <pet89> full-but-empty servers : 15/16 but 0 players
17:55 < bridge> [freenode] <pet89> few servers cause of ddos attack : almost all servers are "full but empty"
17:56 <@Dune> that's spoofed clients
17:56 < bridge> [freenode] <pet89> yes I guess
17:56 <@Dune> you can filter by version in the last 0.6 trunk, and only keep 0.6.5 server
17:57 <@Dune> 0.7.1release very very soon anyway and then you'll be encouraged to upgrade :)
17:57 < Oy> hm there's a problem with the winter_main in the old version in the second row from the bottom there was a small snow line 5 tiles wide. in the new tileset it's 6 tiles wide :(
17:58 < Oy> auto-reordering doesn't work for it
17:58 <@Dune> ouch
17:58 < Oy> either keep the old 5 tile wide thing
17:58 < Oy> or edit manually
17:58 <@Dune> why did it turn 6 tile wide
17:58 < Oy> no idea
17:59 <@Dune> probably revert to 5 tile I'd say
17:59 < Oy> yeah best
17:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix thoughts
17:59 < Oy> someone with graphic magic should do it :D

18:01 <@Dune> yes
18:01 <@Dune> they are all regional languages

18:08 < bridge> [freenode] <pet89> before I quit, I would inform you that 15/16 servers contain either abcdef names, either 0 players
18:08 <@Dune> pet89: we know, that is what 0.6.5 was for
18:08 <@Dune> we told you
18:08 < bridge> [freenode] <pet89> ok

19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> which one is better?
19:30 < Oy> no idea :)
19:30 < Oy> dunno why they changed the colour
19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> still looks like a cake with frosting
19:31 <@heinrich5991> LordSk: never saw it this way, wow :D
19:31 < Oy> looks more like the old desert colour
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah
19:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> now you can't unsee it ðŸ˜ƒ
19:32 <@Dune> well I don't read finnish too well heinrich5991
19:32 <@Dune> but it says that it can't be opened because someone untrusted made it
19:32 <@heinrich5991> yes, that's to be expected
19:32 <@Dune> and mac doesn't show a way to bypass it :/
19:32 <@heinrich5991> hold shift while opening or something like that
19:32 <@heinrich5991> or control
19:32 <@heinrich5991> or that mac-specific modifier
19:32 <@heinrich5991> then it shows the bypass button
19:33 < Oy> i think newest mac version just let you use thirdparty apps, when you allow it in settings...
19:34 <@heinrich5991> when you do that
19:34 <@Dune> err
19:35 <@heinrich5991> giant error screen? :)
19:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> 2. is the new one?

19:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yea it's better
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> apparently they called the first version bloody desert ðŸ˜„
19:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I'll go with the new one
19:37 <@Dune> heinrich5991: more like gf's bricked
19:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> will try to compile tw on mac... no promises if it will work.. updating xcode first
19:37 <@Dune> well teeworlds.exe runs (although no data so it shows default textures)
19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> sadly jungle_main isnt 0.7
19:39 <@heinrich5991> Fisico: you could wait until my cmake stuff is done, then you can do it in xcode natively :P
19:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> it has no 1 tile platforms
19:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> where do i get freetype for macos?
19:54 <@heinrich5991> compile it
19:54 <@heinrich5991> (that's how I did it)
19:55 <@heinrich5991> https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/temp/libfreetype.6.dylib
19:55 <@heinrich5991> or use that ^

19:55 <@heinrich5991> *linux
19:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok
19:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> btw.. dont use sdl 2.0.9 it has some weird bugs on windows.. dunno if this is also a mac problem
20:00 <@heinrich5991> Oy: can you try this? https://heinrich5991.de/teeworlds/temp/teeworlds-0.7.0-win64.zip
20:00 < minus> hm, someone still needs to fix downloads.teeworlds.com to do properly what it does
20:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Oy did u optimize winter main?
20:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I'm about to make a pr with all the gfx updated
20:02 < Oy> heinrich5991: sure, one mom
20:02 < Oy> Sonix no just used the one LordSK provided
20:04 <@heinrich5991> minus: what was the problem again?
20:04 < minus> there's not TLS cert for downloads.teeworlds.com; can't add a new one either
20:05 < minus> thinking about it, that doesn't make much sense since it shouldn't be using tls-sni-01
20:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> btw winter_main will change again in the future
20:05 < minus> (which doesn't work anymore)
20:05 < Oy> seems the zip is 3MB bigger than than what i did for 0.7.0
20:06 <@heinrich5991> do you statically link the standard library?
20:07 <@heinrich5991> I think my zip doesn't require you to install msvc runtime libraries(?)
20:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune yes i am really happy about the new broadcast
20:07 < Oy> hm dunno, just build with bam and run make_release
20:07 < Oy> heinrich5991: works
20:07 < minus> have you considered building linux binaries on alpine and just statically linking everything, including libc?
20:08 <@heinrich5991> nice
20:08 < Oy> heinrich5991: but don't use sdl 2.0.9
20:08 <@heinrich5991> minus: I just build them on ancient debian and it works everywhere
20:08 <@heinrich5991> Oy: ok, which version should I use?
20:08 <@heinrich5991> 2.0.8?
20:08 < Oy> i2.0.9 is buggy
20:08 < Oy> yeah
20:08 < minus> heinrich5991: question is: which solution is more terrible
20:08 <@heinrich5991> 'docker run -it --rm debian:oldstable-slim' is fairly easy ^^
20:09 < minus> terrible as in insecure
20:09 <@heinrich5991> what do you mean?
20:09 <@heinrich5991> I don't statically link stuff on ancient debian
20:10 < minus> actually it's obvious: dynamically linking does not have the update problematic static linking does
20:10 <@heinrich5991> Oy: also for mac?
20:11 < Oy> heinrich5991: no idea, just can confirm that 2.0.9 has a problem on windows
20:11 < Oy> someone with a mac should test it
20:11 <@heinrich5991> what is the problem (so we can reproduce it)?
20:12 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1693

20:21 < Oy> Sonix?
20:21 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: could you open it from a terminal to get some debug output?
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> the countryflags
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I am not sure from which path i should execute it lemme play around a lill

20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> cant get it to compile on mac... sdl librarys are mission
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> ready state is always green ðŸ˜„
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> *missing
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cant get it compile on windows because sdl @Fisico xd but on mac
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> windows sux
20:24 <@heinrich5991> Fisico: download it on https://libsdl.org/
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i did
20:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> put it in library
20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i think brew is more userfriednly than libsdl.org
20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Sonix: during warmup it is
20:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> @heinrich5991  error sdl.h is missing
20:25 <@heinrich5991> SDL.h or sdl.h?

20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 which makes sense because this path is invalid from where i executed the binary but i dont know how apps work and how they look up paths
20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> SDL.h
20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> and ft2build.h
20:26 <@heinrich5991> hmm
20:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> The data folder is in ``Contents/Resources/`` and the binary is in ``Contents/MacOS/``
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I can't really remember how i did it but i am pretty sure i used brew @Fisico i suggest trying it aswell
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> how is the ordner structure in your source folder?
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> teeworlds/other/sdl/include ?
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> please tell me if the updated gfx are displayed correctly
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> will try now
20:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> my server is online now with the latest version
20:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 should i build from source or should i wait until you fixed the graphics?
20:32 <@heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: I'm currently at loss as to what goes wrong
20:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so?
20:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I don't care i can build from source i can wait multiple days until you fixed it. I am here to help just tell me what you need.
20:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> How do you even create the .app file @heinrich5991 ? Is there a bam flag or a script somewhere in the repo? I never created a app for me it always produces pure binarys.
20:34 <@heinrich5991> it's my not-yet-published cmake addition to 0.7
20:34 <@heinrich5991> then it's make package_default or make package_dmg
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> did i miss something? I thought we still use bam :c
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is cmake pushing away bam soon?
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> If you want me to try and error a bit with the makefile feel free to send it to me
20:36 <@heinrich5991> in a sec, I'll put it into a github PR
20:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nice
20:36 <@heinrich5991> need to rebase it onto current master first
20:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Fisico are you german? I don't know the english word "ordner" nor do i understand your question sorry :c
20:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 you fokin git wizard o.O
20:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Fisico i am not sure if you were asking for that but thats how it looks like for me
20:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ```
20:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> $ ls other/sdl/
20:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> VERSION    sdl.lua
20:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ```
20:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
20:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I think brew just installed it into some generic location and i can use it everywhere
20:42 <@heinrich5991> Oy: want a big PR or one fore each (independent) commit?
20:44 <@heinrich5991> I'll do a big one. can split it up if you want
20:44 <@Dune> +1
20:46 < Oy> heinrich5991: one big is okay
20:48 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] heinrich5991 opened pull request #1730:  Add CMake (and a couple of other fixes) (master...pr_cmake) https://git.io/fpu1t
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Fisico how often does the fps spike occur? I couldn't reproduce it from current source

20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> And what happend to the scoreboard color? Is this a feature?
20:50 <@Dune> it's the ready_state
20:50 <@Dune> but it's not supposed to be green by default?
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @LordSk
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> What is a ready state?
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ready for what
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what is ready
20:50 <@Dune> something you enable when the game is paused or during warmup
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah what Dune said
20:50 <@Dune> it's a bit ugly during warmup though
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> you can use sv_player_ready_mode 1
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> who enables it? a user or a admin? What is it used for
20:51 <@Dune> oh it's opt-in LordSk?
20:51 <@Dune> user has a bind to enable it
20:51 <@Dune> it blocks resuming the game in some settings
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ``[5bfc4eba][Console]: No such command: sv_player_ready_mode.``
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah sv
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> woops nobody saw that
20:52 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/6e604402cabb7d260fd541e5dc80ebb3f52232d7/src/game/variables.h#L110
20:52 <@Dune> okay it's opt-in
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea i see
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so if it's disabled we should never see that green thing, @LordSk, even during warmup, right?
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> humm I'm not sure if we know if it is enabled or not tbh
20:53 <@Dune> need to try with a server wiht default settings
20:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I've not looked deeply into it yet, just implemented the color when applicable
20:54 <@Dune> maybe a green star right of the name would be smoother
20:55 <@Dune> idk if we ever see it when sv_player_ready_mode is disabled, that's my worry
20:55 < Oy> heinrich5991: is that pr ready to pull?
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its not working yet for mac Oy
20:56 <@heinrich5991> not really. the created mac bundle doesn't work
20:57 <@heinrich5991> as in: doesn't find the data directory
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> heinrich5991: could you tell me the git magic command agian to test your pr o.O ?
20:59 <@heinrich5991> git fetch https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds pull/1730/head
20:59 <@heinrich5991> git checkout FETCH_HEAD
20:59 < Oy> ok
20:59 < Oy> have to go soon anyway, maybe we find the solution till tomorrow :D
21:00 <@heinrich5991> okay :)
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ty
21:01 < Oy> todo: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1580 that needs to get merged and then search and fix bugs
21:01 <@heinrich5991> Oy: can I make a PR with everything but the last commit (that would be ready to merge)
21:02 <@heinrich5991> (we can also do that tomorrow if you prefer)
21:04 < Oy> either way is fine

21:18 <@heinrich5991> sure
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> What was that thing in the rules about no private messages to mods? ðŸ¤”
21:22 < minus> FYI teeworlds.com is now backed up (incl. DB dump) and is currently upgrading from jessie to stretch
21:26 <@heinrich5991> good job on the backup :)
21:26 <@heinrich5991> anyone taking bets whether it'll work? ^^
21:26 < minus> it dumps the files and the .sql with the DB is in there
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @guenstig werben that's about "no unsolicited PMs"
21:50 < minus> did teeworlds.com just die?
21:51 <@Dune> seems so
21:51 <@heinrich5991> I can't access it
21:51 < minus> i was just configuring certbot :<
21:52 < minus> Kottizen~ what happened
21:53 <@heinrich5991> if that's an actual server failure, you definitely did the backup at the right time
21:54 < minus> :D
21:54 < minus> maybe i caused it
21:54 < minus> did some (relatively) heavy disk io
21:54 < minus> i'm sure that the upgrade didn't fuck shit up because i rebooted afterwards and it worked fine for 15 minutes
23:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> heinrich5991: sowwy was afk getting some food :c but i tested it now
23:09 <@Dune> rip teeworlds.com
23:09 <@Dune> time to open a teeworlds myspace
