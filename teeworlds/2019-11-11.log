13:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> took a look into Twitch integration - now I don't look at it ever again
16:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> hey, can you tell me in which component the bottom right is rendered?
16:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> i mean ingame bottom right with teamscores
16:27 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> hud.cpp probably
16:58 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> thank you iLl check
17:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> how can i encode unicode characters again? xD
17:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> can anyone explain why this is not working as string "\uD83D\uDC41"
17:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> okay you encode like this \xE2\x9A\x99
17:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> but \xF0 \x9F\x91\x81 isn't working (showing no symbol)?
17:59 < Dune_> maybe it is not present in the font?
18:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> :/ and now?
18:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> guess i need to do an image
18:07 < Dune_> utf8 is a bad idea in generla
18:08 < Dune_> the settings/close buttons are not in many fonts
18:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> the close buttons are icons
18:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> i checked it
18:08 < Dune_> this is just some bandaid to the painful lack of regular artists :/
18:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> (I mean images)
18:08 < Dune_> Not the quit button
18:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> the 'X' button
18:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> I mean _some_ X buttons oO
18:10 < Dune_> UI()->DoLabel(&XText, "\xE2\x9C\x95", XText.h*ms_FontmodHeight, CUI::ALIGN_CENTER);
18:10 < Dune_> the quit button is *not* an image
18:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> i run into invalid format
18:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/9b22b2426daf71bac6078a2376544a96cd7f06b4/src/engine/client/graphics_threaded.cpp#L432
18:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> I don't understand why oO?!
18:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> Forget it, i know why: depth 8 wasn't set
