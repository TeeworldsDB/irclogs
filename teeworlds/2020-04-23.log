00:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> is there a console command for using the chat commands?
00:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @redix shouldn't it be the other way around?
00:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> oh, you mean server-side commands
00:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yes
00:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there isn't
00:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> atm you can fallback on `say` though
00:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> mostly for binding them to a key =\
00:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> depends on the server implementation ðŸ˜„
00:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't think any server will require the modern command protocol
00:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> true
00:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> only makes sense if your bind is something like `/login redix password`
00:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I remember someone leaked his password back in 0.6 once :D
00:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> or `/pause` in ddnet
00:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> oh yeah
00:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I used fudgy's settings.cfg to reproduce some bugs he had, and since then I've been accidentally sending /pauses in vanilla /shame
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yeah, leaking passwords happened quite often ðŸ˜„
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> i was hoping to get rid of the chat command spamming ðŸ˜„
11:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> @redix I was thinking about adding a command for calling chat commands, wasn't sure if it'd be too useful
21:20 < rand> ChillerDragon: your server is with 4 vs 4
21:27 < ChillerDragon> yikes thanks for the repor rand
21:33 < ChillerDragon> Yea as I suspected 0.7.5 changed the config format and my 0.7.4 config broke :/ also worth to be mentioned somewhere
21:34 < ChillerDragon> ./teeworlds_srv "sv_player_slots 16;sv_max_clients 64" # creates a srv with 16 ingame players in 0.7.4 and with 8 in 0.7.5
21:35 < ChillerDragon> order now matters probably caused by the new sv_max_client update without restart
21:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> which config format?
21:43 < ChillerDragon> sv_max_clients, sv_player_slots order matters
21:43 < ChillerDragon> it did not used to
21:44 < ChillerDragon> well format might be the wrong word
21:44 < ChillerDragon> but 0.7.3 configs might break in 0.7.4
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's bad :/
21:46 < ChillerDragon> it is unfortune but not too bad if even a nobo like me can figure it out in a few secs its oke and server still starts just player slots might be lower than expected
21:46 < ChillerDragon> but probably worth to be mentioned in the list of 0.7.4 traps :D
22:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> In would call that a bug and not intended behavior. is there like an issue saying: I want order to matter now in the configs, I guess not :0.
22:26 < ChillerDragon> yea no i did not say its a feature and i would not blame one for fixing this but it is not liek 0.7.5 is broken bcs of this
22:47 < ChillerDragon> Is there a simple way in tw to take blocking screenshot without using the threaded one or wait for the threaded screenshot to finish somehow
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what's your use case? ^^
22:54 < ChillerDragon> demo to video
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Only reading pixels is done in the rendering thread. The file handling happens in the main thread
22:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The main thread actually waits for the rendering thread
22:55 < ChillerDragon> https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1587675329.png
22:55 < ChillerDragon> my log says i took a zillion screenshots and the folder only holds a few
22:56 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/0a7d0fee7ca11ea3cfa1effd28a6aa06b5f50821/src/engine/client/graphics_threaded.cpp#L948
22:57 < ChillerDragon> i replaced that with ScreenshotDirect(m_aScreenshotName);
22:57 < ChillerDragon> I guess im not on the mainthread then
22:59 < ChillerDragon> OMG im soo stoopid it saves it under the same name because timestamp secs are not precise enough
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> That would still be in the main thread
23:02 < ChillerDragon> yea i got it now thanks i somehow expected it too be more complicated
23:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Depending on where `TakeScreenshot` is called you might get an unfinished image so better use `m_DoScreenshot = true;`
23:03 < ChillerDragon> thanks for the advice :)
