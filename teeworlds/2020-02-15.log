15:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Can maps contain extra data that can be retrieved by the server?
15:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> arbitrary data
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> like some string contained in the map.
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes, maps have envelopes where you can store author and comments
15:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> technically you can store anything in a map
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> cookie authentication
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or jwt token
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> not authentication, but more of authorization
19:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @jxsl13 the client does not send anything about the map back to the server, except for whether it needs to download it
19:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you cannot set a string or so that the client will play back to you
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> so, the only data that's retrievable is tue existance of a map, that can be used to encode data. https://github.com/jxsl13/zcatch/issues/61
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> binary encoding based on fake maps.
20:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if you're tracking users, you need to think about the gdpr
20:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @heinrich5991 are honeypots servers considered a bannable offense?
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> probably yes
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> what kind of honeypots?
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> servers with exact same config
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> thats what i wanted to ask
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> no provable malice though
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> do you know which one was there earlier?
20:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so account sniffing and s tuff
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's @Trafalgar Law's server and it says Trafalgar Law's server in the name
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> gametype?
20:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Marius> All the same
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> ah somebody is phising players
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Marius> Yesterday my server crashed my Multimap_Less Server and all thought it was my Server but they joined the fake srv
20:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Marius> Yesterday crashed my Multimap_Less Server and all thought it was my Server but they joined the fake srv
20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> 108.191.164.78:8302 is the fake server
20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the ping is very bad and the IP is different
20:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Marius> They actually use the same port as my server
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe add a rule to the masterservers, that you can't register when a server with the same name exist already?
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> nah you can go around this easily
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> with another masterserver
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes
20:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> don't need a rule for that anyway, no malice should be obvious
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the master server doesn't know about the servers' names currenty
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> currently*
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Rip unnamed server
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> make it an exception, like nameless tee
20:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's ugly imo ^^
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Add verified servers ðŸ™‚
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> or just ban honeypots
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> banned
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> thanks
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> should go away in the next hours
20:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Add CA system :p
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ðŸ˜„
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so i can't annoy anyone with MITM attacks :p
20:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Marius> Thanks @heinrich5991
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> well, teeworlds would need a https client for this, the game itself should obv. still run on tcp and udp directly
20:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> cas work without https
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I woudn't know how to implement it <.<
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol, that is not really clever to ban server for having he same name. as you have no proof if someone asks for you to ban the incorrect server while hosting their own server with the same name.
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the server had the person's name in its name
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> > [8:42 PM]  heinrich5991: do you know which one was there earlier?
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> names are not bound to accounts and nobody's property
20:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yet if you and someone else were to host a jxsl13's server, I know which to ban
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> "magic, right?"
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I would not care.
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> great
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as I do not call my server's that
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so the case is closed :)
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what about people faking servers that do not contain anyone's nicks?
20:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what about generic server names
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what are you concerned about, @jxsl13 ?
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm concerned about you people introducing arbitrary rules.
21:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> however you please
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> faking servers does have a security impact
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> sniffing server logins was done before, and we have already banned servers for that 5 years ago
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> same servers have an account system so you could phish accounts by faking servers
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> can you proof that the server sniffs login credentials?
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> very doubtful we'll ever have grey cases in those
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's obviously visible that that server is different when one looks at the ping
21:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't understand what you are trying to achieve here, @jxsl13
21:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> not everyone is a network expert like us
21:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I want that server unbanned, as it's been banned on asumptions
21:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and not on any facts
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if it's your server, present your case
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if not, ask the server owner to do it please
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Law asked for it and his name was in the server name
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> especially as there is not proof in any form and nobody has any right to claim any nicknames, what's the basic system of teeworlds
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's a flaw in the system, not in the people hosting servers.
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's not my server.
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thus you try to avoid the issue, what if I hosted the same server.
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'd simply bring this forth, just to bring up this issue.
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> > what if I hosted the same server.
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> > if it's your server, present your case
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> if I fake your zCatch server @jxsl13 would you care?
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> let me startup a clone
21:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no, as you don't have my ranking data
21:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> so nobody would care
21:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> but I will receive your admin probably from tweef
21:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and what would you do?
21:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> login in your server
21:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I have logs and can simply change the login
21:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> wow
21:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> tell m ypeople to favourite their server, wher ethey ar emods and that would get you nothing
21:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> arbitrary ban on assumptions
21:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's what this is
21:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> banning random people, changing some values maybe gravity, maybe you aren't online on this day?
21:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'd get informed
21:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as I am available via discord
21:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> damage is already done at this point
21:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> happens
21:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> same as when a mod tells their password to someone
21:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I don't know if you have any database commands
21:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> like deleting some players stats
21:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> for sure I don't
21:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> having database commands would be dumb
21:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes
21:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no backups, no pity
21:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> do you get a notification if somebody unknown logs into admin?
21:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no
21:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe i don't do much, except being unbannable
21:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I don't see your point, it's damage that's avoidable with a little bit of intelligence
21:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> favoriting your servers
21:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> you never want random people being able to do anything with your stuff unerpermited
21:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> thats rule #1 on the internet
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> getting ones server banned falls under that?
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> randomly
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe it's not much damage in your case, but what about other servers?
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and faking a server is a clear phishing case
21:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'd say it's a case that tries to get players from those server's, not necessarily their data
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there have been ton os these cases in 0.6
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> tons of
21:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and nobody cared
21:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and getting players is not an offense, is it?
21:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> banning servers on assumtions, that's all this is.
21:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> assumptions*
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> do you think that the banned server was not the copy?
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no, as it's missing the player data
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> which is obviously visible by times, when the player plays there
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> then everything seems to be fine
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we made the right judgement according to you, as to which server was the copy
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> no, it wa snot a copy?
21:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> oh. I ment which server had the server name later
21:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> *meant
21:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> since when is having the same name an offense?
21:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I was trying to establish the other thing first
21:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I understand the problem, but this is introducing arbitrary judgement on solely assumptions
21:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> can the masterserver proof which server was there first?
21:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as anyone could tell you which server was first
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> assumptions
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Marius> You should also know that my server was first
21:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I know that it was there first, it's not exactly about your server, it's a case that might change the judgement in further cases like these heavily
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as judgement is done based on assumptions here, not on exact proof
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if it's an unknown server
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> any somone said that somone else is faking their server
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> who would you trust
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there's a third option there: don't ban any of these if you don't know
21:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I would say this is always the option, as currently this is based on assumptions that it's a phishing server
21:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> by just having the same name
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you just said that we have a consensus that this was the fake
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is having the same name already considered being fake?
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> since when?
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if it's such a unique name
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't know, we had such a case before
21:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> search the IRC channel logs
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Marius> It happend already with L# Servers
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what is considered unique
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> people's judgement
21:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> mushy definition
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> mushy judgement in my opinion.
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> as no proof
21:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, it's fake cuz "unique" same name
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is tw.com down?
21:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> oh, I'm dumb, teworlds
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Marius> ðŸ˜‚
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=rules/server_rules
21:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> should be updated then
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I wonder how the case will be handled if 3 people tell you that one server is the fake and another 5 people tell you the other server is fake, while pressuring you annoyingly. This will seemingly be fun to watch.
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> And I will happily say I told you ðŸ˜„
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but currently the game doesn't have enough players to have such problems, yet.
21:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Great, let's just disagree here then ðŸ™‚
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah.
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm fine with that.
21:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> just wanted to present my point.
21:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it would be better received without condescension
21:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, I find that judgement arbitrary and baseless.
21:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> still, no condescension please
21:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> same name -> ban
21:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we presented the reasoning
21:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> there is no unban function and this server is banned forever
21:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there is an unban function. contact the admins
21:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> no, you lying
21:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ok
21:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's how servers have always been unbanned, @Assa
21:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> assa is trolling
21:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> maybe
21:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *probably
21:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *assably
21:44 < rand> poor guy that wanted genuinely to host a server that appeared to have the exact same name and gametype 
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> unnames server - dm
21:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> unnamed server - dm
21:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think the problem is more of how do you proof who was there first if the server is not that well known. Maybe someone had the same name, as they call themselves the same. If teeworlds for example had 3million players and 60000 players. and you had this exact same problem.
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> how would the judgement be.
21:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> could probably not be done manually then
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what is unique if someoe else has the same ingame nick, as it's a character from One Piece a widely known anime.
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> uniqueness is not objective
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> anyway, case closed.
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> uniqueness can be measured if you want
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> statistics is a thing
21:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but I don't want to do that, that sounds more annoying than it is worth
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> e.g. ddnet servers do some sort of closeness computation on nicks
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> "objective"
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> googling a nickname is enough of a uniqueness test
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> test my nick
21:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> x)
21:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and google Trafalgar Law ðŸ˜„
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Marius> Well Law's could be stand too for the "Law"
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Marius> ðŸ˜‰
21:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Marius> But true the name is from Trafalgar Law
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> if you google my real name, you won't find me
23:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> if you google Essigautomat however, you find all my gaming accounts, old profile pictures and stuff
23:41 < minus> Essiggurkenautomat sounds like a good name for a band
23:49 < Dune> what does it mean? :
23:50 < Dune> :)
23:50 <@heinrich5991> vending machine for pickles
23:56 <@heinrich5991> was that disappointing? ^^
