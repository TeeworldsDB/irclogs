18:17 < io_> happy new year
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> happy new year y'all :)
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> minus: yeah I realized punbb sucks on that side. Looked into the extensions and they're an absolute pain
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the [teeworlds] prefix is the bot adding it to specify which discord/thing they come from probably (here there is only one, teeworlds discord)
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I can remove that prefix if you want, it was from the time it was also bridged to freenode
18:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I'd be in favor of that
