02:02 < Maimer> matricks you there?
02:02 < Maimer> minus?
08:46 <@minus> Maimer?
11:11 < ghost91> hi
11:11 < ghost91> heinrich5991: 
11:11 < ghost91> are you here?
11:14 <@minus> prolly at school
13:35 < ghost91> minus: should we still document compiling for 0.5.2 and earlier?
13:35 < ghost91> or should we just remove that?
14:09 <@minus> remove
16:50 < Maimer> minus
16:50 < ghost91> minus:
16:50 < ghost91> ghost91: minus: should we still document compiling for 0.5.2 and earlier?
16:50 < ghost91> ghost91: or should we just remove that?
16:51 < Maimer> he said remove
16:51 < Lisiro> can't you keep the page somewhere
16:51 < Lisiro> with a "compiling outdated versions" or something?
17:26 < heinrich5991> minus: university it is!
17:26 < heinrich5991> :)
17:26 < heinrich5991> I vote for Lisiro's version
17:44 < Maimer> matricks
17:44 < Maimer> hook us up with the D bot
17:45 <@matricks> D?
17:45 < Maimer> https://www.quakenet.org/news/305-d-new-network-service-channel-statistics
17:46 < Maimer> it was just announced yesterday
17:46 < Maimer> but we need a channel op to turn it on
17:47 < EastByte> matricks: when do we leave quakenet? :D
17:48 < Maimer> why would we leave
17:49 < EastByte> well
17:49 < EastByte> quakenet sucks
17:49 < Maimer> where would you rather be?
17:50 < BotoX> pls no public tracking for this channel
17:50 < EastByte> there have been discussions about switching to freenode some time ago
17:50 < Maimer> BotoX you dont want the D?
17:50 < Maimer> the D bot that is
17:50 < BotoX> don't force it down my throat
17:50 < BotoX> pls no
17:50 < BotoX> It's just a damn network
17:51 < BotoX> If the channel is here then leave it here, the network is stable - it's fine.
17:51 < EastByte> >is stable
17:51 < BotoX> It's pretty stable
17:52 <@matricks> good enough, enough to not move
17:52 < EastByte> yes, there are less netsplits then before
17:52 < EastByte> but the ipv6 node still doesn't work
17:52 < EastByte> (properly)
17:52 < Maimer> so what are your thoughts on the bot, matricks?
17:52 <@matricks> Maimer: meh
17:52 < heinrich5991> the other networks are not so much better that you should think about moving
17:52 < BotoX> clearly we should move to rizon （ ´・ω・｀）
17:53 < ghost91> minus: I left it in, because obviously there are still people who need it
17:59 < Learath2> ipv6.quakenet.org just keeps dying
18:03 <@matricks> stop using alpha features? :/
18:04 < Learath2> znc verybroken doesnt want to use the ipv4 interface
18:05 <@matricks> fix znc?
18:05 <@matricks> ipv6 support isn't good enough reason to switch I would say
18:10 < BotoX> >ipv6
18:10 < BotoX> >alpha
18:10 < BotoX> wow
18:10 <@matricks> quakenets ipv6 support is alpha trail stuff
18:10 <@matricks> not ipv6 itself
18:12 < ghost91> minus: http://pastebin.com/tJdBQ8fS
18:12 < ghost91> I did not include mingw stuff, because i don’t know how that’s done
18:13 < ghost91> (this is only the code for the content)
18:16 < ghost91> heinrich5991: I think it’s ok to drop the framework support now.
18:16 < ghost91> It is possible to install sdl via ports without the X11 stuff
18:16 < ghost91> sdl has no dependencies then
18:16 < heinrich5991> if you say so. I'm not really familiar with the os x stuff
18:16 < heinrich5991> ghost91: could you try to adapt the compiling everything guide then?
18:16 < ghost91> I did alread ;)
18:16 < ghost91> y
18:16 < heinrich5991> oh nice
18:16 < heinrich5991> :)
18:17 < ghost91> that’s what I just highlighted minus for
18:17 < ghost91> (I hope the linux and windows stuff is correct :D)
18:40 < ghost91> miiiiiinus
18:40 < ghost91> minus
18:40 < ghost91> :)
18:49 < ghost91> well, I need to go, cya ;)
20:08 < Madara> Sry, I've forgotten in which file the lasercolor is hardcoded. May someone be so kind and tell it to me?
20:08 < Madara> :D
20:09 < heinrich5991> Madara: src/game/client/components/items.cpp
20:12 < Madara> Thanks :)
20:38 < Madara> Can I change a vec4 like a normal variable?
20:38 < Madara> Coz I'm too newby, I have to ask...
20:39 <@minus> a vec4 is a normal variable
20:39 <@minus> as normal as any variable
20:39 < Madara> Hmm...
20:39 <@minus> it's a vector with 4 elements
20:39 < Madara> Okay.. Is RenderLaser always called when a laser is fired?
20:40 < Madara> 	srand((unsigned int)time(0));
20:40 < Madara> 	rand();
20:40 < Madara> 	int rnd_color=(rand()%4);
20:40 < Madara> 	std::cout << rnd_color;
20:40 < Madara> 	vec4 OuterColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
20:40 < Madara> 	if(rnd_color==0){OuterColor(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);}
20:40 < Madara> 	if(rnd_color==1){OuterColor(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);}
20:41 < Madara> 	if(rnd_color==2){OuterColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);}
20:41 < Madara> 	if(rnd_color==3){OuterColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);}
20:41 < Madara> What's the problem with that?
20:41 < Madara> I want to change the color of the laser every time I shoot, or someone else.
20:42 <@minus> the problem is that you don't know C++
20:42 < Madara> Hmm..
20:42 <@minus> if vec4 does not implement operator() you're doing it wrong
20:42 <@minus> OuterColor = vec4(...);
20:42 <@minus> in the ifs
20:43 < Madara> oh...
20:44 < Madara> GREAT.
20:44 < Madara> thx. it's working now <3
20:44 < Madara> But I should learn C++ more and more :c
20:44 < Madara> Bye
20:44 <@minus> C++ is hard
20:44 <@minus> also, using srand() more than once is probably no good idea
20:45 < Madara> Okay. gonna fix that.
20:45 <@minus> the way you do it you will get a different color every second
20:45 <@minus> multiple shots fired in the same second will have the same color
20:46 < Madara> Idea to fix this?
20:46 <@minus> remove the srand
20:46 <@minus> also the first rand(); that's useless
20:47 < Madara> Hm... But now the Laser changes the color _in_ the shot.
20:47 < Madara> Is it possible to change the color only when one laser isfired?
20:48 <@minus> probably, you'd have to save the color with the shot fired
20:48 < Madara> okay.
20:48 < Madara> Gonna do that when I have more time. Anyway big thanks from me to you, spending your time helping a noob.
20:49 < Madara> Byee
21:45 < ghost91> minus: ?
21:45 <@minus> !
21:46 < ghost91> http://pastebin.com/tJdBQ8fS
21:47 < ghost91> i made some changes to the linux/windos parts, too, but mingw is not yet included
22:32 <@minus> ghost91: will add some other time
22:32 <@minus> night
