19:58 <@heinrich5991> minus: website returns a https oscp error for me
19:59 < Henningstone> for me not, funny, somebody else told me the same in skype just now
19:59 < Henningstone> But I don't have the smallest problem
19:59 <@heinrich5991> Henningstone: what browser do you use?
19:59 <@minus> i do get that error too
19:59 <@minus> on firefox
19:59 < Henningstone> I use vivaldi
19:59 <@minus> strangely enough i have OCSP disabled
20:00 < Henningstone> My friend who just got the same problem has ff aswell
20:00 <@heinrich5991> does teeworlds.com do ocsp stapling otherwise?
20:00 <@minus> i think so
20:00 <@heinrich5991> well, maybe the server sends a malformed ocsp thing
20:01 <@heinrich5991> ddnet.tw still works, which is also certified by startssl
20:02 <@heinrich5991> a) I only have firefox users as friends
20:02 <@heinrich5991> b) it only seems to fail on firefox
20:03 <@heinrich5991> ssllabs doesn't find anything fishy
20:03 < Henningstone> When I try with firefox it also fails; same error
20:04 <@heinrich5991> ok, now it works
20:04 <@heinrich5991> minus: did you change anything?
20:04 <@minus> disabled OCSP stapling and reloaded
20:04 <@minus> then it worked
20:04 <@minus> reenabled and it still works
20:04 <@heinrich5991> mh weird
20:04 <@heinrich5991> but I hope chromium checks stapled ocsp responses
20:04 <@minus> tested with openssl s_client and the stapled OCSP looked good
20:14 <@minus> i'd love to run some monitoring against teeworlds stuff, but i have absolutely no idea what
