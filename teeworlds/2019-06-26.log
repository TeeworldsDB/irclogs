13:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> why doesn't default teeworlds not support teleports? In a lot of games they are just a usefull tool
13:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> *Why doen't teeworlds support teleport Oo whats wrong with me
13:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Sure they are usefull but they are not used for the vanilla gametype. And I don't think that they wpuld fit from what I saw in fly mods.
14:03 < rand> or jump booster
14:03 < rand> could wind be emulated through tune parameters ? (wind as in worms)
15:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> not via tune params
15:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> but in general it can be simulated
15:44 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> the client just wouldn't like strong winds
16:00 < rand> right, any gravity tuning will also apply to player
16:00 < rand> (and rightÂ² about strong wind)
16:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> you can handle gravity seperarte for  each player
16:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> because you can send them different tuinings ðŸ˜ƒ
16:08 < rand> but, since there is a bit of prediction on the trajectory of each player, that is the same difficulty as strong wind
16:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> no
16:08 < rand> but, it is smooth for the client own position
16:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> the client can predict the gravity, since you are sending the tuning parameters
16:08 < rand> I was thinking about wind only on grenade
16:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> then yes ðŸ˜„
16:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> on the gravity: the client would have problems predicting other players gravity, if its different
16:09 < rand> the gravity can be different per client, but each client will apply the same gravity on every player (until the server says nope)
16:09 < rand> yes
16:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes
16:10 < rand> I finally end up to what you were saying x)
16:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> you can solve this with multimaps
16:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> each multimap has its own gravity
16:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <WsY[FU]?> But why
16:12 < rand> what is a multimap ?
16:17 < rand> btw, I was wondering why client K/D info was reseting on zcatch (on the server I'm used to play)
16:17 < rand> is it because of hackish way to change skin color ?
16:19 < rand> does the SV_CHANGESKIN solve this issue ?
16:29 < redix> in 0.7.3 the K/D is hardly ever reset =\ actually it should reset on client enter or leave but it only does in demos right now
16:32 < redix> but when the stats are fixed they don't work with the current zcatch implemantation anymore. SV_CHANGESKIN can fix this issue... they should update the server
16:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> I don't know why zCatch breaks it
16:40 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> And zCatch uses the hackish way of changing skins, even a better way exists
16:41 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> what is a multimap? I can show you if you want
16:43 < redix> the skinchange was introduced in 0.7.3
16:43 < redix> zcatch is still on 0.7.2
16:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes and you can do a downwards compatible skinchange
19:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe this question is stupid, but how do i get an Editor instance on the server side?
19:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> when searching for Editor i never find a place where its initalized
19:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> m_pEditor = Kernel()->RequestInterface<IEditor>();
19:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> found it ^^
22:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> A feature I really miss: Ban people from voting.
