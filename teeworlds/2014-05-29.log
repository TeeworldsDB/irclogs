11:44 < Madara_> Hello Guys.
12:36 < heinrich5991> hello Madara_
13:01 < Madara_> Hey heinrich5991 xD
13:03 < Madara_> Sry as always i am _the_ programer noob.
13:04 < Madara_> Which values must be assigned to a MACRO_CONFIG_INT
13:04 < Madara_> ?
13:05 < EastByte> #define MACRO_CONFIG_INT(Name,ScriptName,Def,Min,Max,Save,Desc)
13:06 < EastByte> afk
13:06 < heinrich5991> where Def is the default
14:14 < Madara_> Thanks EastByte and heinrich5991... Is there also a MACRO_CONFIG_FLOAT?
14:14 < heinrich5991> no, but depending  on what you want, you could try tunings
14:16 < Madara_> Okay.
14:17 < Madara_> Is there anything else than STR and INT?
14:17 < Madara_> Just to know, don't need it anyway.
14:28 < heinrich5991> Madara_: no, only STR and INT
14:28 < Madara_> Okay, good to know :c
14:28 <@minus> can always parse a string
14:47 < heinrich5991> have you seen that truecrypt story?
14:47 < EastByte> I guess we all have seen it
14:48 <@minus> "story"?
14:48 < heinrich5991> well, I wonder how this will end
14:48 < heinrich5991> it's certainly not completed yet IMO
14:48 <@minus> stopped using truecrypt anyway
14:49 < EastByte> ya already switched to bitlocker
14:49 < heinrich5991> :(
14:49 < heinrich5991> used TC for my external drive for win/lin compatiblity
14:49 < EastByte> ^
14:49  * minus shrugs and contiues trying to understand wavelets from wikipedia
14:49 < heinrich5991> not sure whether bitlocker is any better though
14:49 < EastByte> it is NOT
14:49 <@minus> LUKS!
14:50 < heinrich5991> LUKS supports truecrypt volumes btw
14:50 < heinrich5991> (just saying)
14:50 < heinrich5991> or rather, cryptsetup supports it
14:50 <@minus> interesting
14:51 < heinrich5991> cryptestup open --type tcrypt <device> <name>
15:13 < EastByte> https://gist.github.com/ValdikSS/c13a82ca4a2d8b7e87ff
15:13 < EastByte> which assumption do you expect?
16:18 <@minus> man
16:19 < EastByte> man man
16:19 <@minus> the emails that arrive for forum@teeworlds.com make less sense than spam
16:19 <@minus> I want to get drunk on the game teeworlds.cz. Who is the owner of this game and how many players are here and that brings possibility to buy VIP Thank you for the euro
16:19 < EastByte> eh okay
18:17 < Madara_> lolol
18:32 < Madara_> Small question:
18:32 < Madara_> What happens if a float for a color is over .10f?
18:32 < Madara_> *1.0f
18:33 <@minus> your computer will explode
18:34 <@minus> it will either mess up calculations or just be clipped to 1.0
18:37 < Madara_> Shit!!!
18:37 < Madara_> Using my smartphone now to chat on IRC!
18:37 < Madara_> minus, it _implodes_
19:54 < Madara_> What's the 3rd Value of DoButton_CheckBox
19:54 < Madara_> What should it do?
19:56 < EastByte> int DoButton_CheckBox(const void *pID, const char *pText, int Checked, const CUIRect *pRect);
19:56 < EastByte> should be checked true/false
19:57 < Madara_> Okay.
19:57 < Madara_> Somehow I have a failure in my head anyway :D
19:58 < Madara_> So if it's true, the cross will be in the field?
19:58 < EastByte> I think so
19:58 < heinrich5991> check the function
19:59 < heinrich5991>  309         if(Checked)
19:59 < heinrich5991>  310                 RenderTools()->SelectSprite(SPRITE_MENU_CHECKBOX_ACTIVE);
19:59 < heinrich5991>  311         else
19:59 < heinrich5991>  312                 RenderTools()->SelectSprite(SPRITE_MENU_CHECKBOX_INACTIVE);
20:47 < Madara__> Thx My button works now.
