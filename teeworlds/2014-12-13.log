01:17 < timmeeeeee> hi guys, does some1 know the function, that will be called when the map is changing from where i can access to gamecontext?
10:20 <@minus> matricks: lrn2autojoin :(
10:20 <@minus> matricks: what's your opinion on this? https://github.com/SirCmpwn/rust-poc
10:20 <@minus> and heinrich5991 too, and anyone else knowing rust
11:04 <@matricks> minus: dunno what he is trying to say
11:04 <@minus> nevermind
11:05 <@minus> i overlooked that he's using a c++ preprocessor
11:05 <@matricks> oh :)
11:05 <@minus> i was assuming rust itself had #include
11:05 <@minus> which would be incredibly silly
11:06 <@matricks> I think it actually has
11:06 <@minus> Oo
11:07 <@matricks> my internet is acting up :/
11:07 <@minus> you still on 10/10?
11:07 <@matricks> yeah
11:08 <@matricks> there seem to be a macro that includes another file as a string/datablob
11:08 <@minus> we have 30/30 at work now, fiber. having so much upload speed is nice, though it's not really fast. also it costs over 500€ per month
11:08 <@minus> hm, ok, that can actually make sense
11:08 <@matricks> I miss my old appartment I had like 9 years ago..
11:09 <@matricks> 100/100
11:09 <@matricks> static ip
11:09 <@matricks> 60 euro / month
11:10 <@matricks> include! : include the Rust expression in the given file
11:10 <@matricks> include_str! : include the contents of the given file as a string
11:10 <@matricks> include_bin! : include the contents of the given file as a binary blob
11:11 <@matricks> you can do some weird shit with it if you want, but not recommended :)
11:22 <@minus> useful if you want to embed some binary file in your executable
11:22 <@matricks> yeah
11:23 <@minus> 100/100 for 60€ would be lovely :D
11:23 <@matricks> I do that in demos but in c++
11:23 <@minus> yeah
11:23 <@matricks> bin2c stuff :)
11:23 <@matricks> bam does it as well
11:23 <@matricks> it embedds a couple of script files into the exe
11:25 <@matricks> or stuff like this
11:25 <@matricks> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25505275/include-resource-file-into-rust-code
11:30 <@minus> ! are macros?
11:30  * minus np: Firefox, Tip, Phenomena - A Final Hyperbase - Enigma (aka musiklinjen)
11:30 <@matricks> yeah
17:49 < tomew> hi, what packet do i need for compiling teeworlds on linux? python & bam already installed and the other ones on tw faq does not exists
