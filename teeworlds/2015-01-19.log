18:03 < morphles> is there a way to always show all currently owned weapons and ammo, in numbers?
18:03 < morphles> also having hp and armor use one symbol and numbers would be preferable
18:15 < cris272> morphles: it's not possible with official client, i think there is a custom client (maybe gamer client) who show numbers
18:16 < cris272> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=6279
18:16 < morphles> its still lame
18:16 < morphles> shooters show not only current weapon
18:17 < cris272> well, there is 3 weapons, it's not hard to remenber what weapon you have
18:17 < morphles> ie wrasow, shows all weapons you have and how much amo you have, and which is active, also where switching left/right in weapon list will get you
18:17 < morphles> well its 5
18:18 < cris272> but you always have hammer and pistol
18:18 < morphles> yes, but if I have only shotgun switching next, gives me hammer and not launcher
18:18 < morphles> so i would rather switch prev
18:19 < morphles> I see no reason why such info can not be show
18:19 < morphles> there is plenty of space
18:19 < cris272> ah yes, personaly i switch with 1,2,3,4,5
18:19 < morphles> instead of using one icon for each hp/arm use it for useful info
18:19 < morphles> still
18:19 < cris272> so i have't this problem
18:19 < morphles> pressign dead keys...
18:19 < morphles> still seems like a problem
18:20 < morphles> additionally there is no autoswitch to best on out, which also most shooters have
18:20 < cris272> i dont press dead key because i remenber what weapon i have :D
18:20 < morphles> and you remember if you have amo?
18:20 < cris272> there is no "best weapon"
18:20 < morphles> yeah there is no but still empty clicks is stupid
18:21 < morphles> though granted these might be noob problems
18:21 < morphles> still 3d shooters like wrasow or xonotic do not have them
18:22 < morphles> run out of shutgut it auto swithes at furtheres weapon slot, you click shoot you get rocket instead of shells, still does the job!
18:22 < morphles> while click gets you killed :)
18:24 < morphles> also it seems they skip empty weapons which is again very sensible thing to do
18:27 < cris272> yeah, i think there is a topic about this on teeworlds's forum, but i can't find it
