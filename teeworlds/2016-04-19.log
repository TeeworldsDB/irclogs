21:31 < Dunedune> Hey \ottizen 
21:31 < \ottizen> Hey Dunedune 
21:32 < Dunedune> I've been written to by some guy asking stuff about you and your "City" 0.5.4 stuff
21:32 <@minus> hey Dunedune and \ottizen
21:32 < \ottizen> Hey minus 
21:32 < Dunedune> are you ok with that stuff or you don't want to be bothered with it anymore?
21:32 < Dunedune> I forgot what was your stance on that
21:32 < \ottizen> Dunedune: I don't mind people using it or modifying the code, but I probably can't answer any of the potential questions that might arise
21:33 < Dunedune> Oh, so it's open source?
21:33 < \ottizen> I can't remember... Heh. At first, it wasn't, but if I recall correctly I released both binaries and source code at some point.
21:33 < Dunedune> This guy has contacted me asking if I know you and if I could get the sources
21:34 < \ottizen> Ah... Sorry, I don't have the sources any longer. :/
21:34 < Dunedune> He says he's a fan had a lot of fun on it on 0.5 blabla
21:34 < Dunedune> ah, alright
21:34 < \ottizen> (nor the binaries)
21:34 < Dunedune> eh, alright then
21:34 < Dunedune> the matter is settled, thanks :)
