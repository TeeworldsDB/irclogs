00:12 < Dunedune> minus: can't you just write the equations of the polygon? what is n?
07:40 <@minus> matricks: the more difficult problem, finding a point
07:40 <@minus> there is an algorithm to find the kernel in O(n), so it must be possible
08:39 <@matricks> but that is super simple
08:40 <@matricks> I can do it in O(1)
08:40 <@matricks> suck it
08:40 <@matricks> take the first line, take the middle point and nudge it with epsilon inside 
08:40 <@matricks> done
08:41 <@matricks> did I cheat?
08:42 <@minus> what
08:43 <@matricks> you wanted to find a point inside a polygon right?
08:51 <@minus> inside the kernel
08:51 <@minus> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Star-kernel.svg
08:52 <@matricks> is the red area the kernel?
08:53 <@matricks> and the kernel is all inside the cutting planes
08:54 <@matricks> okey, I have an idea on how todo it :)
08:54 <@matricks> no, I have not
08:55 <@matricks> and O(n) you said..
08:57 <@matricks> minus: btw, waiting for my new phone :)
09:01 <@matricks> minus: got hold of a OnePlus One :)
11:44 < heinrich5991> "Is the performance counter monotonic (non-decreasing)? Yes"

11:45 < heinrich5991> the teeworlds code documents this differently
11:45 <@matricks> I've seen it go backwards so
11:45 <@matricks> probably fixed in later windows
11:47 <@matricks> http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=106
11:47 <@matricks> more info
11:54 < heinrich5991> thanks
12:33 < Dune> matricks: hellu
12:33 <@matricks> HARRO!
12:34 < Dune> since you use both bam and sublime text, would you happen to have syntax highlighting files for the build system output? :>
12:34 <@matricks> nope
12:34 < Dune> how, okay
12:34 <@matricks> didn't know you could highlight the output
12:34 < Dune> in ST3 it's much easier to do
12:35 < Dune> in bam.sublime-build
12:35 < Dune> you can add a  	"syntax": "Packages/Scheme/bam.tmLanguage", line
12:36 < Dune> I copy pasted the C++ .tmLanguage file, looks very colourful, bit too much
12:36 < Dune> but I have time to kill so it's ok
12:36 <@matricks> I run ST2
12:36 < Dune> ow
12:37 < Dune> I've read it's still possible but there is some work to do
12:38 < Dune> ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16937330/highlight-build-output-panel-of-sublime-text-2 )
14:12 <@minus> matricks: the solution was rather tricky. there's a paper from '79 describing how to do it (getting the kernel)
14:12 <@matricks> hehe
14:15 < Dune> minus: is that an abstract interpretation problem?
14:40 <@minus> not quite sure whaat you mean, but i think no
17:40 < Dune> wuhu, done it o/ http://i.imgur.com/k0043cS.png
19:09 < Learath2> Dunedune: uhm I've been trying to get it to highlight properly for like an hour now would you care to share ? :D
19:19 <@minus> monokai console, nice
19:43 <@matricks> Dunedune: coo'
20:14 < nameless_tee97>  
20:14 <@minus>  to you too
20:14 < nameless_tee97> How do I change my name?
20:15 < heinrich5991> nameless_tee97: /nick <new_nick>
20:15 < nameless_tee97> Ah right
20:20 < heinrich5991> hi Pathos =)
20:26 <@minus> oh god
20:26 <@minus> i thought i'd go build opencv-git with python3 support
20:26 <@minus> i forgot that the opencv git repo is several hundred megabytes in size
21:06 < dtw_> :D
