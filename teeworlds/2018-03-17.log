15:46 < jxsl13> any sql experts here :D?
15:47 < jxsl13> https://i.imgur.com/93tyM2b.png 
15:47 < pinkieval> hmm?
15:47 < jxsl13> I have git cTick = connected tick and the actual tick
15:47 < jxsl13> got*
15:48 < jxsl13> and I want all the rows with the minimum distance at one exact pTick
15:49 < jxsl13> like row 1, 5,9
15:50 <@minus> jxsl13: ORDER BY (cTick - pTick) ASC?
15:51 < jxsl13> dist is actually the distance
15:51 <@minus> oh
15:51 < jxsl13> but sadly didnt work
15:51 < jxsl13> or :O
15:52 < jxsl13> wait
15:52 <@minus> you want the rows with smallest dist for each distinct pTick?
15:52 < jxsl13> yeah
15:52 < pinkieval> SELECT DISTINCT TOP 1 dist FROM table ORDER BY dist
15:52 < pinkieval> er wait no
15:52 < jxsl13> prink stackoverflow :D?
15:53 < pinkieval> SELECT DISTINCT TOP 1 pTick FROM table ORDER BY dist
15:53 < jxsl13> pinkieval *
15:53 < jxsl13> sqlite*
15:53 <@minus> paste a .sql script with DDL & DML somewhere
15:53 <@minus> sqlite? good fucking luck
15:53 < jxsl13> x)
15:54 < jxsl13> https://pastebin.com/npcFhvmh
15:54 < jxsl13> that's the stuff for now :O
15:55 <@minus> that's not DDL+DML tho
15:55 < jxsl13> sqlite db -> https://files.johnbehm.de/share/isG4760l
15:56 <@minus> still not exactly what i asked for
15:56 < jxsl13> table structure?
15:56 <@minus> but it works
15:56 < jxsl13> is in the db ._.
15:57 <@minus> i had intended to throw the data at postgres
15:57 <@minus> because postgres is king
15:59 < pinkieval> minus: ever heard of some quote about a cannon and a fly?
15:59 <@minus> nope
15:59 <@minus> but i've heard about cannons and sparrows
16:00 < jxsl13> https://files.johnbehm.de/share/xtMHQWAn
16:00 < pinkieval> oh right, that one
16:00 < jxsl13> mysql dump, hopefully postgres takes it and there is nothing mysql preproitary stuff ._.
16:01 <@minus> what exactly are you tring to find out, jxsl13?
16:01 < jxsl13> assiciate every tick/ClientID with a nickname
16:01 <@minus> but i already said the sqlite db works too :<
16:01 < jxsl13> associate*
16:01 <@minus> what for?
16:02 < jxsl13> to know the person moving the character :D
16:02 < jxsl13> as adding that information to every line would not be wise :c
16:02 < pinkieval> SELECT * FROM table GROUP BY pTick HAVING MIN(dist);
16:02 <@minus> you want to join the player name onto each input from playerinput?
16:02 < jxsl13> yep
16:03 <@minus> if you have influence on how the data is generated i strongly suggest you generate a unique ID on joining the game and use that to associate actions
16:03 < pinkieval> yeah
16:04 < jxsl13> ok :'C
16:07 <@minus> because then you can just select from actions join players using (id)
16:07 < jxsl13> thanks for the tipp tho :D
16:07 <@minus> bonus: it's much faster
16:07 < jxsl13> true that
