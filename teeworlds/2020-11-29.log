01:42 < Fungus> Hello
01:43 < Fungus> Has anyone gotten tw to work on a raspi?
01:43 < Fungus> well, It does work, but its terribly slow
01:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you probably mean the client, right?
01:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the server ran smoothly for me
01:46 < Fungus> client yes
01:46 < Fungus> I doubt the server will eff up given that its just a daemon
01:47 < Fungus> I'll try building it from scratch
01:49 < Fungus> should it not work though? I thought tw was low req
01:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> fungus: ctrl+shift+d+g to check what's going slow
01:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> (if you're not sure it's fps)
01:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can see framerate drops if you use that ingame
01:55 < Fungus> It's even slow out of game. in the menu. clipped sound
02:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hmm maybe it's textrendering? iirc it's expensive
02:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> don't think you can turn that off (maybe by deleting the .ttf in fonts)
02:02 < Fungus> oh boy, changed the resolution and it effed everything up
02:02 < Fungus> forgot randr is a nono
02:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> are you not able to restart with the desired resolution?
02:04 < Fungus> nope, I erased settings
02:05 < Fungus> will use the default once, no vsync and so on
02:10 < Fungus> everything works
02:10 < Fungus> :D
02:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> :D
02:10 < Fungus> apart from the sound
02:10 < Fungus> and limiting the fps to 30
03:38 < Fungus> would teeworlds support kms?
03:38 < Fungus> I imagine that should be faster no?
19:39 < shangul> Hello. I have a question which I have not found its anwer in docs nor via quick search in the forum: How can I launch my server(0.7.5) with a few bots?
19:40 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> test
19:41 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> ok I am shangul and I am happy this channel is bridged to freenode so that I don't have to connect to another network...
19:52 <@Dune> o/
19:52 <@Dune> 0.7.5 Teeworlds does not have a default bot implementation
19:52 <@Dune> so you'll have to use a modification
19:57 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> Dune, Any client bot? e.g. a client which I run it, connects to my server and plays(the AI controls it)
19:57 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> And what mod for 0.7.5 does exist?
19:57 <@Dune> I'm not too aware on client bots, @fokkonaut might know better
19:58 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> So I'll wait for their reply
19:59 <@Dune> cc ChillerDragon
20:03 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> I just noticed "rand()" is a "person"...
20:03 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> XD
20:07 <@Dune> ha, he made server bots 
20:11 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> You sure? Here he has said "his bots are client mod": https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=113802#p113802
20:12 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> I cannot find a link to his client mod...
20:21 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> Another thing: any way to deploy stats or highscores to web?
20:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> my bots are serverside
20:23 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> fokkonaut: 0.7.x server mods with bots?
20:25 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> For DM of course not race
21:09 < rand> mangul: client bot sources were never released
21:10 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> rand, closed source?
21:10 < rand> it was a client that connects on my servers, but for master's rules and long term, I moved it to a server mod
21:10 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> aha
21:11 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> As I said in my comment in the related Github issue, I like the idea of client bots more.
21:12 < rand> the algorithm is roughly the same tho
21:12 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> I just played a short game with my friend and he said it has lag sometimes even through ping was always 106-107. How can I find out what the problem is?
21:13 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> rand, Does a 0.7.x server mod with bots with the same algorithm exist now and is its source code available?
21:14 < rand> yes, it should be somewhere on the forum, or directly on github, default branch of my fork
21:14 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> You are nheir on Github, right?
21:14 < rand> yup
21:15 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> Is master branch stable? Because latest version in releases page is not 0.7.x
21:16 < rand> >  This branch is 123 commits ahead, 420 commits behind teeworlds:master. 
21:16 < rand> this is 0.7
21:16 < rand> but 420 commit behind ^^'
21:17 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> so I fork it
21:17 < rand> merge may have conflicts
21:17 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> err
21:17 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> I meant I clone it
21:18 < rand> and my master is not up to date
21:18 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> Even through I code I am not really meant to be a developer. Even through I study CS ^^
21:18 < rand> prefer using teeworlds/teeworlds as remote
21:18 < rand> (for master)
21:19 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> rand, You mean I use the standard server or what? About git I only know clone/push/add/rm/commit !!!
21:20 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> Or maybe you mean I merge teeworlds/teeworlds with your mod?
21:21 < rand> I would use : git remote add teeworlds https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
21:22 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> Then?
21:22 < rand> then git config branch.master.remote=teeworlds
21:22 < rand> git checkout master; git pull
21:23 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> And  what about conflicts if they appear?
21:23 < rand> this __should__ sync your local repo master with teeworlds upstream
21:23 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> Yeah it is a should and not must
21:24 < rand> then go back to the mod branch: git checkout server_bot0.7
21:24 < rand> git merge master
21:24 < rand> and have fun
21:24 < rand> you can always : git merge --abort 
21:24 < rand> (if things get crazy)
21:25 < rand> the current branch should be ok with 0.7.5 tho
21:25 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> If it didn't work, may I ask for client bot code then?
21:25 < rand> no, this won't help
21:26 < rand> the bot was not 0.7
21:26 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> oh
21:26 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> 80% 200KB/s
21:27 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> (cloning)
21:27 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> rand, Thank you for your help even if it didn't work :)
21:49 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> rand, working fine till now. bots are too smart XD
22:02 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> Because I think my question is lost in this discussion I copy and repost it: < mangul> I just played a short game with my friend and he said it has lag sometimes even through ping was always 106-107. How can I find out what the problem is?
22:12 < rand> there are not too smart, there are omniscient idiots x) 
22:13 < rand> I don't have idea for your lag ~100ms ping
22:14 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> Should there be lag with 100msg ping or not?
22:15 < bridge> [freenode] <mangul> rand, I cannot resist against one of them anyway. perhaps I am too noob?!
23:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> 100ms is kinda bad im
23:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> depends how sensitive you are
