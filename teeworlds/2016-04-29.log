09:51 < CrystalGamma> hi, I'm trying to run the client on a Core 2 Duo laptop on linux, but it cannot get an OGL context … does the game need OGL >2.1 perhaps?
11:39 <@minus> afaik it needs opengl 1 only
12:09 < CrystalGamma> huh. the exact error message is "[gfx]: unable to set video mode: X11 driver not configured with OpenGL" … I tried running it as just “teeworlds” and as “teeworlds "gfx_fullscreen 0"”
12:10 < Henningstone> CrystalGamma: do you have any graphics drivers installed? That'd be a good thing to play a game ^^
12:13 < CrystalGamma> glxinfo says I have GLX 1.4 with OGL 2.1 (mesa/intel)
12:14 <@minus> ttheoretically fine
12:15 < CrystalGamma> any other ideas?
18:58 < Henningstone> Ã¸Ä±Å‹Ä¸
19:15 <@heinrich5991> you do realize it's english? :P
19:17 < rand> oink oink
19:44 <@minus> heinrich5991: cow sounds are not english!
19:44 <@minus> especially not if they contain russian letters
19:46 < rand> it's a russian cow trying to speak english
19:47 <@heinrich5991> s/cow/pig
19:47 < rand> right!
19:47 <@minus> no!
