13:39 <@Dune_> hai
13:40 <@Dune_> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=122523#p122523
13:40 <@Dune_> that's some unusual spam
14:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Interesting to classify erektionsstÃ¶rungen as fan art.
14:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> At least he didn't post a video or artwork for it.
14:27 < Oy> hey
14:27 <@Dune_> hi
14:27 <@Dune_> protocol changed? Oo
14:27 < Oy> yeah
14:27 <@Dune_> isn't that... really early for a protocol change?
14:28 < Oy> nah
14:28 < Oy> just additional server msg's
14:28 <@Dune_> ah, that's backwards compatible?
14:29 < Oy> yeah
14:29 <@Dune_> phew
14:29 < Oy> :P
14:30 <@Dune_> would be nice to get the new scoreboard in next version, I should work on a patch :) almost finished fixing Teecomp's
14:31 < Oy> you mean additional stats?
14:31 <@Dune_> yes
14:31 < Oy> yeah
14:31 < Oy> gathering the stats should be done server-sided
14:32 <@Dune_> http://puu.sh/Cw1Sg/9383ab4fe8.png
14:32 <@Dune_> ah, right
14:32 < Oy> so you have correct one when you enter a game later
14:32 <@Dune_> yeah
14:32 <@Dune_> that one has more stuff https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/490500/48915291-702baa80-ee7e-11e8-8813-ecf67c794db5.png
14:32 <@Dune_> not sure what should get in
14:33 < Oy> hm, yeah not sure either
14:34 <@Dune_> it could count flag defenses I guess?
14:34 < Oy> you mean returns?
14:34 <@Dune_> or flagger kills
14:34 <@Dune_> or both
14:34 <@Dune_> damage stats are impossible to get client-side
14:35 <@Dune_> at least now with the Damageind changes they can be done for ourselves
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> So many figures! ðŸ˜®
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> there's a thread in the private dev talk forum about stats
14:40 < Oy> yeah, with lots of stats it's hard to find the info your looking for pretty quick
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> "Stats to track" is its name
14:40 <@Dune_> that should be public discussion
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Wouldn't put equal information twice.
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> I can figure out the ratio and net on my own
14:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> i can't
14:41 <@Dune_> eh, I like to see the ratio. My maths sometimes bug out =D
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> But with that limited space, it looks very confusing and is hard to read.
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> watch the screenshot after the game
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> If you would have better columns with hide/show functionality and scrollbars, it would fit better.
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> look at*
14:43 <@Dune_> I play with that statboard, and it's not that hard to get the info you're looking for :|
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> But the latter screenshot is very overwhelming.
14:43 <@Dune_> yeah I prefer mine (well obviously :D)
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> But on the other hand, stats like kills per weapon are pretty interesting.
14:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Imo that would fit more to a after-the-game-summary...
14:46 <@Dune_> https://puu.sh/Cw29Z/9bc6fa289e.jpg
14:46 <@Dune_> I had written this but as an offline stat thing
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> that could go in a "player profile" tab in the future
14:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> with achievements etc
14:47 <@Dune_> could make an issue with that
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> But that would be overall, not on per game basis.
14:48 <@Dune_> yes
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah
15:13 < Learath2> After 6 years my PR got merged \o/
15:29 < Oy> \o/
15:39 <@Dune_> gz :D
19:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> \o/
20:22 < jaro> was get hir so ap?
20:23 <@Dune_> wrong chan?
