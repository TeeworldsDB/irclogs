14:07 < heinrich5991> do you happen to remember what tileset_borderfix does or what it should do? https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=115219#p115219
16:42 <@matricks> heinrich5991: me?
16:42 < heinrich5991> oh yes, I wanted to highlight you
16:42 <@matricks> yes, it adds 1 (or 2?) pixels around each tile
16:43 <@matricks> this is to help with issues with hw texture sampling
16:43 < heinrich5991> is there a place where I can find out whether it's one or two pixels (I mean what the hardware needs)?
16:44 <@matricks> check the source, I don't remember if I added 1 or 2
16:44 <@matricks> that whole thing should be tossed however
16:44 < heinrich5991> the source adds 1 pixel
16:44 <@matricks> there you go
16:46 < heinrich5991> ok, thanks.
16:46 <@matricks> but as I said, it should be tossed
16:46 < heinrich5991> yea, I think the fix is implemented for 0.7
16:47 <@matricks> I did one, but the tilesets has to be redone
16:47 <@matricks> pre borderfix
16:47 < heinrich5991> or they could be un-borderfixed
16:47 <@matricks> no
16:48 <@matricks> the thing is that tilesetborderfix basiclly ruins the texture
16:48 <@matricks> and reversing it doubles it so
16:48 < heinrich5991> tileset_borderfix just dropped some rows and columns
16:48 < heinrich5991> maybe dilate does some bad stuff, I don't know that tool
16:48 <@matricks> doesn't it resample?
16:48 <@matricks> might have changed to increase the quality, dunno
16:49 < heinrich5991> no. it just drops the 17th and 49th column
16:49 <@matricks> is that tool dropped from the master branche
16:50 < heinrich5991> yes
16:50 < heinrich5991> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/0.6/src/tools/tileset_borderfix.cpp
16:50 <@matricks> oh, there is several tileset_border* tools
16:50 < heinrich5991> yes, the others are incorrect though (and by me)
16:50 < heinrich5991> (they assume a 2px border instead of a 1px)
16:52 <@matricks> tileset_borderfix does a shitty resample :/
16:53 <@matricks> nearest-resample
16:53 <@matricks> don't look at it...
16:53 <@minus> :D
16:54 < heinrich5991> it's dropping two rows and columns if I looked at it hard enough
16:55 < heinrich5991> which might be "nearest-resample"
16:55 <@matricks> it squeezes 32x32 into 30x30
16:55 <@matricks> and then sets the borders to the nearest color
16:56 < heinrich5991> yes (64x64 -> 62x62 though)
16:56 <@matricks> oh well :)
