00:07 < vali> so impressive...
00:10 <@minus> it's math in it's natural habitat
19:45 < tyurderi> hi, whats up with the master servers? can only find 6 servers currently :/
19:49 < Obani> true
19:49 < Obani> only servers to me are 3 ddnet servers
19:50 < Obani> on official master server list
19:50 < Obani> might be ddos ?
19:50 <@minus> tyurderi: someone's being an ass and attacking the master servers
19:51 < tyurderi> oh damn
19:57 < Obani> shit happends
19:57 <@matricks> duckbutt
19:57 <@matricks> ..
22:08 < Obani> matricks, remembering the short videos you shared here showing some unrealeased features you did for teeworlds ?
22:08 < Obani> like fancy particles affected by bullets
22:09 <@matricks> yah?
22:09 <@minus> anyone done something with teeworlds networking in rust already? heinrich5991?
22:09 < Obani> matricks, is it/will it be/could it be released in some random fork ?
22:10 <@matricks> some of the vector field stuff is in I think but not enabled, it needs work to be really usable
22:10 <@matricks> Obani: all of that was just early code, needed more work
22:11 < Obani> matricks, anyway it could be published in case someone wants to use it
22:11 <@matricks> as I said, it's in the code already I think
22:11 < Obani> I'm thinking to GoreWorld client that had fancy and not overdoing graphical effects
22:11 < Obani> oh
22:12 <@matricks> or not
22:13 <@matricks> cleaned out
22:13 < Obani> Anyway if it still exist, if it was published and shared on the forum I think it could be interesting for this kind of people
22:14 <@matricks> dunno where the code is, probably better to just rewrite it
23:25 <@heinrich5991> minus: yes
