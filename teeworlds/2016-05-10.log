01:19 < needs> I'm actually working on this kind of stuff for teerank.  Without using demos.  The idea is to poll servers more and more often as the match is about to end.  Up to a poll every seconds.  When score reset to zero, it means the match ended and therefor we can pick a winner, if any.
01:20 < needs> It's also planned to add a JSON API to be able to retrieve that kind of data.  Not yet written tho
01:21 < needs> It will only work for 1v1, so almost dm1 only
01:22 < needs> It's really a shame teams are not sent with server infos, I think I only need that to be able to rank any game of teeworlds vanilla :)
