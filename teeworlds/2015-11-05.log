02:49 < NiKiS> hi all, if there are any admins here, look at this topic and tell me what you think :) https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=116358
07:44 < guenstig_werben> @minus @matricks one on?
08:25 <@matricks> I'm
09:08 <@matricks> omg
09:17 <@matricks> nice, guy wanna complain about people not playing nicely, joins the channel and straight off the bat breaks two rules
09:21 <@matricks> btw
09:21 <@matricks> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11639
09:22 <@matricks> thoughts people?
09:29 < masoudd> It's disgusting
09:29 <@matricks> yap, but what should you do about it? :)
09:30 < masoudd> If you ban the ip they will easily change it and continue
09:30 <@matricks> banning them kinda opens flood gates as well
09:31 < masoudd> But why would they want more people in their servers so much? To the extent that they will ddos other servers?
09:31 <@matricks> kids
09:31 < masoudd> Yeah figured
09:31 <@matricks> gives them control over players
09:31 <@matricks> they want power ;)
09:31 < masoudd> I'm scared just thinking about what would they do when they grow up
09:32 <@matricks> well, behave perhaps
09:32 < masoudd> such thirst for power can not end well
09:32 <@matricks> well, people do grow up as well so
09:33 < masoudd> I hope
09:34 <@matricks> I mean, if admins start banning servers because people say that they behave bad.. thats going on annecdotal evidence, the worst kind of evidence, and start stretching the rules for what they ban for etc
09:34 < masoudd> Yes. Good point.
09:34 <@matricks> the general rule have always been that they don't get involved in player conflicts because.. well
09:35 <@matricks> it's a mess without having any good evidence to go on
09:36 < masoudd> That's the price of being open. It's the same as aim bots. Having an open structure makes these abuses possible
09:37 <@matricks> yup
09:37 < masoudd> It still bothers me that there's nothing to be done about it.
09:37 <@matricks> it's really really hard :/
09:38 <@matricks> I've thought about the aimbot problem for years with no good solution to it
09:38 < masoudd> If not impossible
09:38 <@matricks> I only have one
09:38 < masoudd> Please share that one solution
09:38 <@matricks> make it the game
09:38 <@matricks> never seen a bot to make aimbots
09:38 < masoudd> Ah so to embrace it?
09:39 <@matricks> yeah, there are games like that
09:39 <@matricks> and I've never seen anyone write a bot that.. well.. can write bots :)
09:39 < masoudd> There is a relevant xkcd here
09:40 < masoudd> https://xkcd.com/810/
09:40 <@matricks> hehe
09:41 < masoudd> I think these kind of games have a lot of potential
09:41 <@matricks> masoudd: well, my solution was design the game so it was really hard to actually make a bot for it, but computers are a bit too powerful today
09:41 < masoudd> But sadly the audience is only programmers
09:41 <@matricks> yap
09:42 < masoudd> Have you seen the soccer2d competitions?
09:43 < masoudd> You have to write programs that play soccer. and compete with other people's programs
09:43 <@matricks> nope, and now I have meetings for the rest of the day
09:44 < masoudd> Doesn't matter how you write the client. As long as the client has to send mouse movement to the server and receive enemy positions from the server, aim bots are easy to write
09:44 <@matricks> yeah, but make the aiming part hard! :D
09:44 <@matricks> not simple prediction
09:45 < masoudd> That's the thing. People can undo any modification you do to the client.
09:46 <@matricks> but I'm not talking about source here, I'm talking that you have to predict the other player better
09:46 <@matricks> so you are putting the computer up to another brain which have loads of computational power :)
09:46 <@matricks> but it's hard as I said
09:47 <@matricks> but now, I need to goto meetings
09:47 < masoudd> OK nice chat
15:32 < qwery> d
16:18 < Obani> yo
16:19 < Fels> oink
16:20 <@matricks> BONK!
16:21 <@matricks> pig
16:22 < Fels> i am depressed. 
16:22 < Fels> http://steamcharts.com/app/380840#All
16:23 <@matricks> heh
16:23 <@matricks> Fels: maybe start DDOSing other games to get some players to teeworlds
16:23 < Devotee> good idea
16:24 < Obani> Fels, steam is bad source
16:24 < Obani> I don't play on steam anymore
16:24 < Obani> It's too long to launch
16:24 < Obani> Also you can't have clients on Steam
16:25 < Fels> matricks pls fix
16:25 <@matricks> Fels: fix what?
16:25 < Fels> what Obani said :(
16:26 <@matricks> sounds like a steam problem
16:26 < Obani> What do you mean ?
16:27 < Fels> Teeworlds is open source.. Steam only refers a game to 1 source. that means if you want to use a client you basicly play "another" game and steam cant handle this. 
16:27 < Obani> I discovered that client https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11630
16:28 <@heinrich5991> "too long to launch" - steam's problem
16:28 <@heinrich5991> "different client" - just replace the client executable (almost like installing a mod previosuly)
16:28 < Obani> heinrich5991, that would erase time playing and would not appear in Steam graphs
16:29 < Obani> played
16:29 < Obani> Or maybe should I change a file ?
16:29 <@heinrich5991> "
16:29 <@heinrich5991> "replace the client executable"
16:29 < Obani> BUt anyway when I want to play this fast game fast I want it launches fast :p
16:30 <@matricks> Obani: then stop using inferior products
16:30 <@matricks> like steam
16:30 < Obani> matricks, that's what I did
16:30 <@matricks> vanilla should launch quickly
16:31 < Obani> well when the game is launched, the loading isn't long. But steam really is annoying :/
16:31 < Fels> mhmm i love vanilla ice cream
16:31 < Obani> prefer stracciatella
16:32 <@matricks> then stop using if it's annoying
16:34 < Fels> can we do it so we are forced to open tw with a command-prompt-window ?
16:39 <@heinrich5991> what do you mean?
16:40 < Fels> well, we just talked about annoyance. instead of klicking the .exe we have to write a command line to start tw :>
16:41 < masoudd> Since when?
16:42 < Fels> ... nothing. that was a joke. 
16:42 < masoudd> Ah
16:42 < Fels> :C
16:42 < masoudd> I got worried there
23:55 < Mr-Anderson> wtf happens with the irc? o.O
23:56 < Fels> what do you mean?
23:57 < Mr-Anderson> i could not connect to it.. after a few minutes i was automatically joined an empty #teeworlds channel on quakenet o.O
23:57 < Fels> netsplit.
23:58 < Fels> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit
23:58 < Mr-Anderson> oh, ok. thx :)
