14:48 < Bishal> hi i am new here

14:49 < Bishal> yes thank you
14:49 < Bishal> thank you 
14:50 < Bishal> very much
14:53 < Bishal> dune if you ever see this- i am asking you for the bridge between IRC and discord. Can i pls have it. asked politely. 
14:53 < Bishal> tthx
17:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you need to specify your discord nick (best if you ask on the discord server directly)
17:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> configure.lua:109: there is no configuration option named 'buildwithoutsseflag'
17:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> any1 saw this error already?
17:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
17:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i did git checkout 0.6 and tried to build with latest bam
17:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh wait configure is untracked right? my fault sorri that was stupid af xd
17:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh no it was config.lua that is untracked hmm
17:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nvm rechchking out and bam -c all did the job sorry for this usless question
17:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah it's a bit annoying when switching between versions. Not sure how to fix it, I think it's a flaw in bam iirc
17:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> not only in bam also git struggle with submodules
17:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i dont think there is a need to fix it until git fixed it :p
