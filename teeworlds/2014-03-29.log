12:02 < BotoX> check the forums
12:06 < JulianAssange> link
12:06 < JulianAssange> the point is it's april fools in a few days
12:07 < JulianAssange> http://i.imgur.com/QMRTZbI.png heh

12:08 <@minus> holy shit that was 2012 already
12:09 < BotoX> ya
12:32 < JulianAssange> http://i.imgur.com/mRU13Ng.png
12:32 < JulianAssange> hmmm
12:35 < Learath2> stuck without youtube :P
12:36 < BotoX> who, you?
12:36 < BotoX> http://www.opennicproject.org/nearest-servers/
12:36 < BotoX> http://www.opennicproject.org/configure-your-dns/
12:36 < BotoX> step it up Learath2 
12:37 < Learath2> i think they blocked port 53 or smth 
12:37 < BotoX> need a VPN?
12:37 < Learath2> need to try one last thing :D
12:37 < BotoX> try it with the opennic server
12:37 < BotoX> s
12:38 < Learath2> nah port 53 isnt blocked
12:38 < Learath2> so its just the popular dns servers
12:38 < JulianAssange> of course it isn't blocked lol
12:38 < BotoX> ya
12:38 < JulianAssange> you wouldn't be in this irc if poirt 53 was blocked
12:38 < JulianAssange> but uh
12:38 < BotoX> huh
12:38 < Learath2> JulianAssange: wat
12:38 < BotoX> they can block outgoing only
12:38 < JulianAssange> nano /etc/hosts
12:38 < BotoX> JulianAssange, allow 53 inside of their network
12:38 < Learath2> they already do it with 25
12:39 < BotoX> and filter all going upstream
12:39 < BotoX> so you can only use their DNS servers
12:39 < BotoX> at least on the standard port
12:39 < JulianAssange> just
12:39 < JulianAssange> nano /etc/hosts 
12:39 < JulianAssange> 58.162.62.20 youtube.com
12:39 < BotoX> leeeeeeeeeel
12:39 < JulianAssange> lol
12:40 < BotoX> implying he's on linux
12:40 < JulianAssange> ok
12:40 < JulianAssange> notepad.exe C:/Windows/Hosts
12:40 < JulianAssange> ?
12:40 < Learath2> i should really go to linux to eliminate windows interfering with me 
12:42 < BotoX> time to play goatsimulator
12:45 < Learath2> thanks BotoX
12:45 < BotoX> np
12:45 < Learath2> opennic servers arent blocked
12:46 < Learath2> should really take my time to setup a VPN server
12:48 < JulianAssange> >goatsimulator
12:48 < JulianAssange> plz tell me that's real BotoX 
12:49 <@minus> C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\Etc\hosts actually
12:49 < Learath2> goatsimulator is out ???
12:49 < Learath2> my god should buy
12:49 < JulianAssange> minus: there are 2
12:49 < BotoX> yeah
12:50 < JulianAssange> actually i think there are 3
12:50 < JulianAssange> 2 files
12:50 < JulianAssange> 1 non-file
12:50  * minus shrugs
12:50 < BotoX> >buy
12:50 <@minus> /etc/hosts it is
12:50 < BotoX> I'll pm ya 
12:50 < JulianAssange> mhm
12:50 < JulianAssange> so lots of viruses put their stuff in all 3
12:50 < JulianAssange> so it's harder to manually remove
12:50 <@minus> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1209 not sure if should comment
12:50 < JulianAssange> do it
12:51 < JulianAssange> i dont want it BotoX  lol
12:51 < JulianAssange> "goat simulator"
12:51 < JulianAssange> you must be kidding lol
12:51 <@minus> heinrich5991: i'm too lazy to do that server list for that map thing
12:53 < JulianAssange> has anyone ever thought of actually making a GOOD linux virus?
12:53 < JulianAssange> i don't imagine it would be too hard..
13:01 <@minus> heinrich5991: actually, if you just want a list: https://git.mnus.de/cgit/teeworlds_srvbrowse/commit/?id=75647c7c6efe9616b33a30228b5d2990008c6679
13:01 < heinrich5991> minus: ok, I'll implement it myself :P
13:18 < heinrich5991> minus: Y U NO github?
13:19 <@minus> heinrich5991: Just Cause
13:19 < heinrich5991> meh
13:19 <@minus> heinrich5991: want me to push it to github?
13:19 < heinrich5991> well, unless you have a reason not to put it there, I think it's not really beneficial on your server? :/
13:20 <@minus> oh right it's not publically cloneable on my server
13:20 <@minus> i forgot
13:20  * minus has SSH access
13:23 <@minus> heinrich5991: https://github.com/minus7/teeworlds_srvbrowse
13:24 < Learath2> i was thinking about having a productive day BotoX
13:25 < BotoX> I'm trying to run goat simulator on wine
13:25 < BotoX> might just reboot and play it on windows
13:25 < Learath2> now ill prolly play goat sim all day :D
13:25 < heinrich5991> wtf is goat simulator?
13:25 < BotoX> >not knowing about the greatest game ever
13:25 < BotoX> http://jenkins.soupwhale.com/GoatSimulator.zip
13:37 < Learath2> this game is just plain amazing
14:32 < JulianAssange> Learath2: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7492000
15:38 < Learath2> JulianAssange: well not all dns traffic apparently
15:39 <@minus> seems they're just rerouting public DNS servers
15:39 <@minus> Learath2: what happens when you go to youtube.com?
15:39 < Learath2> it works with the opennic dns
15:40 <@minus> without that
15:40 <@minus> because it does seem to resolve to an ip address, but i get no reply from that one
15:42 < Learath2> it resolves to 195.175.254.2
15:42 <@minus> yeah, can you surf that?
15:43 < Learath2> nopr
15:44 <@minus> k
15:44 <@minus> i guess it's /probably/ being DDoSed
15:44 <@minus> 99% sure on that
15:46 < Learath2> not sure if they have a web server on it
15:46 < Learath2> they route some other sites to that ip too it never responded before
15:51 < Learath2> kinda weird that i cant access opennicproject.com anymore :D
15:52 < Learath2> .org*
15:55 < Learath2> well the actual site went down apparently 
15:58 <@minus> yeah
15:58 < Learath2> no idea what their filtering criteria is 
15:59 < Learath2> prolly they are dumb enough to use a list of common dns servers 
16:02 <@minus> most certainly
18:37 < Maimer_> anyone know someone by the name of ravomavain?
18:37 <@minus> yay, py3 support https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paramiko/1.13.0
18:38 < ravomavain> Yeah, me...
18:38 <@minus> lol :D
18:38 < Maimer_> and you own ravomavain.eu?
18:39 < ravomavain> Yeah
18:39 < Maimer_> do you have another client logged on to quakenet using the name Maimer
18:39 < ravomavain> Don't think so
18:39 < Maimer_> I am trying to figure out this mystery
18:40 < BotoX> * [Maimer] (~frzaknkwc@hosted-by.ravomavain.eu): frzaknkwc
18:40 < BotoX> lel
18:40 <@minus> inb4 haxd
18:40 < Maimer_> yea thats what I found
18:40 < Maimer_> I am just confused, this "Maimer" has been online for 24 hours a day, but in no visible channels
18:40 < BotoX> bouncer
18:40 < ravomavain> I'm not the only one on the server, will ask other ppl
18:41 < Maimer_> its just confusing to me
18:41 <@minus> http://python3wos.appspot.com/ ‚Üê the only thing i really miss for python3 is Twisted
18:41 < Maimer_> because after I started searching the internet, it brought me right back here
18:41 < BotoX> >boto
18:41 < BotoX> missing an X there
18:41 <@minus> ;)
18:41 < BotoX> http://i.4cdn.org/b/src/1396112453545.jpg
18:42 <@minus> oh, requests is py3 compatible too
18:46 <@minus> http://freepythontips.wordpress.com/2014/02/08/if-you-could-change-something-in-python-what-would-it-be/ i like point number 3 :)
19:02 < JulianAssange> ROFL BotoX 
19:02 < JulianAssange> damn
19:02 < BotoX> LMAO JulianAssange 
19:03 < JulianAssange> that shit's funny
19:03 < BotoX> ya
19:10 <@minus> https://www.dropbox.com/s/83ppa5iykqmr14z/Py2v3Hackers2013.pptx 
19:10 < BotoX> >pptx
19:11 <@minus> dropbox converts to pdf
19:11 < BotoX> erm nope
19:11 <@minus> though libreoffice handles it better
19:11 <@minus> ok, here's a different one, as pdf https://www.dropbox.com/s/essjj4qmmtrhys4/SFMeetup2013.pdf
19:12 <@minus> about python 3.4's asyncio module
19:12 <@minus> which uses coroutines
20:37 < JulianAssange> Learath2: http://t.co/SwSjejdv2L
20:38 < JulianAssange> im surprised some russian h4x0r hasn't hacked the 81.212.0.0/16 range lol
20:48 < JulianAssange> Learath2: http://85.111.6.83/ translate?
21:14 < Learath2> JulianAssange: site you are trying to access has been taken down by a court order
21:59 < JulianAssange> ty
22:49 <@minus> heinrich5991: did you fork?
