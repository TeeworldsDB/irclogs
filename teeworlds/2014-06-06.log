17:00 < Madara_> Where is it specified that Teeworlds automatically uses 'default' if it can't find the (custom)-skiin?
17:00 < Madara_> Hello! :D
17:01 <@minus> $ grep -R default src
17:01 < Madara_> Tried that.
17:01 < Madara_> :D
17:01 < Madara_> Implies that I am running Linux/Mac.
17:01 < Madara_> Luckily I run :D
17:02 <@minus> always implying
17:02 < Madara_> looks better than my way.
17:02 < Madara_> I should learn to handle my console just better.
17:06 < Madara_> is there a way to use quotes on that grep-search?
17:06 < Madara_> Like in HTML with &quote; :D
17:07 < heinrich5991> search for quotes?
17:07 < heinrich5991> grep -r '"quotes"'
17:07 < Madara_> Ok thx.
17:07 < heinrich5991> looks for "quotes"
17:08 <@minus> mh, pycharm 3.4
17:09 <@minus> did a quick argument typechecking implementation with a decorator and annotations
17:10 <@minus> it's like 10 lines
17:12 < heinrich5991> instead of duct-taping types to python
17:12 < heinrich5991> what about using a language with types? ^^
17:12 <@minus> but python is so convenient
17:12 <@minus> i don't actually use it for type/checking/
17:13 <@minus> i use it to convert arguments to the right type
17:13 <@minus> it's a string? hit the database and give me the ID
17:15 <@minus> also, i already have a bunch implemented here
17:34 <@minus> 2999 commits in the git repo
17:37 < Madara_> Fact: It's funny to play with RenderTileMap commented out.
17:37 < heinrich5991> minus: of a private project?
17:37 <@minus> teeworlds
17:51 <@minus> heinrich5991: 2999 commits in the teeworlds repo. nothing to do with the stuff i talked about earlier
17:52 < heinrich5991> yea ok
18:38 < Madara_> Sorry
18:39 < Madara_> How to make ticks in teeworlds?
18:57 < Madara_> And is there a function implented in teeworlds to convert RGB into Hex.
18:57 < Madara_> Would be nice to know before I create one.
19:25 < heinrich5991> Madara_: what do you mean by 'RGB' to hex?
19:26 < Madara_> If you have a value in floats, like: r = 0.5f, b = 1.0f, [blah] and the function will return a int like #0fff00..
19:26 < Madara_> Not sure if 0fff00 is right, but ya know
19:26 < Madara_> 0x0fff00
19:29 < heinrich5991> Madara_: the function will be as simple as (((int)(r * 256))<<16) | (((int)(g * 256))<<8) | (int)(b * 256)
19:29 < Madara_> I know, but I wanted to know if there is already a function :D
19:30 < heinrich5991> I don't know
19:37 <@minus> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI4dOUQ1xaU such a nice visualization

19:43 < Madara_> But the music itself is a matter of taste... (Risking a ban from this server)
19:43 < Madara_> t*of
19:44 < heinrich5991> mh.. meh visualisation
19:45 < Madara_> I think music AND visualisation are a matter of taste xD
19:45 <@minus> it's simple
19:45 < Madara_> KISS
19:45 < Madara_> xD
19:47 < heinrich5991> minus: there are vis that are more simple :)
19:49 <@minus> simple enough but not too simple!
19:50 <@minus> have some music http://titan.mnus.de/scene/The_Sound_of_SceneSat_Volume_3_FLAC.zip (~3GiB)
