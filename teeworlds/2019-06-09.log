12:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> any one knows how to build 64bit with bam on windows?
12:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nvm got it the setting is called arch=
12:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> x86_64 ?
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Who is using bam over cmake anyway.
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> :)
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon it should default to 64bit though, don you have an old bam?
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Btw Dune, whaht would be the steps to migrate mods from bam to cmake?
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> I am not familiar with cmake (shame).
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> @ChillerDragon was complaining that cmake would fail.
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I am not familiar either. Just copy the cmakefiles and fix it
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> He got plenty of linker errors...
16:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> I guess I should add some stuff to CMakeList, but I don't know.
16:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> then you can use bam
16:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> But would be nice to support cmake too
16:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> bam worked
16:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Would I need to add all additional mod files to CMakeList?
16:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Or should it work ootb?
16:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you have to list all the files in the cmakelists
16:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> in alphabetical order too
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's why I don't support it on my tw projects, too annoying to maintain
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Ok. Then my "gamemodes/dom.cpp" and "gamemodes/dom.h" would go right under ""gamemodes/dm.h"
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah
16:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Hmm. I wonder if there would be a way to automate that.
16:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there is
16:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> For sure. ðŸ˜ƒ
16:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> Anyway, I think/hope I should get it working now. Thank you!
16:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol, why alphabetical order, should work either way.
19:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> At least do it for better readability.
