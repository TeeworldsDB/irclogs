22:07 < nameless_tee91> Hi. I am wondering how i can get the winner of each round into a log file.
22:46 <@heinrich5991> nameless_tee91: I'm not even sure whether the server calculates the winner
22:46 <@heinrich5991> are you trying to modify the source to do that or do you only want to parse the logs (don't think it's possible with only the latter)
22:59 < nameless_tee91> Ok. That would make sense. If the server doesn't calculate it. No i am not trying to modify anything. Am just wondering. How to create a dm tournament in an 1 hour event on multiple maps. The task is to automate finding a winner.
23:09 <@heinrich5991> mh
23:09 <@heinrich5991> too tired :(
23:09 <@heinrich5991> you could record demos and figure out the winner manually
23:10 <@heinrich5991> not sure if there is some automatic demo parsing
23:15 < nameless_tee91> Thanks for your help. Will have a look at it tomorrow again.
