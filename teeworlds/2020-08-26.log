18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I know @Learath2
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But deen sent a link from it, so I thought he isnt aware of it
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Ah I see
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But I also just noticed his message is 3 days ago, weird, discord just showed it as unread messages
