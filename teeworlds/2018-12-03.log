00:11 < ChillerDragon> Oy still here? I am done! Its working on my moms imac without any libs installed
00:11 < ChillerDragon> finally fully working
00:12 < ChillerDragon> I did some changes. Some dirty hacky ones and some nice ones. But i guess we have to wait for heinrich before i can commit them
00:17 < ChillerDragon> http://149.202.127.134/tmp/teeworlds-0.7.1-osx.dmg
10:41 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/fpKhz
10:41 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 6febd33 oy: fixed data dir detection on macos
10:41 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master f89d533 oy: fixed make_release script on macos (brew installation for sdl/freetype)
10:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oy uff thats a big commit
10:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but you know that i fixed everything already yesterday? xd
10:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon he is not on irc
10:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> meh
10:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> besides I assume we need a reliable, clean fix for the release anyway
10:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how do i contact him then i spend all night building and fixing the macos stuff
10:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> github
10:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i guess this is the old style with the make release script
10:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i hope my fixes for cmake are still usefull -.-
11:58 < Dune> minus: ping
11:59 < Dune> downloads.teeworlds.com ought to be updated :)
12:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Does anyone know what that error box means http://puu.sh/CbFcQ/3b55da42e6.png ?
12:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I compiled tw myself and put the exe into the folder from the rc
12:06 < Dune> well, don't speak german
12:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Executable couldnt start correctly
12:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no information what so ever
12:07 < Dune> just google the error code
12:07 < Dune> http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/answers/id-1991597/windows-bit-error-0xc000007b.html
12:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh an btw Oy your mac release has a bug
12:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
12:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/519107342030340096/Bildschirmfoto_2018-12-03_um_12.06.10.png
12:07 < Dune> 0xc000007b error usually comes from mixing up 32bit environment with 64bit one.
12:07 < Dune> there you go
12:07 < Dune> Oy is not here, you should stop pinging him
12:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Why is he not here
12:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> :c
12:07 < Dune> he usually isn't
12:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> The icon in the rc is not working if the app is outside of the volumn
12:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> my release works fine
12:08 < Dune> well report bugs on github/forums
12:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> k
12:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> should i create a issue for that?
12:08 < Dune> your initiative
12:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh ty Dune the 64 thing makes total sense because if i selfcompile is probably 32 and i downloaed the 64 bit rc
12:17 < minus> Dune: mh?
12:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> dont use oys version miuns it has a bugged icon
12:17 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/releases
12:17 < minus> mh
12:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> http://149.202.127.134/tmp/teeworlds-0.7.1-osx.dmg
12:17 < Dune> can you rehost those on downloads.teeworlds.com?
12:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> use that mac rls
12:18 < minus> i can, later
12:18 < Dune> we'll see that later @ChillerDragon
12:18 < Dune> thanks minus
12:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hm Dune?
12:18 < Dune> I'll keep github links for now
12:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oys version has clearly 1 bug more than my version
12:18 < Dune> yes. add those to the list of bugs of the release candidate
12:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Where is the list? I made a issue for that
12:19 < Dune> a bug that already has a fix is nice
12:19 < Dune> hold on
12:19 < Dune> it is better to have releases that match the source we provide, you know
12:19 < Dune> all the same source.
12:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Then merge heinrichs pr so i can pr all my fixes on top
12:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I understand that matching source makes sense. But a working mac version is nice aswell
12:27 < Dune> yes, that's up to oy

12:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Eng: It is broken and cant be executed.
12:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> nothing was done yet
12:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hmm
12:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> this is the github release
12:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> weird
12:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> because the github release can be executed on my laptop
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's the same link, normally
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> just checked, it is
12:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Yes it is
12:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ok now the github version stopped working aswell for me lul
12:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> And no nice error dialoge this time :c
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I suggest using my version. It is tested on 2 different apple devices and only has some changes in storage.cpp

15:32 < rand> @Dune @ChillerDragon : i used `connect` command several times with succes before. It was on command line though (at launch time)
15:32 < rand> was cl_connect in 0.6 ?
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you mean in the .cfg?
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think cl_connect is a relic
15:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's to connect using the .cfg
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cl_connect is something else that the connect command
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cl_connect is a setting for a cfg
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> *why* would you want to set that in the cfg though
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> fast connect
15:34 < rand> why not ?
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> if u play on the same server with this cfg
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can set the server address
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> and then all you have to do is tap enter once
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> as client loads
15:35 < rand> but does connect work in .cfg ?
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ys
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> cl_connect does, I don't think connect does?
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> u put a autoexec.cfg next to ur client and it starts into th eserver
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> super usefull if u start the client automaitcally
15:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> with a script or something like that
15:36 < rand> so, why do we need cl_connect if connect is enough ?
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also nice for testing and headless clients
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think he misread you, rand
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah
15:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh i didnt test that
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sec
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> besides, if you set the server address you only have to tap once to connect, that seems reasonable, @ChillerDragon
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh ye it does rand xd
15:37 < rand> i used `teeworlds 'connect ...'`
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nvm im pr is useless then
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> we can delete the code then
15:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yy

15:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon please don't do PR just to remove commented out code
15:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> why not and what should i do instead?
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> nothing. if there is no functionality change, don't PR
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> this code is redundant and nto working at all
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there are commented out bits of code a bit everywhere, e.g. the news code, etc.
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and?
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's wiser not to spam the repo everytime you see a couple of lines of code that could be better, if there is no functionality to add
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> commented code can be nice yes. But this piece of code doesnt work if you uncomment it. And it has a working code 10 lines below that does the same
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> spam repo with prs or commits?
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> same
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i dotn get why
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> because it is extremely unimportant and not worth the trouble of a PR
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> why is a pr trouble?
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> alright, do as you like
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes it is not important it is a small cleanup to avoid confusion if someone else comes accross this code
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if you want to clean up the code, do a big PR with changes all across.
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Who has trobule? I dont want to bring anybody in trouble
15:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> no one else does this, there must be a reason
15:50 < rand> you should cherish contributors dune ♥
15:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> alright, I'll shut up then :)
15:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i though everybody else is just too lazy and has beter things to do
15:51 < rand> better do bunch of commits before making a pr though
15:52 < rand> small pr that don't do anything are poor 
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> hmm i like small prs but i try to change that. It is just that normally i rarley stubmle on such things so it would take ages and the branch names wont fitt anymore
15:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> note that code improvements are most welcome :) there are some lists here and there, e.g. https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1120
15:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> just try to make it substantial
15:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i am not a programmer idk how to fix things

18:51 < Oy> hey
18:51 < Dune> will you remove the K/D locales by yourself? :)
18:52 < Oy> unless u want to do it ? ;)
18:52 < Dune> I'm leaving office, so I'd rather not
18:52 < Oy> ok
18:53 < ChillerDragon> Oy sorry for repeating but i finished a osx dmg and yours is not working :c
18:53 < Oy> what's the problem?
18:53 < ChillerDragon> It doesnt start
18:53 < ChillerDragon> no error message
18:54 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1762
18:54 < Dune> more exactly, it doesn't start after the second try, right?
18:54 < ChillerDragon> Yes
18:54 < ChillerDragon> thats super weird
18:54 < ChillerDragon> but the first time the icon was already buggy
18:54 < Oy> unmount old volume
18:54 < Oy> it the same as all previous versions
18:55 < Dune> so the only problem would be the icon
18:56 < ChillerDragon> i did Oy
18:56 < Oy> dunno if people bothered before
18:57 < ChillerDragon> It is not working at all
18:58 < ChillerDragon> I tested it multiple times
18:58 < Dune> you sure you got it unmounted?
18:58 < ChillerDragon> I suggest to merge heinrichs pr so i can pr the fixings
18:58 < ChillerDragon> pretty sure
18:58 < Oy> worked on the mac i tried
18:58 < ChillerDragon> Weird
18:59 < ChillerDragon> sec lemme try on antoher mac
19:00 < Oy> it's the same way as the previous teeworlds versions for mac have been done
19:01 < ChillerDragon> But the previous verions worked on the two devices i tested this one on
19:01 < ChillerDragon> And also on my moms imac it completly fails it doesn't launch and it doesnt even give and message
19:01 < Oy> that's odd
19:02 < ChillerDragon> no fake news sorry
19:02 < Dune> might want to start with the console mode (-c)
19:02 < ChillerDragon> my moms mac is slow sometimes it loaded a message now
19:02 < ChillerDragon> it fails on libpng
19:02 < Oy> oh ok
19:02 < Oy> have to add that
19:02 < Oy> dependency of freetype i guess
19:03 < Dune> start it on your own machine with -c if you can, ChillerDragon 
19:03 < ChillerDragon> how do i pass -c
19:03 < ChillerDragon> so i have to launch the binary from terminal?
19:04 < Dune> yes
19:04 < ChillerDragon> what does -c then do
19:04 < ChillerDragon> it is terminal already if i start it from terminal
19:04 < Dune> open a console, 0.6 style
19:04 < ChillerDragon> hue? lemme test
19:04 < Dune> either way you should get some log that we can use to understand
19:05 < ChillerDragon> yes libpng is missing
19:06 < ChillerDragon> no such command -c and it works fine xd
19:06 < ChillerDragon> but nobody executes teeworlds from commandline especially not mac users
19:06 < Dune> you can change that in the application settings, probably
19:08 < Dune> eh, maybe not. idk mac
19:09 < Oy> ChillerDragon: do u use brew to install the libs?
19:09 < ChillerDragon> yes thats why it is always working on my own laptop
19:09 < ChillerDragon> but it fails on my moms
19:09 < Oy> yeah
19:09 < ChillerDragon> you have to pack everything into the dmg
19:10 < ChillerDragon> and use relative dmg paths
19:10 < ChillerDragon> not the global brew ones
19:10 < Oy> yeah done for freetype and sdl
19:10 < ChillerDragon> i had to do it for libwav aaswell iirc
19:10 < ChillerDragon> ye pretty sure
19:10 < Oy> whatever that is
19:10 < ChillerDragon> ik xd
19:12 < Oy> do u have the dmg i put in release on github?
19:12 < ChillerDragon> yes
19:12 < ChillerDragon> downloaded from tw.com and github but it is the same anyways
19:12 < Oy> could u paste otool -l Teeworlds.app/Contents/MacOS/teeworlds
19:13 < ChillerDragon> https://pastebin.com/raw/5v57Rqn4
19:14 < Oy> thx
19:14 < ChillerDragon> Why do you even bother to do the whole work agian Oy i managed it already
19:15 < Oy> it should work without cmake too
19:21 < Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=122045#p122045
19:21 < Dune> seems like something was changed with respect to 4k
19:22 < ChillerDragon> i wonder how he even launched tw
19:29 < Dune> I'm glad we went ahead with RC
19:29 < ChillerDragon> y
19:31 < Dune> people overall sound enthusiastic and willing to upgrade, that's nice :)
19:31 < Dune> seems like skins and 64p have done much for that
19:32 < ChillerDragon> well I don't know with which people you hang out but i had a very different impression :c
19:32 < Dune> I mean, after the rc
19:32 < ChillerDragon> It got a bit better maybe
19:32 < Dune> people are always reluctant to change, of course, it'll take its time :)
19:34 < ChillerDragon> Well i guess i will just move my work out of the /tmp folder store it somewhere and wait until heinrich comes back
19:35 < ChillerDragon> lay back and chill i will watch some netflix. But feel fre to ping me if you need some mac testing
19:57 < Dune> One could be tempted to open an issue "make oy an avatar" :P
19:58 < ChillerDragon> true
19:59 < ChillerDragon> I never saw him ingame i don't even know what skin he uses
20:02 < Oy> :P
20:09 < Learath2> did you ever get the mac build working?
20:09 < Learath2> ChillerDragon: ^^
20:11 < Learath2> Apparently not, what is the issue, why do you need heinrich for it?
20:13 < rand> because he is wonderful
20:13 < ChillerDragon> Learath2 i did it yes. Everything is working fine c:
20:14 < ChillerDragon> But it is based on heinrichs pr and i don't like making prs on his fork i would like to make the prs on the tw repo
20:15 < Learath2> Just make the pr on teeworlds/teeworlds with your branch?
20:22 < Learath2> ChillerDragon: ^^
20:23 < ChillerDragon> As i said it is based on heinrichs cmake pr
20:24 < Learath2> So? You can create a pr for the entire thing
20:24 < Learath2> heinrich's pr_cmake+your_fixes
20:26 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fp6xJ
20:26 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master bc11da7 oy: fixed make_release script on macos to include libpng
20:27 < Learath2> besides heinrich being here won't change anything, the only thing that could matter is Oy merging pr_cmake, even then git is smart enough to know how much your branch has diverged from master
20:36 < ChillerDragon> im not a git wizard what you suggested sounds like stealing heinrichs pr xd
20:36 < ChillerDragon> so i will probably just wait for Oy to merge the pr
20:38 < Learath2> ChillerDragon: people get credit for commits, commits don't change ownership according to who created the pull request
20:38 < Learath2> it'll always be authored by heinrich
20:39 < Oy> the file list within the pr needs to be updated
20:39 < Oy> the mac on github should work now
20:39 < Oy> *+app
20:40 < Learath2> It works with the wrong file list?
20:41 < ChillerDragon> no oy doesnt compile with cmake
20:41 < ChillerDragon> and heinrichs pr doesnt work yet
20:41 < Learath2> guess it compiles with bam?
20:45 < Learath2> ChillerDragon: can you atleast push yours to your own repo?....
20:45 < Oy> think the file list is an older one
20:46 < Oy> that mac app on github was build with bam
20:47 < Learath2> fwiw what I build myself with bam gets my mac completely stuck except for ctrl+shift+q, black screen
20:48 < Learath2> your copy on github does start up but I get slo-mo sound :P
20:49 < Learath2> and if I start it one time I think it modifies the dmg and so the dmg becomes damaged
20:50 < Oy> which sdl version do u use?
20:52 < Learath2> if you still use sdl1 it's 1.2.15, if you use sdl2 it's 2.0.8
20:52 < Oy> sdl2
20:52 < Oy>  ok
20:53 < ChillerDragon> Learath2 if you want that i can do it tomorrow but i still would prefer a pr
20:54 < ChillerDragon> yo Oy are you planning to merge heinrichs pr in the near future?
20:54 < Learath2> ChillerDragon: you are going to give me a stroke :D
20:56 < rand> ChillerDragon: you have to push your code on your repo in order to make a pr
20:56 < rand> so you can push anyway
20:57 < rand> whatever the repo (teeworlds or heinrich) you will or won't make a pr
20:58 < Learath2> an upgrade to sdl2 2.0.9 fixed my own build, but it also suffers from the slo-mo sound
20:59 <@Dune> ChillerDragon: push to your repo, it takes a few seconds
21:00 < Learath2> is it normal that a ./bam client doesn't copy over the assets?
21:00 <@Dune> yeah
21:00 <@Dune> need to do bam conf=game to make it run everything
21:02 <@Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything
21:02 < Learath2> I wonder what makes sound choppy on mac
21:03 < ChillerDragon> Dune it is in a dirty state in the clone of heinrichs repo
21:04 < ChillerDragon> I wanted to rework it and check everything manually before i publish it somewhere
21:04 <@Dune> you can always rework it afterwards, but ok
21:04 < Oy> Learath2: do u have micro laggs on mac with sdl 2.0.9 and vsync enabled?
21:04 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1693
21:05 < Learath2> none at all
21:05 < Oy> good
21:05 < Learath2> but the sound is extremely choppy
21:06 < Oy> so just windows has the laggs
21:06 < Oy> that's odd
21:06 < Oy> all sound? music too?
21:06 < Learath2> especially obvious on the music
21:06 < Learath2> but all sound yes
21:06 < Oy> ok
21:06 < Oy> do u run mojave?
21:07 < Learath2> yep
21:07 < Oy> ok
21:09 < Learath2> Does heinrich have a mac developer certificate for teeworlds?
21:10 < Oy> hm, dunno
21:10 < Oy> but didn't set a signature https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/0.6/other/bundle/client/Info.plist.in#L15
21:14 < Learath2> Well the dmg you have on github worked once but now it seems broken, keeps saying the file is damaged
21:17 < Oy> that's strange
21:18 < minus> Dune: upload what files though?
21:18 < minus> Dune: surely not the RC?
21:19 <@Dune> not?
21:19 <@Dune> well I can keep the github links I guess, but the downloads are on teeworlds.com
21:19 <@Dune> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=downloads
21:19 < minus> the releases are
21:20 <@Dune> 0.5 trunk was
21:20 <@Dune> I think 0.6 trunk was too then was replaced by 0.6.0 (?)
21:21 < ChillerDragon> Learath2 here for you <3 https://github.com/ChillerDragon/teeworlds/tree/pr_cmake
21:21 <@Dune> yes it was
21:23 < Learath2> ChillerDragon: thanks
21:23 < Learath2> and it doesn't work :P
21:23 < minus> Dune: uploaded them
21:23 <@Dune> thanks minus
21:23 < Learath2> Tons of file COPY cannot find...
21:24 <@Dune> what about the links?
21:24 <@Dune> I guess I can infer them
21:24 <@Dune> alright, works :)
21:26 < Oy> on a mac with highsierra the sound seems good and the dmg as well
21:26 < ChillerDragon> Oh you want to actually do that Learath2
21:26 < ChillerDragon> sorry i could have assumed that
21:26 < ChillerDragon> https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/pull/16
21:26 < ChillerDragon> instructions are here
21:27 <@Dune> updated links
21:27 < ChillerDragon> Uhm https://github.com/heinrich5991/teeworlds/pull/16/commits/ce6e139696e2e0c256d5c47463c74e9af201631a
21:28 < ChillerDragon> Why are the submodules listed there?
21:28 < ChillerDragon> Shoudlnt they be ignored or something like that?
21:30 < Learath2> ChillerDragon: http://codepad.org/RHwQu1tx
21:31 < Learath2> submodule upgrades are just 1 line changes that change the commit they refer to, which you can see in that commit aswell, 2 changes, 1 line removed 1 line added
21:31 < ChillerDragon> hm
21:32 < ChillerDragon> Did you use my other folder?
21:32 < ChillerDragon> brew install libwave
21:32 < ChillerDragon> could help
21:32 <@Dune> you messed up the commit ChillerDragon
21:32 <@Dune> you need to git submodule update
21:32 < ChillerDragon> libwav *
21:33 <@Dune> make a git status to check what you're adding before doing a git commit -a
21:33 < ChillerDragon> yes
21:33 < ChillerDragon> Thats why it doesnt take seconds to upload the stuff
21:33 <@Dune> and that should be fixed before merge
21:33 < ChillerDragon> Im in bed already Learath just wanted something i expect a mess
21:33 < Learath2> well it does when you learn more git :)
21:33 < Learath2> anyways, doesn't really matter now does it, I just wanted to check out what you tried
21:34 < ChillerDragon> is it working now?
21:34 < ChillerDragon> did u brew install some libs
21:34 < ChillerDragon> oh and did u clone -recursive?
21:35 < Learath2> I do have the files there so I guess I did
21:36 < Learath2> let me re clone this, this copy is just way too old :P
21:37 <@Dune> someone should draw an artist forum icon, Sonix looks naked without one
21:37 <@Dune> but I guess that's part of PunBB magic only minus has access to anyway
21:39 < ChillerDragon> So what did i do wrong Dune
21:39 < ChillerDragon> why did the submodules show up there?
21:45 <@Dune> because you did a git commit -a without checking
21:45 <@Dune> always do a git status to see what you are adding
21:46 < rand> commit -p ftw
21:47 < ChillerDragon> git status doesnt help if there is stuff that i dont want
21:47 < ChillerDragon> git submodule update did the job btw
21:47 <@Dune> git status helps you see there is stuff that you don't want
21:47 <@Dune> that's the point
21:47 < ChillerDragon> yes i know
21:48 < ChillerDragon> But i was asking why it was there at all not if it is there
21:48 < ChillerDragon> nvm i fixed it now i guess
21:52 <@Dune> because the submodules were updated on the github side but not on yours
