12:23 < pinkieval> Stitch626: any idea what happened to the Infc Discord group?
12:23 < pinkieval> A few people (including me) can't see it
13:09 < Stitch626> this channel isnt meant to discuss about mods, pinkieval. but to answer your question: it has been deleted.
13:17 < pinkieval> I asked here because you're not in #infclass 
13:18 < pinkieval> do you know why it was deleted?
13:20 < Stitch626> because I selected: server settings -> delete server -> wrote the server name -> press big red delete button
13:20 < pinkieval> uh
13:21 < pinkieval> why did you do that?
13:23 < Stitch626> because people like you are annoying me almost all the time and its waste of time to even read comments there.
13:24 < Stitch626> and then people are complaining when I delete spam and its getting called censorship...
13:24 < pinkieval> then you could make me an admin and leave the group
13:26 < Stitch626> we both know that I got the ownership with a reason, idk what it was exactly but necro had a reason to give ME the ownership and not you.
13:26 < Stitch626> so it was my decision, not yours.
