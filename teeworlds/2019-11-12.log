21:49 < eazor> @Dune, hi are there any documenations of the srccode available somewhere?
22:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the code is the documentation xD(sad truth). but you can ask in here for help.
22:13 < Dune> hello eazor 
22:13 < Dune> teeworld does not have much documentation, although the base library is documented
22:13 < Dune> s*
22:15 < Dune> the codebase is light in OOP and that makes reading through it somewhat linear and straight-forward though
22:17 < Dune> it was originally C and is still very C-ish in many ways :)
