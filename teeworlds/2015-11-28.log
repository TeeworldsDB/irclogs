04:49 < allu2> Btw are rcon (console_output_level) verbose levels client specific?
13:04 <@heinrich5991> no
14:20 < WolfAlex_> minus: 51.255.115.89:8301, server breaking rule #2, https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10442
14:20 < WolfAlex_> and dont just ignore me ._.
14:26 < rand> about player number ?
14:45 < WolfAlex_> rand: yup
14:46 < rand> it's a server that can manage 64 players iirc
14:47 < WolfAlex_> yes it is
14:50 < rand> most of clients cannot manage it, that's why max player count is 16. And since the server is not full, it sends less than <16 connected players
14:52 < rand> take a look at https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=114415#p114415
14:53 < WolfAlex_> still breaking the rules, and i can not see an exception for that case
14:59 < rand> so does any ddnet server…
14:59 < WolfAlex_> yup
15:00 < WolfAlex_> does that change what that server is doing?
15:00 < rand> by the way, this server annouce 52/64 players
15:02 < rand> I mean that if you want to ban 51.255.115.89:8301, you'll have to ban all ddnet servers from masterservers
15:03 < WolfAlex_> no i see 15/16 in the players column
15:03 < rand> look at the name
15:05 < WolfAlex_> so i can host a server with sending 15/16 and add the real playercount to the name?
15:06 < WolfAlex_> the name is only meant to be a name, nothing more
15:10 < rand> why do you want too ban so hard 64p servers ?
15:10 < WolfAlex_> no i dont want to ban them, i want clear rules
15:10 < WolfAlex_> and this is the only way
15:12 < rand> so ask for it instead of ask for banning random servers. Or ask why this rule is how it is
15:12 < WolfAlex_> already asked for it
15:12 < WolfAlex_> no change
15:13 < rand> afaik, it's to prevent server to fake player count to take adventage on sort by player count
15:14 < rand> these servers fake player count in order to be compatible with official client 
15:15 < rand> they do not take advantage since they are not full and the player count announced is lower than real player count
15:16 < WolfAlex_> still breaking the rules.
15:20 < rand> …
15:23 < WolfAlex_> i am doing this so i won't spend my time creating a mod, being banned later for breaking that rule - and get the situation clear
15:23 <@heinrich5991> WolfAlex_: announcing less players than you have is OK
15:24 <@heinrich5991> take that as an official statement
15:24 < rand> “the Code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules.” - Hector Barbossa
15:25 < WolfAlex_> heinrich5991: thx, you should add, that if the server is full, it should also accounce a full server ....
15:26 < Learath2> 64p servers prolly already do that
15:26 < EastByte> not all server afaik
15:26 <@matricks> rand: true for most rules
15:27 < Learath2> huh i was pretty sure nearly all 64p servers are based on eeeee's patch which already does that
15:27 < EastByte> Learath2: some mods tried to rewrite it
15:27 < WolfAlex_> in 0.7 it is possible (due to the change that the downloaded map is showing while downloading) to create waiting queues
15:28 < WolfAlex_> *mapname
17:34 < guenstig_werben> ehm about 0.7
17:36 < guenstig_werben> did you think about adding the POSSIBILITY of having N players, and map designers write a meta information how many players should play this map?
18:02 <@matricks> guenstig_werben: a lot to rework todo that
18:03 <@matricks> and it doesn't make that much sense
18:03 <@matricks> now, party
18:11 < fstd> > 6 o'clock
18:11 < fstd> > party
