15:13 < Henningstone> wtf, teeworlds homepage + forum down??
15:13 < Henningstone> "Could not connect: No route to host"
15:16 <@minus> eek
15:16 < Henningstone> means what...? ^^
15:18 <@minus> yes, seems like it's down
15:18 <@minus> the database at least
15:19 < Henningstone> nice :/
15:19 <@minus> where the heck is kottizen
15:19 <@minus> i mean, it wouldn't be a big deal if it was dead, i have a 10h old backup
15:21 < Henningstone> maybe only the host is having trouble? cause now it's completely gone
15:30 <@minus> DNS gone too :D
15:30 < Henningstone> lol, really? xD
15:31 <@minus> well, not teeworlds.com, but kottizen's stuff. makes sense though, if  you look at his DNS config: dig NS kottnet.net @a.gtld-servers.net
15:32 <@minus> i wonder what happened to him, he hasn't been here in 3 months
15:32 < Henningstone> huh, it actually fails to resolve. huh, what happened to him... oO
15:32 < Henningstone> lol. wrote the same :D we are syncronized ^^
16:04 < Henningstone> oh wow, it's back :D didn't realize
