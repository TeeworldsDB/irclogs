06:32 < JulianAssange> minus: --depth 1
09:48 <@matricks> perhaps kick-start teeworlds V2 :)
09:49 < JulianAssange> matricks: first step: rm -rf *?
09:50 <@matricks> JulianAssange: on the current code?
09:50 < JulianAssange> yes
09:50 <@matricks> dunno how I would do it
09:50 <@matricks> it requires some thinking and planning and deciding what to achive with it
09:50 <@matricks> go away from tilemaps perhaps
09:51 <@matricks> more flexible network protocol?
09:51 <@matricks> use existing libs for it?
09:51 <@matricks> I would probably kill most parts of the system.c
09:51 <@matricks> use all the SDL stuff instead
09:51 < JulianAssange> oh..
09:51 <@minus> protobuf?
09:51 < JulianAssange> how about get rid of SDL completely
09:51 <@minus> or even higher level
09:51 <@matricks> JulianAssange: why?
09:52 <@matricks> minus: protobuf is done for reliable communication
09:52 < JulianAssange> use opengl :>
09:53 <@matricks> erh...
09:53  * matricks slaps JulianAssange 
09:53 < JulianAssange> huehue
09:53 <@matricks> why not SDL and OpenGL?
09:53 <@matricks> like we do today?
09:54 <@minus> SDL and OpenGL do different things
09:54 <@matricks> yah
09:54 <@matricks> and SDL2 has fixed loads of issues in sdl
09:54 <@minus> like scancodes
09:55 <@matricks> multiple windows as well
09:56 <@matricks> I've been debating with myself how to actually do graphics if the tilemaps were to be removed
09:58 <@matricks> got no conclusion on that one
09:58 < JulianAssange> don't allow custom maps
09:58 < JulianAssange> make it closed source
09:59 <@matricks> JulianAssange: why?
09:59 < JulianAssange> make it windows only
09:59 <@matricks> JulianAssange: fuck windows
09:59 <@minus> matricks: he's kidding
09:59 < JulianAssange> make it solaris only
09:59 <@matricks> minus: well, he is failing it and not being very funny 
10:00 <@minus> that's a different issue
10:00 < JulianAssange> has anybody here ever actually used solaris
10:05 < JulianAssange> i'll let myself out.
10:05 <@matricks> saved me a kick command
10:05 <@matricks> minus: I've been thinking of how todo maps etc if tilemaps were to be a gonner
10:06 <@matricks> minus: if you should just model them in a app like blender or something
10:08 <@minus> matricks: have you ever played soldat?
10:08 <@matricks> yes
10:08 <@minus> it has decent map thingie
10:08 <@matricks> looks like hell tho
10:08 <@minus> (except somewhat buggy collision detection)
10:08 <@minus> what do you mean?
10:09 <@matricks> the game doesn't look good
10:09 <@minus> well, it wasn't done by a pro like you
10:10 <@minus> it's spaghetti code done by a single polish noob programmer in 2002 and then some australian ass dumped features upon features onto it
10:10 <@matricks> heh
10:10 <@minus> but it was a hell lot of fun to play
10:11 <@matricks> I think I would change a lot of how the is played for a V2 as well
10:11 <@matricks> think current as quake 1 and V2 as quake 3
10:11 <@matricks> a tad slower and not as extreme speeds
10:11 <@matricks> perhaps put a bit more platforming in the movement
10:12 <@minus> platforming in the movement?
10:12 <@matricks> yeah, less flying around with the hook and never touch ground :)
10:12 <@minus> so more like soldat :D
10:13 <@minus> where you bounce off the ground to gain speed
10:13 <@matricks> sound like skiiing
10:13 <@matricks> (tribes term)
10:13 <@minus> more like bunny hopping
10:14 <@minus> there's this trick called cannon ball in soldat. you do a backflip and use your jets and you fire away
10:14 <@matricks> I tried out jetpack in teeworlds way back
10:14 <@matricks> didn't really like it
10:15 <@matricks> and all the variations of the hook...
10:15 <@matricks> like, a hook that doesn't pull at all
10:15 <@matricks> so you have to swing etc
10:19 <@minus> having no acceleration slows down gameplay quite a lot though
10:19 <@minus> anyway, i prefer a jetpack over the hook
10:20 <@matricks> there are other movement options to try out as well
10:20 <@matricks> but one big thing in platforming games is how to move in the vertical direction
10:20 <@minus> like gravity granades?
10:21 <@matricks> minus: dashing, sprinting, other ideas
10:21 <@matricks> wall jumping
10:21 <@minus> wall jumping is a good one
10:21 <@matricks> introducing platforms that you can jump up to from below
10:21 <@minus> but requires tight levels
10:21 <@matricks> minus: that has been done in teeworlds before :)
10:21 <@minus> :D
10:22 <@minus> have you played N?
10:22 <@matricks> yes
10:22 <@minus> the flash game
10:22 <@minus> man, it's been many years since i played all that stuff
10:22 <@matricks> there are console versions now etc that are touched up and really nice
10:23 <@minus> mh
10:24 <@minus> never had a console besides a GBC (and second hand mega drive)
10:24 <@matricks> there are also map elements you can play with for vertical movement and horizontal speed
10:25 <@minus> jump pads?
10:25 <@matricks> jump pads, air flows, gravity reversals
10:25 <@matricks> speed zones
10:25 <@matricks> portals
10:25 <@minus> i actually prefer less such options and giving that power to the character directly
10:25 <@matricks> can be combination of both, just saying that there is loads of more exprimentation that could be done
10:26 <@matricks> wall running?
10:26 <@minus> would be fun
10:26 <@matricks> and like I said, the classical platforms that you can jump on from below
10:26 <@matricks> that only have collision downwards
10:28 <@matricks> could do weird shit and endless/cyclic levels
10:29 <@matricks> *weird shit like
10:29 <@matricks> that could solve some vertical issues as well
10:29 <@matricks> and non-euclidian space
10:31 <@minus> L_infty distance metric?
10:31 <@matricks> huh?
10:32 <@minus> it's a distance metric where only the longer direction is used as distance
10:32 <@matricks> oh
10:32 <@matricks> I have some realyl weird portal/non-euclidian/gravity things that could be tried out
10:33 <@minus> going right, then going left leads elsewhere?
10:33 <@matricks> not really
10:33 <@matricks> but going right ends you up walking unside down on the roof
10:33 <@matricks> continuing and you end up on the floor again
10:33 <@minus> or compressed space
10:34 <@minus> lots fancy/mindfucking things can be done
10:34 <@minus> i think there was some game that did space stretching and shrinking
10:34 <@matricks> you can do a lot of that with seemless portals
10:34 <@minus> seamless portals?
10:35 <@matricks> think portals portals.. but you don't see them
10:35 <@matricks> there is some youtube videos showing this in some engine

10:36 < Nimda3> [YouTube] Title: Non-Euclidean Level Design (Portal 2 Version) | Rating: 4.97/5.00 | Views: 412,610
10:36 <@matricks> shows off some stuff as well
10:36 <@matricks> that is done by placing planes that acts as portals
10:37 <@matricks> I've been thinking of that in 2d
10:38 <@matricks> wow, that portal 2 stuff actually shows the walking on to the roof thing as well
10:38 <@matricks> that I just came up for as an example
10:40 <@matricks> the portal 2 version shows how it's done as well
10:40 <@matricks> oh.. antichamber is the game that plays with this
10:45 <@minus> hm, i don't quite see how it works, warping the user without them noticing?
10:54 <@minus> i guess if you're not limited to the source engine you can do even fancier stuff
11:21 <@matricks> minus: or or less
11:21 <@matricks> *more or less
11:24 <@minus> matricks: when do we start?
11:24 <@matricks> with teeworlds v2 kickstart? :)
11:26 <@matricks> you have no idea the amount of hops I have to jump through to do that
11:26 <@matricks> or just quit work
11:26 <@matricks> or change work
11:26 <@minus> ^^
12:28 < JulianAssange> i += 1; is the same as i = i+1 ?
12:28 <@matricks> yes
12:40 <@minus> it's different from i++; though
12:41 <@matricks> the ++ operator is something that should perhaps be removed...
12:43 <@minus> or at least do +=1 and nothign else
13:31 < JulianAssange> how come it's different to i++?
14:31 <@minus> you can overload operator++() and make it do something entirely different
15:04 <@matricks> you can overload () >.<
15:04 < JulianAssange> ()._>.<_.()
15:04 < JulianAssange> it's a cat
15:35 < BotoX> can you overload the cat
15:35 < BotoX> what happens if you do so?
15:36 < JulianAssange> kitty will cry
15:41 < BotoX> lolwhat
15:41 < BotoX> windows xp setup has music
16:37 < JulianAssange> BotoX: why are you installing wxp
16:37 < BotoX> legacy applications
16:39 < JulianAssange> btw, people actually do still use solaris: http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-devel/2015-February/029507.html
17:16 <@minus> matricks: how is that a problem, it gives you functors!
17:31 < JulianAssange> http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/18/apple_patent_mounted_iphone_headset_face/
17:31 < JulianAssange> lol
17:31 <@matricks> hmm
17:31 <@matricks> that stuff has already been made
17:32 <@matricks> and products on the market
17:34 < JulianAssange> i think it uses the camera so you can "see through" it when you're not using it 
17:34 < JulianAssange> hurts my eyes just thinking about it
17:35 <@matricks> why?
17:35 <@matricks> augmented reality is a thing
17:35 < JulianAssange> it still hurts my eyes
17:36 <@matricks> heh
17:36 <@matricks> why?
17:36 <@matricks> have you tried any VR googles?
17:36 < JulianAssange> nope
17:37 <@matricks> eyes hurting isn't the problem with em
17:37 < JulianAssange> you don't have them on for hours
17:37 < JulianAssange> (i don't think)
17:37 < JulianAssange> and you don't look at something through a camera, which is blurry, etc.
17:38 <@matricks> and I don't think that is for having on you for very long time either
17:39 <@matricks> JulianAssange: and why would it be blury?
17:39 <@matricks> you are jumping to such conclusions I don't even know
17:40 < JulianAssange> because a camera when moving is blurry
17:40 < JulianAssange> i assume this is to be won like google glass
17:40 <@matricks> JulianAssange: erh.. all depends on the shutter speed etc
17:40 <@matricks> not all cameras get blur when moving
17:40 <@matricks> also.. so does your eyes
17:40 < JulianAssange> "Tired of having to move your arm slightly and make a tedious grabbing action each and every time you pick up your iPhone? Apple has the answer: a wireless display that enables you to mount your device on your face, according to a recently discovered patent." <- this is why i assumed it is for wearing for a long time
17:41 <@matricks> and that is something the writer has written
17:42 < JulianAssange> idk
17:42 < JulianAssange> i don't care
17:42 < JulianAssange> i won't be using it lol
17:42 <@matricks> you say that now
17:43 <@matricks> VR is like one of the final screens
17:43 <@matricks> infinitly big screen
17:43 < JulianAssange> >apple
17:44 < JulianAssange> i'll stick to my sunglasses  https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10968360_10152591884777204_7550830600005482669_n.jpg?oh=bdf71063df94c46ad2cf9a062f9edeb2&oe=559543B2&__gda__=1430917325_39d2d7fae54a9f3e366a28e8253cc0fd
17:45 <@matricks> apple was really good for awhile, might come back to that
17:45 < JulianAssange> matricks: apple are the  new IBM
17:48 < JulianAssange> microsoft are getting pretty good though i think
17:48 < JulianAssange> starting to care about sec. stuff, etc.
17:49 < JulianAssange> and ibm is dead, so who cares
19:59 < JulianAssange> matricks: speaking o f which, this just came through on bugtraq: http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/534728/30/0/threaded
20:01 <@matricks> hehe
20:01 <@matricks> I sit in the same channel as the libcurl developer
20:18 <@minus> who's the libcurl dev?
20:18 <@minus> and what channel is it
20:18 <@matricks> minus: swedish channel over at freenode
20:18 <@minus> and where are my cookies
20:18 <@minus> #haxx?
20:18  * matricks tosses a clay cookie jar on minus 
20:19 <@matricks> minus: no.. ##kodapor
20:19 <@matricks> minus: code monkeys
20:19 <@minus> you know the jonathan coulton song?
20:19 <@matricks> seriously?
20:19 <@matricks> real fucking mature dude
20:20 <@minus> what?
20:20 < JulianAssange> he's talking to me
20:20 <@minus> what
20:21 <@matricks> minus: he joined the freenode channel and just typed this
20:21 <@matricks> 20:19 < MegaManSec> you suck matricks
20:21 <@matricks> and left
20:21 < megamansec> my last ip :(
20:21 <@minus> lol, kids
20:23 <@minus> so, matricks, ready for our non-euclidean game?
20:23 <@matricks> that guy has been going on my nerve for a while now
20:23 <@matricks> minus: to make it? :)
20:23 <@minus> yes!
20:23 <@matricks> hehe
20:24 <@minus> doing a game project might be fun for a change
20:25 <@matricks> too many projects :
20:25 <@matricks> :/
20:25 <@matricks> too little time... and too little energy :/
20:25 <@minus> oh, i have a bunch too
20:25 <@minus> yes
20:25 <@minus> i blame work
20:25 <@matricks> I can't do game stuff as well
20:26 <@minus> halving work ours would probably work
20:27 <@minus> except i'm already doing that to fill the other half with uni
20:27 <@matricks> btw, I have application concept that would get me rich!
20:27 <@minus> :o
20:27 <@matricks> thinking of kickstarting it
20:28 <@minus> going self-employed?
20:28 <@matricks> spare-time project :)
20:28 <@minus> can you reduce work hours in your job?
20:28 <@matricks> not really
20:29 <@minus> areyou a lead dev?
20:29 <@matricks> naa
20:29 <@matricks> but I don't need to reduce my working hours for this project :)
20:29 <@matricks> wanna hear it?
20:31 <@minus> of course :)
20:31 <@matricks> you know how you have a trashbin to throw files into right?
20:32 <@minus> yes, i always bypass that
20:32 <@minus> (i like to shoot myself in the foot)
20:32 < LittleWhite> minus: Upload it on YT, it will work fine :D
20:32 < LittleWhite> (the shooting in your foot)
20:32 <@minus> ._.
20:32 < botnik> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=._.
20:33 <@matricks> well, that is not environmental! my app is going to give you several different bins for different files like documents, movies, music so they can be recycled. This app is going to be fee, then I'm gonna charge for the premium app which has an AutoBin which does the sorting automaticlly!
20:33 <@matricks> it's genius!
20:33 <@minus> o…k?
20:33 < chsk> what
20:34 <@minus> i see how this could get you 5 sales, but not more
20:34 <@matricks> minus: because people are stupid, thats why!
20:34 <@matricks> http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/02/19/sony-to-offer-premium-sound-memory-card/
20:34 <@matricks> I mean.. come on
20:34 <@minus> good point
20:35 <@minus> actually there's premium HDMI cables
20:35 <@matricks> dude, there is optical cables with gold plating
20:35 <@minus> lol
20:36 <@matricks> you don't think I would be able to sell that? :D
20:37 <@minus> yeah, do it
20:37 <@minus> make it a case study
20:37 <@minus> and get rich as a side effect
20:39 <@minus> damn, i'm so bored
20:39 <@matricks> same, but I can't bring my self todo anything
20:40 <@matricks> think I'm gonna go to bed soon, kinda tired
20:42 <@minus> :/
20:44 < rayv> Have You tried GoLang? Is it worth learning?
20:44 <@minus> Go a shit
20:44 <@minus> i heard the error handling is not so good
20:45 <@matricks> rayv: know of it, not used it
