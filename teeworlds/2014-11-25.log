12:44 <@matricks> anyone wanna answer? :D https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11203
15:44 < Dune> yo
15:44 <@matricks> YO YO YO
15:44 < Dune> does anyone know how the #include "SDL.h" work here: https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds/blob/master/src/engine/client/sound.cpp
15:44 <@matricks> like normal?
15:44 < Dune> I'd understand if it was <SDL.h>, but this is weird
15:44 <@matricks> it searches for it?
15:45 <@matricks> Dune: dude
15:45 <@matricks> Dune: the behaviour of #include <> vs "" is not defined
15:45 < Dune> oh, ok
15:46 <@matricks> "" will check system paths as well
15:46 < Dune> i suddenly hit a "no such file or folder" and don't know what to look for since I didn't understand how it could work in the first place
15:46 < Dune> alright, so I just have to make sure SDL is installed on the system
15:46 <@matricks> ya
15:46 < Dune> nice, thanks
15:46 <@matricks> trying to dig out the specs
15:48 <@matricks> <> A preprocessing directive of the form <> searches a sequence of implementation-defined places for a header identified uniquely by the specified
15:48 <@matricks> sequence between the < and > delimiters, and causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the header. How the places are specified or the header identified is implementation-defined.
15:49 <@matricks> A preprocessing directive of the form "" causes the replacement of that directive by the entire contents of the source file identified by the specified
15:49 <@matricks> sequence between the " delimiters. The named source file is searched for in an implementation-defined manner. If this search is not supported, or if the search fails, the directive is reprocessed as if it read <> with the identical contained sequence (including > characters, if any) from the original directive
15:49 <@matricks> so "" acts one way, if it doesn't find the file, it will behave like <>
15:49 < laxadedi> nice to learn thast :)
15:50 < laxadedi> *that
15:50 <@matricks> the things between < and > doesn't even have to be a filename
16:01 < Dune> oh, hence the <iostream> and such
16:01 < Dune> thanks, TIL
16:51 < heinrich5991> and I thought "" means local directory vs <> all include paths
16:51 <@matricks> nope
17:45 <@minus> dito
17:45 <@minus> also, iostream _is_ a file
17:48 < heinrich5991> yea, found that out one day too :)
