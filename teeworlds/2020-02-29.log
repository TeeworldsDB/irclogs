00:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah regex for tokenization ðŸ˜®

00:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, if one does not care about performance at all
00:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> use python ðŸ˜„
00:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> with regex
00:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> no in python I use the tokenizer of sklearn or spacy
00:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> to split string
00:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> bette rthan a whole state machine ._.
00:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> finite state machine
00:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> there are dynamic and static tokenizers
00:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i  can give you literature if you want
11:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> why is there a check whether client is ingame and not quitting in the loop BUT NOT for a single send? this could remove all the checks from where we call SendPackMsg and would be nicer in general

12:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> you can tell me the isbn
12:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ISBN
12:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> opening an issue leads to better results, as discussions here don't seem to lead to any change of such small, but imo important refactoring changes.
12:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Probably because packet.m_clientid has a sane value if SendMsg is called
12:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Additional checks wouldn't hurt ig
12:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it doesnt have to have a sane value
12:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> can pass any client id you want
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but it assumes it is sane
14:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
