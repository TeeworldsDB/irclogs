13:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> redix already said all the important stuff
17:09 < redix> one more thing about race... what about ranking stuff? I have never been a big fan of the top5 display used in any race gametype today. A graphical interface instead of /top5 and /rank would be cool. On the other hand, to my mind the whole ranking thing does not really fit together with the simplicity of the game. When I think of official tw racing, it would be some round based gametype which does not need any ranking. What do you guys think 
17:09 < redix> about this?
17:14 < Dune> redix, maybe we can somehow recycle the scoreboard or statboard UI
17:20 < redix> my question is rather, whether there should be support for this at all :D
17:21 < redix> this is a bit more than basic support 
17:21 < Dune> it would be very easy to support it with the chat commands 
17:21 < Dune> but it is questionable whether it should be, yes
17:22 < Dune> chat commands have the benefit of retrocompatibility; older versions can just use the chat
17:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> as in every race you should be able to see leaderboards, imo
17:26 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> its an incentive to improve your runs and time
