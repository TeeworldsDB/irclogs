17:33 < heinrich5991> can someone connect to the 5.166.x.y server in the server list?
17:35 < Henningstone> "you are banned until you die" ?! xDD
17:36 < Henningstone> the server shows 0/0 players and 999 ping
17:37 < Henningstone> so no, I cannot connect ;)
17:40 < rand> neither do i
17:44 < heinrich5991> ok, wondering if it's just me, but apparantly it's not
17:44 < heinrich5991> thanks
17:45 < Henningstone> ah so this server is not anything you're testing? :) just thought so
17:47 < Stitch626> heinrich: this server faked if-city, or not? (proxy-mod)
17:49 < rand> remember the idea of a bot trying to connect to each vanilla serv to do some basic tests (ie tuning) and if the tests fail, it can assume a fake vanilla
17:50 < rand> but seems a bit useless anyway
17:50 < rand> no idea if there is a lot of fake vanilla server
17:53 < heinrich5991> Stitch626: you can see something? what does it show?
17:55 < Henningstone> hm, I'm quite curious about this server. It also doesn't answer ping requests :0
17:56 < Henningstone> could be the case if it is a private (local) server...
17:57 < Henningstone> ah, it's a russian server... ^^ 5x166x131x170.dynamic.spb.ertelecom.ru
17:57 < Stitch626> i'm actually talking about this srv with heinrich
17:58 <@minus> was that the password-stealing proxy that WolfAlex_ banned?
18:00 < Stitch626> yep
18:05 < Stitch626> maybe should this server banned from masterserver?
18:07 <@minus> yeah
18:07 <@minus> gimme the ip
18:07 < Henningstone> 5.166.131.170
18:07 <@minus> there, it's on the shit list
18:07 < heinrich5991> with a comment and a date, hopefully :P
18:07 < Stitch626> hehe, i like the word "shit list" :)
18:08 < Henningstone> er, are you done? should it be gone now?
18:09 <@minus> no date, just comment
18:09 <@minus> no, it'll take a while, Henningstone
18:10 <@minus> maybe i should try writing the master in erlang :D
18:11 < WolfAlex_> minus: yes
18:11 < WolfAlex_> but i think that ip is a home connection
18:11 <@minus> well, he's banned from playing teeworlds now
18:12 <@minus> *evil laughter*
18:12 < Henningstone> xD
18:12 < Stitch626> xD
18:12 <@minus> DxD
18:13 < Stitch626> bad minus, don't be so evil ;)
18:19 < Henningstone> How long does it take until he is gone? I'm just wondering that he's still there :3
18:20 <@minus> ban file is reloaded every 30 minutes
18:20 <@minus> masterserver reloads the file ever 10 minutes
18:20 <@minus> it's very hacky
18:20 < Henningstone> ah ok, thanks :)
18:21 <@minus> hence, erlang
18:21 <@minus> i don't know the language but people keep telling me it's cool
18:25 < heinrich5991> Rust! :P
18:26 <@minus> not as cool
18:26 <@minus> but a valid option
20:24 < Henningstone> wow, there is a server with the name "<spaaaaaces> EXCESSIVE SPACES RUIN THE LIST" :DD
21:28 < Stitch626> hm, the creator was bored?
