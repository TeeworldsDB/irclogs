14:08 <@heinrich5991> matricks: could chunk headers be cut down a byte by only mentioning the first sequence number in each packet?
14:19 <@matricks> heinrich5991: yes
14:19 <@matricks> sequence number could go into the packet header
14:21 < EastByte> any reasons against doing that?
14:21 < EastByte> it would strip quite a few bytes
14:21 <@matricks> nope
14:22 <@matricks> dunno how much messier the code becomes if at all
14:29 < EastByte> meh, private messages on teeworlds.com really aren't noticable
14:42 < Flutterbat> at least messier 42 ... :X
