00:17 <@minus> heinrich5991: wanna create an issue about dual stack?
12:30 <@minus> might be not bad to give the issues priorities, there's quite many after all
12:40 < JulianAssange> some bugs could probably be closed, e.g. https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1210
12:40 < JulianAssange> looks like a bug in [dd]race
13:06 <@minus> closed
13:06 <@matricks> minus: wanna see an awesome white christmas picture? :D
13:07 <@minus> matricks: i'd like to see some of those 150 open issues for teeworlds closed
13:07 <@matricks> http://flightlog.org/fl_b5/flimg.html?id=70263
13:07 <@minus> quite cloudy
13:08 <@minus> nice
13:08 <@matricks> quite awesome :D
13:08 <@matricks> got video of it as well
13:08 <@matricks> but my laptop charger is borken... and my laptop might be fried as well :((((((
13:08 < JulianAssange> what is that at the bottom of the pic?
13:08 < JulianAssange> wait
13:08 < JulianAssange> is that the front of the plane?
13:08 <@matricks> my pod
13:08 < EastByte> cold out there?
13:08 <@matricks> kinda
13:09 < JulianAssange> what is a pod?
13:09 <@matricks> http://flightlog.org/fl_b5/flimg.html?id=70280
13:09 < JulianAssange> ah
13:09 <@matricks> http://flightlog.org/fl_b5/flimg.html?id=70362
13:09 <@matricks> :)
13:09 < JulianAssange> hard?
13:10 <@matricks> easy to fly, hard to do it well :)
13:10  * minus np: Perrra - Nu är det sommar igen
13:10 <@matricks> http://flightlog.org/fl_b5/flimg.html?id=70279
13:10 <@minus> oh god, swedish scene pop
13:10 <@matricks> minus: lol
13:10 < JulianAssange> atleast it's not Kpop
13:11 < JulianAssange> http://flightlog.org/fl_b5/flimg.html?id=70279 <- is that taking off?
13:11 <@minus> i don't listen to kpop, but it can't possibly be as gay as this
13:12 <@minus> more like landing
13:12 <@matricks> JulianAssange: yeah, got suprised by the updraft
13:12 <@matricks> and got picked up before I wanted to
13:12 <@minus> damn
13:12 < JulianAssange> lmao
13:12 < EastByte> so you are starting without being pulled by something?
13:12 <@matricks> yeah, from a mountain
13:12 < EastByte> ah okay
13:13 <@matricks> which is the most common way
13:14 <@minus> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/labels i'd like some feedback on the labels, some are somewha ambiguous, like "code"
13:18 < JulianAssange> code refactoring?
13:18 <@minus> i've understood it as "involves work on code"
13:19 < JulianAssange> task is something i don't understand though
13:19 <@minus> refactoring should be a separate label
13:20 <@minus> i've understood "task" as something that is already clearly defined and just has to be done
13:20 < JulianAssange> how do i even add alabel to my own issues?
13:20 <@minus> dunno if you can
13:20 < JulianAssange> oh well
13:21 <@minus> github issues are rather limited
13:21 <@minus> esp. when you're used to working with jira
13:22 < JulianAssange> this is probably the main 'refactor' too: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1240
13:23 <@minus> dunno if i'd call SDL2 support refactor
13:23 <@matricks> more of an upgrade
13:24 < JulianAssange> that's what refactor means, no?
13:24 <@minus> well, it's changing a library, not only the code
13:24 <@matricks> moving code around
13:24 <@minus> it comes with external changes too
13:24 < JulianAssange> mm
13:24 <@minus> refactoring is reorganizing code
13:25 < JulianAssange> hanging logic, i guess
13:25 < JulianAssange> changing*
13:36 < JulianAssange> minus: I think the wavpack/all other libraries should be updated
13:36 <@minus> ok, "code" means it involves code, as opposed to https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/11 for example
13:36 <@minus> JulianAssange: gather a few more details, make an issue
13:43 < JulianAssange> http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11323558/Anti-terror-plan-to-spy-on-toddlers-is-heavy-handed.html lol
15:19 < Learath2> minus: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/354
15:22 <@minus> Learath2: ?
15:26 < Learath2> clan and country flag is already in and the rest was already decided not to be added iirc
15:26 <@minus> closed
15:28 <@minus> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1042 this needs someone to draw the flag, right?
15:28 < heinrich5991> minus: yes
15:29 < heinrich5991> it shouldn't be that hard I guess
15:29 < heinrich5991> though it would be best if Landil did it
15:29 < heinrich5991> (our graphics have a bus factor of 1 btw)
15:29 <@minus> a lot of stuff has
15:29 <@minus> some even has bus factor 0
15:30 <@matricks> close that bug, it shouldn't be added
15:30 <@minus> trying to find a way to assign it to landil
15:30 <@matricks> it's not in the standard
15:30 <@minus> good point
15:30 < heinrich5991> if it's not, don't add it
15:31 <@minus> if you do not strictly follow the standard, you get into politics there
15:31 < heinrich5991> yup
15:31 < heinrich5991> which standard are we following?
15:31 <@minus> what standard is it?
15:31 <@minus> :D
15:31 <@matricks> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2
15:32 <@matricks> I think...
15:32 <@minus> i've found a similar thing in the code
15:32 <@minus> const char *paIndices[NUM_INDICES] = {"custom", "ISO 3166-1"};
15:32 <@matricks> Palestine is actually in there
15:33 <@minus> yeah
15:33 <@minus> since 1999 even
15:33 <@matricks> wonder where I got that it isn't in :/
15:34 <@minus> is it a country?
15:34 < heinrich5991> The State of Palestine[i] (Arabic: دولة فلسطين‎ Dawlat Filasṭīn) is a de jure sovereign state in the Middle East.[14][15]
15:35 < heinrich5991> -      Sovereignty dispute with Israel     Ongoingc[iii][6][7] 
15:35 < heinrich5991> On 29 November 2012, in a 138-9 vote (with 41 abstentions and 5 absences),[28] the United Nations General Assembly passed resolution 67/19, upgrading Palestine from an "observer entity" to a "non-member observer state" within the United Nations system, which was described as recognition of the PLO's sovereignty.[14][15][29][30][31]
15:37 <@matricks> it's in our list as well that is the ISO 3166-1, so the flag should be added
15:40 <@minus> updated the issue
15:40 <@minus> now that most of the issues are labelled some version planning would be nice
15:41 <@minus> there's already a ton of issues with the milestone 0.7
15:41 <@minus> maybe we should make it 2 milestones, 0.7-mandatory and 0.7-optional
15:42 <@minus> more like 0.7 and 0.8 though
15:53 < EastByte> welcome to our side!
16:12 <@minus> wow, github recognizes [ ] and [x]
16:12 <@minus> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/814
16:59 <@minus> i now know something noone else does. all open issues.
17:11 < EastByte> glad to hear :)
17:20 < heinrich5991> minus: what does the code label mean?
17:20 <@minus> code-related
17:20 <@minus> could be kind of implcit, because very few things are non code related
17:28 <@minus> is there any roadmap/plan for 0.7?
17:29 <@minus> what things to include, etc
17:36 < heinrich5991> minus: I don't think there's an explicit plan :/
17:36 < heinrich5991> new UI
17:36 < heinrich5991> new server browser
17:36 < heinrich5991> new skin system
17:36 <@minus> i just added a few things to the milestone
19:42 < EastByte> meh too many github notifications
19:44 < BotoX> ^
19:45 < heinrich5991> oh fuck, activity!
19:46 < BeaR_> issue list so colorful \o
19:47 < BeaR_> good job!
19:49 <@minus> thank you
19:49 <@minus> now we just need a roadmap for 0.7
19:49 <@minus> how many emails did yo uget, EastByte?
19:49 <@minus> i edited over 100 issues
19:49 < EastByte> too many
19:50 < EastByte> ~60 actually
19:51 < EastByte> minus: are you going to end the never ending story (0.7)? :)
19:51 < heinrich5991> we already broke the pyramid of doom, twice :)
19:51 < BeaR_> ^^
19:52 < heinrich5991> http://teedune.wordpress.com/2011/08/15/about-the-next-official-teeworlds/
19:52 <@minus> pyramid of doom?
19:52 < EastByte> isn't that js related?
19:52 <@minus> i see
19:52 < EastByte> okay
19:54 < heinrich5991> "Uh, yeah 0.7.0 will be realesed in 2012, so let me think, jeah and 0.8.0 in 2013."
19:55 < heinrich5991> ... :D
19:55 < m80116> importat thing is thay do things properly
19:55 < m80116> for me the game it's already perfect the way it is
19:55 < m80116> what I'd want is new CTF Vanilla maps
19:55 <@minus> how about a 6-week cycles for major releases
19:56 < m80116> designed the proper way
19:56 < BeaR_> 0.10 incoming !
19:59 < heinrich5991> let's go firefox :D
19:59 < heinrich5991> 0.22.0 by the end of the year
20:02 <@minus> i said major, no minor
20:02 < heinrich5991> oh
20:02 < heinrich5991> but isn't TW version scheme 0.major.minor? :)
20:03 <@minus> that's not how it works
20:03 <@minus> oh, 66 open tabs
20:03 <@minus> 666*
21:00 < heinrich5991> today is a good day
21:00 < heinrich5991> rust's `int` and `uint` have been renamed
21:02 <@minus> to?
21:05 < heinrich5991> `isize` and `usize`
21:05 < heinrich5991> but that's kinda irrelevant to me, I like that they're renamed
21:58 < m80116> poop is NotEdible
21:58 < m80116> unless you're coprophagist
22:20 < poop> forgot the phd
22:21 <@minus> PhD poop?
22:21 < poop> i have no idea
22:21 < poop> that was a terrible joke
22:22 < poop> im too tired, you fix it.
22:34 <@matricks> minus: any good idea on how to get data from an ssd that comes from a very very slim laptop? :/
22:35 <@minus> m.2 SSD?
22:35 <@minus> assuming the laptop is bork?
22:35 <@matricks> yeah
22:35 <@matricks> is that what they are called? slim ssd sticks
22:36 <@minus> m.2s are usually just a little pcb
22:36 <@minus> you should be able to find adapters for them for usb
22:36 <@matricks> yeah
22:37 <@matricks> there is m.2 -> sata converters atleast
22:40 <@minus> could could also put it in another laptop
22:40 <@matricks> then.. well. then I need another laptop :)
22:40 <@matricks> oh.. wait.. 
22:40  * matricks goes and fetches one
22:41 <@minus> if it's not too old
22:41 <@minus> m.2 is fairly recent
22:42 <@matricks> sweeet!
22:42 <@matricks> my very old eeepc 901 has m.2
22:43 <@matricks> or..
22:43 <@matricks> not even close.. :)
22:45 < Learath2> matricks: if you have a recent computer your motherboard might have a m.2 slot
22:46 < Learath2> or it might be a msata drive too which is more probable if your laptop was old
22:48 <@matricks> hmmm...
22:50 < Learath2> matricks M2 is stick shaped msata is thicker if you didnt identify it yet
22:50 <@matricks> I have not computers with such connector on the motherboard so
23:16 < BotoX> http://static.myce.com/images_posts/2014/02/myce-Transcend_N8S750_MSA340_01.jpg
23:16 < BotoX> mSATA should be fairly easy to connect
23:16 < BotoX> idk about M2, never even seen those
23:17 <@matricks> it's the m.2 ssd one
23:17 < BotoX> Yeah, I guess you have to buy some kind of adapter pcb or cable
23:17 < BotoX> which isn't expensive if you buy it overseas but the waiting time is high :P

23:21 < Nimda3> [YouTube] Title: Remotely turning a PC on and off | Rating: 0.00/5.00 | Views: 1
23:21 < Kottizen> Just discovered... I know I'm years behind :/
23:22 < BotoX> wait, can you shot down a pc using wol or are you just using ssh?
23:22 <@minus> is your camera a bit dirty maybe?
23:22 < BotoX> let me guess, a htc one
23:22 < BotoX> shitty camera driver
23:23 < BotoX> /firmware
23:24 < Kottizen> HTC One, but it was fine when I first got it
23:24 <@matricks> might have to spend some dough on the converter
23:24 <@matricks> that ssd has some of my best footage on it :/
23:24 < Kottizen> I don't use the camera much, so it doesn't really matter -- think something inside it broke six months ago, or so
23:24 < BotoX> Should be around $10 matricks 
23:24 < Kottizen> BotoX: SSH to power off, yes :/
23:24 <@matricks> more lik e60-70
23:24 <@matricks> more like 60-70

23:25 <@matricks> china...
23:25 < BotoX> it's always from china :D
23:26 <@matricks> I want it this year... not the next decade
23:26 < BotoX> It really depends on how long you want to wait for it
23:26 < BotoX> heh
23:26 < BotoX> gonna take 2-4 weeks
23:26 < Kottizen> I think "I want it" is enough
23:26 < Kottizen> you never know if it arrives when you order from China!
23:26 < BotoX> yeah, true :/
23:28 < BotoX> http://www.amazon.de/dp/B00HKV2TVK germany?
23:29 < BotoX> >No any driver requested!
