15:20 < Java_> Hey guys
15:23 <@minus> hello
15:28 < vali> you looks like creepy
15:31 < Java_> Hello vali
15:31 < vali> hello Java_ 
15:31 < Java_> How comes you are on here, when basically all you and Captain Teemo do is DDos independent Teeworlds hosters?
15:32 < vali> its a mythos
15:32 < Java_> Oh, is it?
15:32 < vali> sure
15:33 < Java_> How comes that basically every person who hosts at least two servers on teeworlds says otherwise?
15:33 < vali> i dont know
15:34 < Java_> Strange coincidences.
15:34 < Learath2> Java_: its simple psychology he just has to brag and watch as others suffer
15:34 < vali> maybe they see vali ghosts?
15:34 < Learath2> some how gives him great pleasure and satisfaction
15:36 < Java_> Yeah, I know.
15:36 < o_be_one> Java_, hes kidding you ...
15:36 < vali> mh serious guys?
15:36 < Java_> He and Captain Teemo are the reason why teeworlds is going down.
15:36 < Java_> Who is kidding me, o_be_one ?
15:36 < o_be_one> yes, add nazar too
15:36 < laxadedi> I would not say this is the only reason, but it's sure is a good one.
15:36 < Java_> Yeah, not to forget that guy.
15:37 < o_be_one> nazar is small but annoying, easy to stop, very
15:37 < o_be_one> he can give his grand mother to get unbanned LOL
15:37 < o_be_one> laxadedi, hes not good, hes just paying some booter with stolen credit card. what a skill !
15:38 < o_be_one> just Twitter is the easyest way to get many credit cards numbers ... Take like 1 min to get just one working !
15:38 < vali> Captain Teemo cant do anything
15:38 < laxadedi> That implies you can, you know that ?
15:38 < o_be_one> Teemo is powerful but i can trust that is actually not in action, hes someone passive, just following friends ...
15:38 < Java_> Everybody knows that Captain Teemo is also responsible for that. His servers are the only ones that ALWAYS stay online.
15:39 < laxadedi> Java_: my servers have never been really attacked, only 5 minutes last friday
15:39 < vali> so where are his server
15:39 < vali> tell me
15:39 < vali> idiot

15:40 < Java_> 130.255.73.197
15:40 < Java_> 130.255.73.70

15:41 < vali> you mean they are everytime online
15:42 < Java_> Teemo's server is always online and that is the one you guys are watching so nicely.
15:42 < Java_> And as I just said: Yours are currently offline because they have already been put on the master server banlist.
15:42 < vali> Java_:  wrong
