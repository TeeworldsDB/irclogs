05:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Nibiru> Sup with masterservers? DoS again?
09:10 < deen> Nibiru: Yes, spam of server registrations from spoofed ips on all master servers, thus real servers get dropped
11:16 <@minus> solution: add proof of work? :D
11:19 <@heinrich5991> blockchain!
11:49  * minus chains heinrich5991 to a block of concrete and drops him in the ocean
11:56  * day throws all existing nade launchers after him to finally balance the game :^)
15:33 < Learath2> proof of work could actually work
15:35 < Learath2> or just challnge response
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Nibiru> I think the masterserver should send info request to server that wants to register, if it receives a correct reply, then the server gets registered
17:36 <@heinrich5991> yes, that'd work as a workaround currently
21:34 <@matricks> erh.. the server does that already
21:34 <@matricks> but that queue might get filled up... should be fixed :/
