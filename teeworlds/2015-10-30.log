12:18 < Obani> Does someone here know how to use the teeworlds editor deeply ?
12:29 <@matricks> well, yes, kinda off, but not really :)
12:29 <@matricks> I wrote the thing way back
12:46 < Obani> Lol yeah that's why I asked the question
12:46 < Obani> I have problems with the editor
12:47 < Obani> I want to change some heights value to quads
12:47 < Obani> But it goes 2 by 2
12:47 < Obani> And I need to change 1 by 1 :/
12:48 < Obani> Cause their is an even value and an odd value
12:49 < Obani> This night
12:49 < Obani> I got another epiphany
12:49 < Obani> Teeworlds has nearly all the elements to make an adventure platform shooter
12:49 < Obani> It just needs IAs that can be taken/tweaked from mods
12:50 < Obani> It has the physics
12:50 < Obani> The weapons
12:50 < Obani> The character system
12:50 < Obani> And a map editor
12:51 < Obani> With interactive maps, it can easily have a singleplayer mode :D
12:51 < heinrich5991> IA? are you french? ^^
12:52 < heinrich5991> perhaps try pressing some combination of ctrl, shift when modifying the quad's height value
12:52 < Obani> AI, sorry :p
12:52 < Obani> heinrich5991, I'll try that
12:56 < Obani> Thanks, it worked :)
12:56 < Obani> (but didn't solve my problem lol)
12:57 < Stitch626> maybe the time's already here? its possible to load and use more as one map in the same time and switch beetwen them.. its possible to do interactive animations via mod edit, its possible to do some interesting things...
13:00 < Obani> Stitch626, what you're telling is interesting
13:00 < Obani> But the problem would be to switch from a map selector to a map
13:01 < Obani> Charging all the features would take too long/be too loud for the processor
13:02 < Obani> But if some mappers/unnoficial_devs want to work on that singleplayer addon, It would be fantastic !
13:02 < Obani> (As I think official devs have other things to do for now :p )
13:04 < Obani> AI would be the thing to work on, to make it a good platform shooter
13:04 < Obani> And as it already has a multiplayer support, it would be possible to create coop :D
13:04 < Stitch626> hm, switching between maps isnt the problem... i know there are mods they loaded (!) more as one map at the same time and its just a little change internal (of the mod) to switch to another map
13:05 < Obani> Stitch626, but wouldn't it be too loud for the computer ?
13:05 < Stitch626> there is a little "hang" on the client when u switch to another map, but nothing more :)
13:06 < Stitch626> nop
13:06 < Stitch626> we don't live in 2000, we have more as anough cpu power
13:06 < Obani> not me :p
13:06 < Stitch626> *e
13:06 < Obani> I live in 2006 :p
13:07 < Stitch626> if you're don't use a pentium 3, u should have enough.
13:07 < Stitch626> 2006 is new enough, i'm in 2008/2009 ;)
13:08 <@matricks> a single player teeworlds would probably look very different from multiplayer
13:08 < Obani> matricks, yes
13:08 <@matricks> there has been design documents and implementations in the past
13:08 <@matricks> like, around 2000
13:09 < Obani> But teeworlds has totally the elements for that :)
13:09 <@matricks> not really
13:09 < Obani> So what is missing ?
13:09 <@matricks> a game? :)
13:09 < Obani> Stitch626, Pentium Dual
13:09 < Obani> matricks, I'm talking about the engine :p
13:09 <@matricks> doing single player is very different from doing multiplayer
13:09 < Stitch626> powerful enough.
13:10 <@matricks> Obani: it has a multiplayer engine, not a single player engine...
13:10 < Obani> matricks, it has a map editor which makes possible the simple creation of levels
13:10 < Obani> matricks, yes, that's true :/
13:10 < Obani> coop ? x)
13:10 <@matricks> the map editor is lacking heavly the stuff needed for single player things
13:11 <@matricks> bascilly lacks everything releated to scripting
13:11 < Obani> If there were bot-ennemies, it would be a great enhancement
13:12 <@matricks> then you end up with a single player like q3a, which is... well.. a bad single player
13:12 < Obani> And we could create a coop vanilla mode :)
13:12 < Stitch626> i've seen some bot AI's over the years ^^
13:12 <@matricks> what teeworlds singleplayer actually is.. well.. isn't defined at all
13:12 <@matricks> people tend to see the possibilities without the obstacles or problems :/
13:12 < Obani> Stitch626, yes, many mods add some bots
13:13 <@matricks> I'm usually the reverse
13:13 < Obani> But they aren't good enough
13:13 <@matricks> I have some keywords that I would use todo a teeworlds singleplayer tho :)
13:13 < Obani> What they do is aiming on the player and shooting
13:13 <@matricks> been thinking of it for a long time
13:14 < Obani> We-need-bots !
13:14 < Obani> lol
13:15 < Stitch626> Obani, i remember there was a ddrace bot in 2010, it was intelligent and able to play ddrace with you :)
13:15 < Obani> afk
13:15 < Obani> Stitch626, who's the mad developper who did this ? 0.o
13:15 < Obani> afk
13:16 < Stitch626> dunno, there was credits but i forget it :/
13:26 < Stitch626> afk too.
13:28  * matricks digs out some old stuff
13:29 <@matricks> http://www.matricks.se/vtech.ogv
13:33 <@matricks> minus: !! :D
13:34 <@matricks> http://matricks.se/tw/teewars.png
13:34 <@matricks> :)
13:37 < Learath2> matricks: did anything ever come from vector based maps ?
13:37 <@matricks> nope
13:37 <@matricks> I did that during a week during a summer
13:37 < Learath2> shame would have been nice :P
13:37 <@matricks> wanna see some other stuff ?:D
13:38 < Learath2> yep
13:38 <@matricks> http://matricks.se/tw/sniperaim.avi
13:39 < Learath2> gives you a zoomed out view ?
13:39 <@matricks> yap
13:39 < Learath2> heh thats cute
13:39 <@matricks> I found some stuff that I think never has been shown before as well
13:39 <@matricks> http://matricks.se/tw/teewars_uber_hooking.avi
13:40 < Learath2> omg teewars gba port :D
13:40 <@matricks> single player
13:41 < Learath2> looks like it could actually be fun
13:43 <@matricks> http://matricks.se/tw/teewars7.ogm
13:43 <@matricks> http://matricks.se/tw/teewars9.ogm
13:43 <@matricks> http://matricks.se/tw/teewars5.ogm
13:43 <@matricks> ahh, the memories
13:45 <@matricks> those ogm videos are dated 2008-01-21 :D
13:45 <@matricks> the teewars.png is 2005 apparently
13:49 < Obani> matricks : old stuff, but impressive :o
13:56 < Obani> afk
14:05 < Obani> matricks, are you really out of dev ? :'(
14:15 <@matricks> yap, since a couple of years back
14:19 < Obani> Are you working on another amazing project ?
14:19 <@matricks> always :)
14:19 <@matricks> and work
14:19 <@matricks> and the paragliding stuff takes a lot of time
14:21 <@matricks> there is still some teeworlds repos that I have some stuff in that never have gotten merged as well
15:08 < day_> matricks: sniper aim...the predecessor of dynamic camera?
15:09 <@matricks> not really
15:11 < day_> those links are awesome
15:21 < Obani> afk for a while
16:11 <@minus> that GBA one is news to me
16:11 <@minus> did you make that, matricks?
16:23 < Stitch626> rly nice
16:28 < Edible> GBA?
16:32 <@minus> gameboy advance
16:36 < Stitch626> ye
16:36 < Stitch626> i still have one (the old one, not the SP)
16:37 <@minus> i still have a GBC
16:37 <@minus> i'd prefer a DMG though
16:37 < Stitch626> my mother have a gb (the old one with black/white display) in grey :D
16:37 <@minus> yeah, the one from 1989
16:38 < Stitch626> ye
16:38 <@minus> GBC is quite a lot newer, 1998, but still practically the same CPU (Z80 variant)
16:38 <@minus> GBA has an ARM CPU
16:38 <@minus> so that's boring
16:38 < Stitch626> i still know the gbc ;)
16:39 < Stitch626> was the first one with external camera :D
16:42 < Obani> I have GB
16:43 < Obani> :)
16:43 < Edible> yeah but, what happened with the GBA?
16:44 < Obani> matricks.se/tw/teewars_uber_hooking.avi
16:45 < Edible> oh nice!
17:11 <@matricks> minus: yes, looong loong time ago
18:15 < Learath2> wait is it actuall gba matricks?
18:15 <@matricks> not really, but built to gba specs
18:15 <@matricks> POC
19:44 < Obani> Is Sonix sometimes on IRC ?
19:44 < Obani> Or does he have another nickname ?
19:54 < Oy> Obani: he uses sonix, not often in irc i think, you could try to contact him via the forum
20:11 < day_> Dunedune: :3
20:11 < Dunedune> Hello
20:56 < tyurd> Oy: referring to https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1408#issuecomment-151577577. I could but i would need help installing SDL.h on my system.
