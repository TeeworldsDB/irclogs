09:38 < Ryozuki> nice idea
09:48 < Ryozuki> Dune are you the one managing teeworlds on steam? i saw there is joystick support, and you can tell steam if your game has controller support. https://i.imgur.com/tahGgXJ.png
09:58 < Dune> Ryozuki, the joystick support is still experimental and not great
09:58 < Dune> Besides a lot of gamepads don't have enough buttons to play teeworlds properly 
09:58 < Dune> So I think it's better not to
10:02 < Ryozuki> i guess
10:41 < day> Ryozuki: i was pretty hyped about controller support, but eh. you will break your fingers on an xbox360 controller trying to play it 
10:42 < day> i think the button quantity would be ok, if you are ok with cycling through weapons instead of direct selection
12:07 < ChillerDragon> Does someone know where to find/contact BeaR/cinaera ?
12:23 < Ryozuki> are there any irc logs
12:52 < Dune> Bear hasn't been around for a while 
13:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Ryozuki https://ddnet.tw/irclogs/ for ddnet https://ddnet.tw/irclogs/teeworlds for teeworlds
13:08 < Ryozuki> ty
15:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> thinking about it, it may make sense to have a server option to export a config
15:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> like setting the configuration ingame, and if finished just export settings
16:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> then you need to remember which settings get changed
16:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> 2 possibilities: compare to default settings, or simply export ALL
16:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> and a generated config is probably cleaner then a handmade one
