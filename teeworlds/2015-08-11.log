12:22 < Savander> matricks, i have a problem with compiling bam with MinGW. http://pastebin.com/2msj2Ju0 Maybe you know, what i should do?
12:23 <@matricks> blargh
12:23 <@matricks> Savander: edit all comments from // to /* */ comments
12:23 <@matricks> stupid C89
12:25 < Savander> okay!
12:27 < Savander> works, thanks ;)
12:38 < Savander> i pulled request with this small change
12:39 <@matricks> :)
12:50 < heinrich5991> Savander: have you tried compiling with something like -std=gnu99?
12:50 <@matricks> heinrich5991: doesn't matter, shouldn't have // comments
12:50 < heinrich5991> ok
12:50 < Savander> no heinrich5991 
12:51 < Savander> btw i download Github, and it looks nice. previously i used only console, but gui is really nice
12:55 < heinrich5991> ah nice :)
12:55 < heinrich5991> I found it a bit limiting tbh
12:56 <@minus> C89 is gay
12:57 <@matricks> minus: looks like msvc2015 is gonna have support for c99
12:57 < heinrich5991> and guess what they force us to write in university
13:05 < deen> heinrich5991: java?
13:05 < heinrich5991> C89
13:05 < heinrich5991> (at least in the lecture about compilers, because you know, you need to write in a low-level language to write a compiler. and you need to do it in a >25 year old version)
14:22 < Sadale> heinrich5991, that's dumb :(
14:22 < Sadale> Stupid microsoft. It lags in web in IE. It lags in compiler in msvc. It lags in everything :<
14:23 < Sadale> and it's essentially blocking the development of everything because its products is the last one to support something new. Yet, everyone are forced to use them because of their market dominance.
15:20 < JesseH> Is there any sort of contact between the client and server that happens periodically throughout the time connected?
15:21 < JesseH> With like, a minute in between
15:22 < JesseH> that would strain my computer and cause low fps* :P
15:22 < JesseH> Still trying to figure out this random low fps issue.
15:29 <@matricks> no
15:30 < JesseH> Doesn't seem to happen with any other game, either
15:45 < JesseH> Tried 0.6.2 and it's still doing it, so i dont think it's a problem with teeworlds
