12:41 < Fin>  HI, I got some err message while compiling Teeworlds, it sais bam has a syntax error:./bam.lua: Zeile 2: Syntaxfehler beim unerwarteten Wort `('
12:41 < Fin> ./bam.lua: Zeile 2: `target_family = os.getenv("TARGET_FAMILY")'
12:41 < Fin> I tried with the latest version, but how can I fix this?
12:41 < Fin> I am on linux mint 18 64b
12:47 <@heinrich5991> Fin: what version of teeworlds are you compiling? 0.6 0.7?
12:57 < Fin> DDNet 10.4.3
13:01 < Fin> so I guess it is based on the latest
13:02 < Ryozuki> ddnet = 0.6
13:03 <@heinrich5991> Fin: you can try to use cmake instead :)
13:03 < Fin> oh, ok, but what makes a difference for me?
13:03 < Fin> i never used cmake, what is it?
13:03 <@heinrich5991> do
13:03 <@heinrich5991> mkdir build
13:03 <@heinrich5991> cd build
13:03 <@heinrich5991> cmake ..
13:03 <@heinrich5991> make
13:03 < Fin> so i just use make every time?
13:04 <@heinrich5991> only make needs to be called on subsequent builds
13:04 <@heinrich5991> yes
13:05 < Fin> was ist subsequent?
13:05 <@heinrich5991> so for the first build you do what I said
13:06 <@heinrich5991> for all other builds, you only need to call "make" in the build directory
13:07 < Fin> ah I understand
13:08 < Fin> CMakeFiles/game-shared.dir/build.make:71: recipe for target '../src/game/generated/protocol.h' failed
13:08 < Fin> make[2]: *** [../src/game/generated/protocol.h] Error 2
13:08 < Fin> CMakeFiles/Makefile2:573: recipe for target 'CMakeFiles/game-shared.dir/all' failed
13:08 < Fin> make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/game-shared.dir/all] Error 2
13:08 < Fin> Makefile:83: recipe for target 'all' failed
13:08 < Fin> make: *** [all] Error 2
13:09 <@heinrich5991> can you give the output for cmake ..? preferably to some pastebin like https://pastebin.mozilla.org/
13:12 < Fin> https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8981744
13:14 <@heinrich5991> mh
13:14 <@heinrich5991> Fin: is there more output of 'make' than you posted?
13:14 <@heinrich5991> especially some more errors would be interesting
13:16 < Fin> http://pastebin.com/Bae5A6Gw ‚Üê make
13:17 <@heinrich5991> uh, sounds like a problem with the cmakelists.txt
13:17 <@heinrich5991> you can probably just 'mkdir ../src/game/generated' to work around it
13:20 < Fin> yap, worked, thanks
