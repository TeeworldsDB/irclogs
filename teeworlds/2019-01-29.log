09:52 < TeeSlayer> Does anybody know what the yellow names in the scoreboard signify?
09:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Spectating
10:29 < rand> spectating who ?
10:32 < TeeSlayer> I get this on my zcatch server
10:32 < TeeSlayer> initially I thought the yellow ones are the players I killed
10:32 < TeeSlayer> cus not everybody gets that color^^
12:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yellow should be only specs that are spectating you
13:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <1stDecadeTW> Couldn't that color be changed to purple instead of yellow? Purple is more familiar with spectators
15:50 <@Dune> so imageshack seems to edit images in a way that cannot be read by Teeworlds
15:50 <@Dune> @android272 had the same problem
15:50 <@Dune> @Fisico recommended me to use https://psydk.org/pngoptimizer and it fixed it (thanks! :)  )
15:50 <@Dune> I wonder what the problem is, though
15:51 <@Dune> `convert` is pretty useful to process all images in a script :(
16:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <android272> The script works mostly how I want it to. Some tweaking still needs to be done with the dimensions but it looks fine. TW is still not recognizing the json files that are created but I don't why. Unfortunately I don't know what imageMagick nor pngoptimizer is doing to fix that problem...
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @Dune probably a png format issue?
16:57 <@Dune> hm
16:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/formats/#png
16:57 <@Dune> I think it's lossless by default?
16:58 <@Dune> well I don't know much about that stuff :/
16:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> PNG:    Default. Save image using economical format.
17:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> PNG8 and PNG24 are common format, you should try it
17:04 <@Dune> trying to figure how to select them
17:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @Dune something like this? `convert test.png PNG8:test2.png`
17:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1468221/can-you-force-imagemagick-to-use-png-8-alpha-transparency
17:17 <@Dune> thanks :)
17:20 <@Dune> `for i in ./*; do convert $i -crop 64x64+0+0 PNG8:$i; done` :)
17:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> nice ðŸ˜ƒ
18:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> N
18:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> woops missclick -.-
21:29 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed pull request #2002: check if whisper message has a valid target (master...fix_whisper) https://git.io/fh6Nv
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <android272> Damn it! Neither PNG8 nor PNG24 helped.
22:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <android272> oddly PNG8 made Tees white squares, and PNG24 made them black squares.
