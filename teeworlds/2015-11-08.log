10:17 < Obani> I love that when someone tells me to contact him with the PMs on the forum
10:17 < Obani> And doesn't answer even when he is connected
10:20 < EastByte> I think the only notification is that the PM label is a bit bold

20:28 < Edible> yeah!
20:28 <@heinrich5991> oy commited fixed size of the ingame exist button (link)
20:28 <@heinrich5991> that would be fine already
20:29 < Edible> i just need to know how to printf bold italic normal and underline, and also an url shortener thats temporary and works like sprunge
20:29 < Edible> alright
20:30 <@heinrich5991> mirc colors are disabled for this channel
20:30 <@heinrich5991> so you can't print bold/italic/underlined/colored in here
20:31 < Edible> ahh, alright.
20:35 < Edible> alright, fixed i hope
20:41 < BotScratcher> oy committed fixed size of the ingame exit button ( https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/9f1d91e57309c78a623814ce6dfaf87e2a6c3e93 )

20:42 <@minus> shorten the hash, Edible
20:42 <@minus> to something like 7 chars
20:42 < Oy> always highlights me :(
20:42 <@minus> :D
20:42 <@heinrich5991> you could add a zero-width space into the name :D
20:42 <@minus> yeah, should probably add a zero width space in the name
20:43 <@minus> \u200b, you're welcome
20:43 <@heinrich5991> o​y
20:43 <@heinrich5991> Oy: does the above line highlight you?
20:44 < Edible> oh! ill use mimic!
20:44 <@heinrich5991> ?
20:45 < Oy> no
20:45 <@heinrich5991> Edible: so go ahead and use the zero-width space :)
20:46 <@minus> E​dible: do it
20:46 < Edible> this is mimic https://github.com/reinderien/mimic
20:47 <@heinrich5991> ah, I saw that somewhen :D
20:52 <@heinrich5991> a few links further:
20:52 <@heinrich5991> One admin was discussing the deletion of the main page in IRC and asked if the technical ability to delete pages with over 5,000 revisions, like the main page, had ever been re-enabled. Another admin (jokingly) commented that he had tested it and found that the main page still couldn't be deleted. The first admin thought he would test it for himself. The main page got deleted.[1][a]
20:52 <@heinrich5991> (wikipedia)
20:53 < Edible> printf "\u200edible"
20:53 < Edible> printf: missing hexadecimal number in escape
20:53 < Edible> mmm?
20:53 < Edible> i dont know stuff
20:53 <@heinrich5991> Edible: which language is this? bash?
20:54 < Edible> its shellscript and awk
20:54 <@heinrich5991> printf 'e\u200bdible\n'
20:54 <@heinrich5991> try this
20:55 < Edible> e\u200Bdible
20:55 < Edible> ?
20:56 < BotScratcher> oy committed fixed problem with mousewheel binds ( https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/bad57e24ec24b5343adc64fb1e9b95d72fed886d )
20:56 < BotScratcher> oy committed fixed missing handling for mouse keys ( https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/5bef0bcb8f72ed335b26e2ff0747b8d58e73b129 )
20:57 < Oy> again, shouldn't commit anymore
20:57 < Edible> killed it till its fixed
20:57 < Edible> sorry oy
20:58 < Edible> you can just /ignore BotScratcher
21:01 < Edible> doesnt work heinrich
21:03 <@heinrich5991> what doesn't work?
21:03 < Edible> what you said i should try
21:04 <@heinrich5991> can you paste the output of printf 'e\u200bdible\n' | hexdump -C 
21:04 <@heinrich5991> please?
21:07 < rand> http://ix.io/m1s
21:08 < Edible> output: http://sprunge.us/UHRW   code of commits http://sprunge.us/WGbS
21:08 <@heinrich5991> ok, so your printf doesn't seem to interpret \u
21:09 <@heinrich5991> Edible: can you try the same with /usr/bin/printf instead of just printf?
21:12 < Edible> same, but man printf does show \u, maybe its $lang's fault
21:15 < Edible> this is bizarre, want access ?
21:15 <@heinrich5991> sure (?)
21:22 < Oy> seems this thread https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11639 took a minor detour
21:24 < koomi> zero-width space breaks a bunch of irc clients
21:26 <@heinrich5991> koomi: in what way? :)
21:26 <@matricks> Oy: omg
