00:25 < heinrich5991> fisted: if you aren't allowed to rework the UI you're kind of locked with the current one
00:28 < fisted> reworking a UI should be only done when necessary, though.  not `just because', not to dumb it down (which is what `UI rework' typically means), and particularly not every so many weeks
00:29 < heinrich5991> I refuse to discuss on that premise
00:30 < fisted> eh?  you're free to state your own idea of when and why UI rework should and should not be done
00:30 < fisted> (it's kind of how discussions work)
00:32  * fisted shrugs
03:37 < BotoX> GUISE
03:38 < BotoX> PALE MOON IS AWESOME
04:33 < Inedible> BotoX, why?
04:33 < Inedible> and what did you use before?
04:34 < BotoX> Firefox 28.0
04:34 < Inedible> did you try cyberfox?
04:34 < Inedible> i found it the other day
04:34 < Inedible> but i'm too comfortable in pale moon
04:35 < Inedible> cyberfox supports 64b
04:35 < BotoX> eh
04:35 < BotoX> on linux
04:35 < Inedible> so... 64b advantages!
04:35 < Inedible> i think so
04:37 < Inedible> yeah, its open source, so look in your pkg manager i guess
04:37 < BotoX> pale moon is fine :ยง
04:43 < Inedible> but but but
04:43 < Inedible> 64b!
04:43 < Inedible> :(
04:43 < Inedible> pale moon has support as well, but dont use it
09:40 < EastByte> well, I just keep using firefox and chromium
10:22 <@minus> the fuck is pale moon
11:42 < koomi> hm, they are thinking about making bindings mutable by default in rust
11:42 <@matricks> koomi: I know
11:42  * matricks is fiddling with rust now
11:43 < koomi> just saw you in #rust :)
11:46 <@matricks> trying to make something small
11:50 < heinrich5991> koomi: I wonder whetehr that will bring good to the language
11:51 <@matricks> it's a small part of a larger issue
11:51 <@matricks> and nothing is decided, they are thinking about optison
11:51 <@matricks> options
11:52 < koomi> their intentions (simplicity mainly) seem noble enough
14:33 <@minus> i wonder if it's time to move away from python
14:33 <@minus> i miss static typing
14:38 < heinrich5991> static typing has its advantages
14:38 < heinrich5991> but when you have to do a quick hack, python is great :)
14:43 <@minus> but if you do something bigger it becomes a problem
14:44 <@minus> you can hack something not too bad with annotations and decorators though
14:44 <@minus> but that's run-time checks too

14:44 < BotoX> please kill me
14:44 < BotoX> random indents and suuuuuuper wide icons
