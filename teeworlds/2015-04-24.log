06:44 <@minus> eeeee: i meant more like offering a software you can run alongside your server, no public proxies, but per server instead
06:47 <@minus> matricks: i haven't seen anyone say that eeeee's web port is playable (though neither have i seen the opposite statement)
16:38 < Safa_[A_boy]> So, You'll release a new version, When is that?
16:39 <@minus> when it's done *ducks and runs*
16:40 < Safa_[A_boy]> So I can update the Arabic translation right?
16:51 < heinrich5991> minus: it's playable, I played a race map on it
16:51 < heinrich5991> Safa_[A_boy]: we still don't support RTL :(
16:51 < heinrich5991> and I can't give you an ETA on this
16:52 < Safa_[A_boy]> I'll do the pre-ordering stuff
16:52 < Safa_[A_boy]> passing the text to fribidi and getting it back
16:52 < Safa_[A_boy]> Btw, I edited the code so that the text I type goes to fribidi
16:53 < Safa_[A_boy]> (Chating I mean)
17:09 < heinrich5991> Safa_[A_boy]: so to answer your question, yes, you can update the arabic translation
17:11 < Safa_[A_boy]_> Great
19:16 < Safa_[A_boy]_> I think it's better not to add an Arabic translation until RTL got supported
19:17 < Safa_[A_boy]_> Have a nice day! :)
