00:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> He doesn't have logs afaik

00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> who is stealing my mod again

00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> like wtf
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> even the same map
00:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> seems like he banned me after i tried to get his skype or discord
00:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> great
00:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> license terms violation lol. using other people's work without crediting.
00:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> interesting reference when googling "lulzsec"
02:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> clan, players and server are only a few hours old, not even a day. france based. hosted on OVH. reminds me of jason54.
04:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> He spoke russian only but it looks like jason, yes. As he also was online on my server a few days ago
04:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But maybe it was also someone else... Idk man, its just sad to see this, alot of work from my side and he changes credits everywhere and also the mod name, just like jason did
09:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> oldest trick in the book: copying somebodys success and trying to get a bit out of it
09:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> if you keep your mod up to date and further improve it you will still land on top
09:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Sue him, the license doesnt allow non attribution
10:15 < ChillerDragon> oh thats why ddnet gives so much credits and appreciation to the upstream? :D
11:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Teeworlds licence doesn't require "appreciation"
12:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I thought the zlib license did require attribution, buuut It has a "misrepresentation of origin" clause there which would apply here
13:50 < ChillerDragon> is teeworlds even zlib?
13:51 < ChillerDragon> tbh idk what "origin of this software must not be misrepresented" actually means
14:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Yeah, not terribly clear
14:39 < day> fokkonaut, maybe add some weaknesses to your mods so you can dos them to death :P
14:42 < day> i wonder if you would even have to make the mods src public to comply with the license, as hosting something isnt really distribution of software
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FruchtiHD> > fokkonaut, maybe add some weaknesses to your mods so you can dos them to death :P
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FruchtiHD> @[quakenet] day#0000 He already did that by implementing 0.6 support.
14:44 < day> xD
15:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> interesting point, hosting not being distribution
15:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/urhg/__13.html
15:11 < day> jxs113 i did some more digging, it is definitely a loophole thats why the agpl exists
15:11 < day> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License
15:12 < day> that being said, tw doesnt seem to be GPL so all i wrote is more or less inapplicable
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> well zlib says `you must not claim that you wrote the original software. If you use this software in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be appreciated but is not required.`
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> so he must not claim that he wrote the mod/all of the mod, but if you want credits go for another license...
15:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> my posted link refers to german law, which applies to the part of the software that was written by fokko. It states that the creator/copyright owner has the right to keep the credits (analogy to a painter writing his name on his painting) as well as to have it shown if they want it to be shown. contrary to american copyright law, this right cannot be sold or passed on to another person. anyone owning the "painting"/software is also a
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the creator/painter may differ from the person owning the software/painting
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> german copyright law is odd
15:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if there never were credits, the creator would not be able to enforce this, but can always say that something was his creation (for example ghost writers of celebrity biographies could always say that they wrote this biography(but they never would, as nobody would hire them anymore)).
17:48 < ChillerDragon> lol @FruchtiHD
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @redix he can only use another license if it's compatible with the teeworlds license, since the mod is based apon it
18:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> other poeple: "sombody copied my mod and my server, i will sue them" me: "yay, somebody likes my stuff and wants to use it ❤️ "
19:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's not the point, from my perspective. well, having the same servers is to expected if one does make a mod open source. the point is more about renaming the mod, replacing the original creator's credentials with one's own nickname and giving a shit about the ton of work that was put into creating this modification. those usual licenses are as open as possible, while requiring the least of someone that wants to use the source code
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> when modifying a mod, credit should be given to those that were there before you and then add, not replace, your nickname/name
19:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
19:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> thanks man
