15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Hey, I have two questions:
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 1. Why does my rainbow get faster with increasing server uptime (higher tick value)?
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 2. If I shoot in /pause, so i can spec another player, and then resume the gun shoot will come. Why? It shouldnt save the input, but it somehow does
20:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @ChillerDragon if you use cmake you need to change the include files there, too
