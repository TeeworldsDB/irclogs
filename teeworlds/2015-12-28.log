02:26 <@minus> heinrich5991: advent of code day 19 part 2: i got lucky when i ran it on another machine and got a solution right away. and it just happened to be the shortest one.
07:46 < gwerben> hey
07:48 < gwerben> yesterday i implemented a dirty solution to use OTP (one time passwords) as rcon auth.
07:52 < gwerben> the problem is: i cnat send OTP with an unmodded client becuase the official one does only allow 32 chars passwords.
07:54 < gwerben> please apply this diff: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/14239364/
13:34 <@heinrich5991> 32 chars should suffice
19:58 < eeeee> s/suffice/be enough for anybody
20:09 <@minus> :D
