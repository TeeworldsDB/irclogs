11:58 < Oy> hey
11:59 <@Dune> hey
12:01 < Sonix-> hi
12:03 < Oy> Sonix-: think we can add the jungle unhookables
12:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> hi
12:17 <@Dune> I think PR 1580 (as well as 1589) is ready/waiting for comments btw
12:18 < Sonix-> Oy: dunno if landil meant to extend it on jungle unhookables 
12:19 < Oy> no idea :)
12:27 <@Dune> should bots not be displayed in the server browser?
12:28 <@Dune> to get 0.6 behavior
12:28 <@Dune> https://i.imgur.com/ulkSoAg.png
12:29 < Oy> think it's ok to show them, people can disable them if they want
12:29 <@Dune> they can?
12:30 <@Dune> I think showing them by default makes bot servers more attractive
12:30 < Oy> yeah, server filter -> don't show bots
12:30 <@Dune> ah alright, didn't see, thanks :)
12:30 <@Dune> guess it's very visible
12:31 <@Dune> gametype icons look awful on my resolution :(
12:31 <@Dune> http://puu.sh/CaD9o/28def80c08.jpg
12:32 < Oy> yeah, too big, too many details
12:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Fisico lts vote doesn't work on your server
12:32 <@Dune> I meant too pixelated
12:32 < Oy> blurry?
12:33 <@Dune> yeah
12:33 <@Dune> difficulty icons are much sharper
12:35 < Oy> well could make them sharper yeah - dunno if that looks better though :)
12:39 <@Dune> definitely would for the flags, they look very aliased :(
12:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> dune the serverconfig is fixed now
12:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> thanks
12:47 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpogE
12:47 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 0e65543 oy: use linear mapping for the gametype icons and fixed c&p error
12:48 <@Dune> I think it looks much better, thanks :)
12:49 <@Dune> https://puu.sh/CaDqi/48a28e3c54.jpg
12:49 <@Dune> the DM tee breaks the alignment, especially with LMS :|
12:52 < Oy> that's the image
12:52 <@Dune> yeah
12:52 <@Dune> not sure what could be done
12:53 < Oy> you mean that "DM" doesn't seem to align with "LMS" beneath?
13:01 < Oy> rand: u there?
13:01 < rand> o/
13:04 < Oy> added a note to the 64 player pull request
13:04 < Oy> do u have time?
13:04 < rand> I have
13:04 < rand> just see the note
13:05 < rand> I really feel like server annoucing more than 16 players are qualified as modded server
13:05 < rand> and then should only be flagged as impure
13:05 < rand> dropping them was relevant if the client could not handle in its interface more than 16 players
13:08 < Oy> no it's about that you're not allowed use standard gametypes for modified sources
13:08 < Oy> that's clearly the case here
13:08 < Oy> you can use anotehr gametype, then it's ok
13:08 < rand> ok, then that's not the correct test
13:08 < rand> and the commit I reverted was also wrong
13:09 < rand> I'll add dropping of ctf/dm... + maxplayer > 16 then
13:09 < rand> modder will call there server MaxCTF :3
13:10 < Oy> yeah
13:12 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/fpo2U
13:12 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master b8fcdf9 oy: fixed kill messages when a player leaves. closes #1744
13:12 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 6884cb6 oy: Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
13:12 < Oy> 1000 issues closed \o/
13:12 <@Dune> \o/
13:12 <@Dune> congrats
13:13 < Oy> so release day today? :)
13:13 <@Dune> hopefully :)
13:13 <@Dune> we depend on heinrich5991, don't we?
13:14 < Oy> i can fix the problem with the mac app - ain't pretty, but works
13:14 <@Dune> oh :o
13:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix when do you think you could write the map threads? how many are there, even?
13:17 <@Dune> Also I never touched steam, so not sure how to handle that (no rights either)
13:17 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpo2G
13:17 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master c6f0d19 oy: try to fix missing data dir for the mac app
13:19 < Oy> harcoded the data dir path for the mac app for now, dunno why the old way doesn't work anymore
13:20 < Oy> Dune: no idea about that steam stuff - heinrich5991 takes care of that ;)
13:23 <@Dune> alright
13:23 <@Dune> 0.7.2 should be a DLC :p
13:23 < Oy> :D
13:23 < rand> rebased and it should be ok
13:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I'll just put everything in one, whats the point making one for each map ðŸ˜› Dune
13:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I see, alright @Sonix. It's true we have a lot of them :)
13:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> there are still things that need to be fixed tho
13:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> ready_state system isnt working properly, countryflags look to small and should be swapped with score, K/D doesnt reset on restart
13:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> when i press R nothing happens
13:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> on first join a tee shouldnt be ready by default
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> and "game starts" thing should start only if tees are ready (if the ready_state is enable in srv)
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well if there are issues they should be mentioned/debated on github
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think the ready state works as it should (?)
13:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the score thing is a debate
13:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> and I think people joining being ready by default makes sense in most cases (?)
13:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> how does it work actually? just display a checkmark icon? lul
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> when you become unready, it would pause the server in clanwars
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> and only restart when everyone is, I think?
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> ppl should have time to warmup
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> before a real game
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> i think warmup should happen automatically, it's annoying already as it is
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> by warmup i mean play around
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> without game start activating each time u join in game
13:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> which is super annoying
13:37 < Oy> you can set warmup
13:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> those sound more like design discussions than bug fixes :/
13:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> the join still triggers game starts
13:38 < Oy> depends
13:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> depends if there's anyone ingame already or not
13:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> the other tee already in game must get annoyed too
13:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> when a random guy joins and triggers game starts
13:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> while u're trying to break flag capture time record (just an example)
13:40 < Oy> in 0.6 the game was already running
13:40 < Oy> hm
13:41 < Oy> will take a look at that
13:41 <@Dune> that's why I don't like warmups in general :pif need be I prefer to restart vote
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah that too
13:42 <@Dune> but to each their own ^^
13:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> for example the vote could be called only if all players are ready
13:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> else if the vote passes 3 are ready and the other guy is watching cat videos on youtube
13:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> sucks
13:43 <@Dune> ready states yeay
13:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> thats what ready state is for imo
13:56 <@Dune> thank you for your work rand :)

14:53 < Oy> Sonix when sv_player_ready_mode is set to 1 all players who join a game are not ready and the game just starts when they're ready
15:05 < Oy> some bot flag might be good for the server browser so you can identify them, when they aren't filtered?
15:06 <@Dune> yeah
15:06 <@Dune> probably should replace the country flag
15:06 <@Dune> (the flag makes no sense for bots)
15:10 < Oy> yeah

15:21 <@Dune> too late for easter
15:22 <@Dune> oh, "bots" is capitalized in the server browser filter

15:27 <@Dune> hmm
16:28 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy tagged 0.7-beta at master: https://git.io/fpoKv
16:29 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy deleted 0.7.0 at 8203cba: https://git.io/fpoKf
16:30 < Oy> so what about this issue https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1698 ?
16:42 <@Dune> you decide
16:43 <@Dune> as long as it's fixed, I don't mind
16:45 < Oy> i'd go with the simplest for now and do a possible bigger solution later
16:45 <@Dune> sounds good
16:45 < Oy> alright
17:13 < Oy> double esc is kinda odd
17:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> I made the post guys, tell me how does it look
17:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> in private forums ðŸ˜ƒ
17:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> @Sonix looks great dude
17:31 < Oy> Sonix that's great :)
17:32 <@Dune> looks good, thanks Sonix
17:34 <@Dune> yeah it's a bit odd, Oy
17:34 <@Dune> but when you think of it games tend to have two-layers menus, right
17:34 <@Dune> one for game actions, and one for settings
17:34 <@Dune> or just separate them
17:35 <@Dune> eh, I don't know. I just wish for a quick hotfix for now
17:35 < Oy> well i changed it and it feels odd...
17:36 <@Dune> I see :/
17:36 < Oy> dm3 second sentence, would change to "While many players have tested it during the tournaments it became a valid alternative to dm1..."
17:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Sonix
17:37 < Oy> well will try the buttons on top then
17:53 < Oy> https://imgur.com/a/EusR9o4 ?
17:55 <@Dune> too much alpha probably
17:56 <@Dune> I wouldn't have seprated it from the top bar
17:56 <@Dune> other tabs aren't, right
17:56 <@Dune> I'll go fetch stuff, brb
18:01 < Oy> these aren't subtabs, like in "call vote", "settings". attaching them to the tab would collide with the rest of the menu, break the design
18:01 < Oy> the alpha should be the same as the other menus
18:02 < Oy> pushed it so u can test
18:36 < rand> mall note about my server with bots, the bots leave if nobodies is connected (now)
18:37 < rand> connect at least one client if you want to see bots in the server browser view
18:39 < rand> (dunno if I should change that)
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> looks great Oy
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> busy till evening
19:08 < Oy> then we can probably close that issue
19:09 < Oy> could reduce the alpha a little bit, buttons got really dark
19:10 < Oy> compared to the ones in call vote menu
19:14 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpoMY
19:14 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master bce1eda oy: reduced alpha of the game menu and adjusted the record button
19:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> rand: I think it should be changed, server browser hides bot anyway with an option
19:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> So people who want to see bots can
19:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> fyi my server is uptodate now
19:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> you can connect with the latest version

20:40 <@Dune> gitk
20:42 <@Dune> for some reason submodules don't seem to be updated on my side :/
20:42 <@Dune> I don't have newer languages
20:43 <@Dune> e.g. esperanto
20:43  * ChillerDragon slaps heinrich5991 around a bit with a large fishbot
20:45 <@Dune> nvm, windows being weird
20:46 <@Dune> why are rand's bots not reported as clients though :/
20:47 <@Dune> they don't even belong to a team in CTF
20:47 < Oy> seems cliententer message is missing
20:48 <@Dune> so it's a server mod issue?
20:48 < Oy> on windows you can use sourcetree ;)
20:48 < Oy> guess so
20:48 <@Dune> oh
20:48 <@Dune> didn't know sourcetree, I do it all in the shell :c
20:48 < Oy> :P
20:49 < Oy> pretty handy
20:49 <@Dune> you mean, Alt+space,M,O to paste in the console isn't convenient? :P
20:50 < Oy> maybe :D
20:52 <@Dune> I like the new ingame menus :)
20:52 < Oy> good then i can close the issue :D

20:55 <@Dune> is the position of the flag with respect to the countryflag fine?
20:55 < Oy> ah should move that a bit
20:56 <@Dune> but gotta enlarge the scoreboard I guess
20:56 <@Dune> rand: http://puu.sh/CaNFH/411942861f.png
20:56 < Oy> yeah seems the cliententer message isn't there
20:57 < rand> hm
20:57 <@Dune> I shoot at people at random, not sure who's in my team :D
20:58 < rand> everything fine here

21:01 < rand> bots are using >16 ClientIDs
21:02 <@Dune> yeah they are
21:02 <@Dune> I got killed by 63:
21:02 < Oy> that's probably the problem
21:02 < rand> i have just did a bam -c bam
21:03 < rand> still no issue
21:03 <@Dune> ctf5 looks broken to me
21:03 < Oy> old map
21:03 < rand> there is a broken tree yes
21:03 < Oy> not the updated one
21:03 <@Dune> I see
21:03 < rand> probably wrong asset
21:04 < Oy> no map on the server is wrong
21:04 < Oy> had to download
21:04 < Oy> old one
21:04 < rand> i mean, the assets on the server
21:04 < rand> ah
21:04 < rand> yes, also
22:13 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] ChillerDragon opened pull request #1753: Add high dpi config for macOS (#1659) (master...pr_mac_4k) https://git.io/fpo5M
22:32 < Oy> Dune: seems sth wasn't properly updated on compile, after a forced recompile the not registered clients and change team problems seem to be gone
22:36 <@Dune> huh
22:36 <@Dune> so -f?
22:36 <@Dune> bam -f conf=debug?
22:43 < Oy> bam conf=debug -f
22:43 < Oy> yeah
22:57 <@Dune> oy
22:57 <@Dune> still can't see em
22:57 <@Dune> and spec is locked
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @LordSk does limit FPS need a restart?
23:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> nope
23:02 < rand> :|
23:04 < rand> Dune: wait
23:06 < rand> according to the hypothesis, you should have 14 bots with correct skins
23:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> rand: can you try joining my server?
23:11 < Oy> Dune: this is odd
23:11 <@Dune> yes rand i see those bots
23:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Oy, Dune, join my server
23:12 < rand> the file build/src/generated/protocol.cpp is not rebuild then
23:12 < Oy> Dune: can you do bam -c all
23:12 < Oy> and then build again
23:25 <@Dune> doing that
23:26 <@Dune> can we see the build timestamp of teeworlds somewhere ingame?
23:28 < Oy> no
23:28 <@Dune> aight
23:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> The whole code from the dummy test is here btw: https://github.com/LordSk/teeworlds/blob/develop/mod_dummies/src/game/server/gamemodes/mod.cpp
23:28 <@Dune> i don't see rand's server anymore
23:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Dune: join mine
23:28 <@Dune> aight
23:28 <@Dune> ok
23:28 <@Dune> I see many dummies
23:28 < rand> refresh, they are not dead :3
23:28 <@Dune> it's all good :)
23:29 <@Dune> it says full server rand
23:29 <@Dune> 64/64
23:29 <@Dune> but i still can join
23:29 <@Dune> works :)
23:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> sooo is bam working correctly then?
23:30 < rand> yep, you can always join the bot server as long as there are bots
23:30 <@Dune> probably? I think the issue is I forgot to launch the teeworlds from a different folder after switching release mode
23:31 <@Dune> that's why i didn't see it in my browser, I checked "no full server"
23:31 < rand> that's a flaw in my server design
23:32 < rand> the issue about the team change is triggerd when there are more players than m_PlayerSlots 
23:33 < rand> when leaving the team, the amounts of players stays to high, so the client denies it
23:38 < rand> but this should not occur
23:42 < Oy> there are more locale problems within the localisations
23:44 <@Dune> are there?
23:45 < Oy> yeah i make a list
23:45 <@Dune> cool
23:50 < Oy> https://pastebin.com/7bvD2NBw
23:50 < Oy> bosnian is a false positive
23:51 < rand> neat
23:52 < Oy> have to fix that false positive
23:53 < rand> there is the same with chinese
23:53 < rand> I guess you check each % instead of %xx
23:56 < Oy> yeah and then if the following char is the same
