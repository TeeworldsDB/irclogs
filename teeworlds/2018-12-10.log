20:23 < Oy> hey
20:25 <@Dune> hey
20:25 < Oy> anything new?
20:25 <@Dune> post&changelog ready
20:25 <@Dune> lots of issues reports, a few are bugs that should probably be fixed
20:26 <@Dune> I opened some PRs for all but the server info overlap
20:28 <@Dune> @Zatline and @LordSk were of big help for the announcement
20:28 < Oy> good
20:29 <@Dune> will the mac release be troublesome anyhow?
20:29 < minus> @-ing user names should have never become a thing
20:29 < minus> so what was this versionsrv stuff you wanted
20:30 < minus> and did i say i was gonna look at the docs stuff this week?
20:30 <@Dune> version stuff only after release
20:30 <@Dune> oh, that's cool since readme.md now links the docs stuff
20:31 < Oy> mac release shouldn't be a problem i think
20:31 <@Dune> cool
20:31 < Oy> version stuff - running the version server after release
20:31 <@Dune> it's not running at all right now?
20:32 < Oy> don't think so
20:32 < minus> it doesn't even have DNS record, does it
20:34 <@Dune> nope
20:34 <@Dune> yeah, well, discord :/ on one side, it doesn't mix so well, on the other, it helped a lot to reach to contributors who don't have the nerdiness to set up an IRC client/bouncer. it can always be made read-only again if it's deemed too much trouble. matricks disappeared, so idk
20:37 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/fpHxA
20:37 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master e25c28e Jordy Ruiz: Fix none theme not saving properly (default is selected at restart)
20:37 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 62dbf46 oy: Merge pull request #1836 from Dune-jr/fix-theme-saving...
20:39 < Oy> Dune: about the listbox thing - with that commit it wouldn't be clear which listbox has the input focus
20:39 <@Dune> yes, it wouldn't
20:40 <@Dune> any suggestion, though?
20:42 < Oy> would highlight the one that isn't active differently
20:42 <@Dune> hm
20:42 <@Dune> can just decrease the alpha
20:42 <@Dune> it's a one-liner
20:43 < Oy> probably the best for now
20:43 <@Dune> but then it might look weird the mouse leaves the box and it's still selected (even tho no click)
20:45 < Oy> yeah, should probably not make it active when moving  the mouse to it
20:46 <@Dune> so only on click, that might be trickier
20:51 < Oy> make ProcessInput a pointer https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1837/files#diff-cad6690c312d4ab80e91a046cdbb5becR959 - set it to true there and when the function return check if it's true and then change the active one
20:52 < minus> https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/blob/master/build.py#L22 what kind of drugs was i on when i wrote this particular line
20:54 < Oy> good ones :D
20:54 <@Dune> I had to scroll up to see what project this was from :D
20:57 <@Dune> I will take care of the processinput stuff after dinner
21:07 < Oy> ok
21:07 < Oy> any news from heinrich?
21:08 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpHjO
21:08 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 19e918d oy: fixed  overlapping name within ingame server info. closes #1832
21:12 <@Dune> nope :(
21:19 <@Dune> "My friend is getting this error when running teeworlds on Linux Mint 18 Cinnamon:
21:19 <@Dune> ./teeworlds./teeworlds: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.27' not found (required by ./teeworlds)"
21:19 <@Dune> @Slayer *gV* ran into this, and says it is 0.7 only
21:42 < Oy> ok :(
21:43 < Oy> seems he uses an older glibc version
21:43 < Oy> should probably build the release with some old versions
22:07 <@Dune> (inet crash)
22:07 <@Dune> > should probably build the release with some old versions
22:07 <@Dune> yeah :/
22:07 <@Dune> can you downgrade anyhow, Oy?
22:08 <@Dune> otherwise I can build it myself - I have 2.23
22:09 < Oy> yeah then you should build it
22:10 < Oy> or we find someone with a debian jessie f.e.
22:35 <@Dune> rand: we're done with testing, you can set normal settings on your server :p
22:40 < rand> ok,soon (1day)
22:56 < Teeworlds> [documentation] minus7 created build-refactor (+1 new commit): https://git.io/fpQLw
22:56 < Teeworlds> documentation/build-refactor 90c77b9 minus: Refactor build.py
22:58 < Teeworlds> [documentation] minus7 opened pull request #15: Refactor build.py (master...build-refactor) https://git.io/fpQL7
22:58 < minus> mind taking a quick look, Dune?
23:12 <@Dune> into, minus?
23:12 < minus> see above
23:12 <@Dune> ah, nvm
23:12 < minus> merging that *should* build the docs on teeworlds.com, too
23:13 < minus> just gotta see if it works and then put that stuff into the webroot
23:13 <@Dune> alright, then I'll merge
23:13 < Teeworlds> [documentation] Dune-jr closed pull request #15: Refactor build.py (master...build-refactor) https://git.io/fpQL7
23:14 < minus> with that change everyone with write access to the repo has remote code execution on teeworlds.com
23:14 <@Dune> huh, alright, that's to keep in mind
23:15 < minus> aaand of course i forgot adding the webhook before
23:15 <@Dune> don't you have write access on documentation?
23:15 < minus> i do
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> git submodule update
23:18 <@Dune> In my opinion, Support should link to the documentation directly instead of this https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=help
23:18 <@Dune> btw when the release is done, I believe the frontpage will have to be edited a bit too
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> woops wrong chat sry
23:27 <@Dune> didn't know you could catch root files with **/*.md
23:28 < Teeworlds> [documentation] minus7 pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpQYL
23:28 < Teeworlds> documentation/master 77c35cd minus: Remove empty readme
23:31 < minus> neither did i until i tried, Dune
23:32 < Dune_linux> It fails on     shutil.rmtree(args.target) for me
23:33 < Dune_linux> TypeError: lstat: illegal type for path parameter
23:35 <@Dune> not that it matters, everything seems to work fine locally
23:36 < minus> old python?
23:36 <@Dune> 3.5
23:37 < minus> old.
23:37 < minus> anyway it fails for another reason on 3.5 as well
23:37 <@Dune> I thought 3.4 would suffice
23:38 <@Dune> i haven't noticed any other issue
23:38 < minus> it's not like i tested that
23:38 < minus> i tested on 3.7
23:43 < Teeworlds> [documentation] minus7 pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpQO4
23:43 < Teeworlds> documentation/master 0c698b8 minus: Fix build.py for Python 3.5
23:44 <@Dune> the most common python interpreters are not written in python
23:44 <@Dune> huh
23:44 < minus> what
23:45 < minus> it's an interpreter, it can't be written in itself
23:45 <@Dune> i think pypy is
23:46 <@Dune> ah, nevermind, it says it's RPython
23:46 <@Dune> whatever that is
23:48 < minus> a subset of python
23:48 < minus> i think the docs now work
23:49 < minus> not sure because i didn't get any errors on first try
23:49 <@Dune> suspicious
23:49 < minus> made it error, did show an error
23:49 <@Dune> well yeah, they are updated
23:49 < minus> works as intended
23:50 < minus> maybe add this https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=help as index.md
23:50 <@Dune> would be cool
23:51 <@Dune> if I understood correctly, the script to update the frontpage is to ping you the changes request
23:52 < minus> oh, it's already anyway
23:52 < minus> that's help.md
23:55 <@Dune> oh
23:56 < Dune_linux> I'm not sure if it's built correctly, minus 
23:56 < Dune_linux> https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/blob/0c698b86f020ef6781938b5b130cbbab093f2305/build.py#L44
23:56 < Dune_linux> I think it is built there: https://teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=help
23:56 < Dune_linux> the real link, however, is https://teeworlds.com/?page=help
23:57 < Dune_linux> (but that might be an alias or something?)
23:57 < minus> yes
23:57 <@Dune> alright, cool :)
