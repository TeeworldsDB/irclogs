19:10 < matricks> minus: wroom wroom :D
19:20 < matricks> minus: complete build of teeworlds in 1.6s :D
19:20 < matricks> minus: my new machine is zippy :D
19:52 <@minus> 1.6s? that's insane
19:53 <@minus> oh, actually not that insane
19:53 <@minus> builds in 12s here
19:55 <@minus> a release build actually takes 23s :o
19:55 <@minus> so, what'd you get, matricks, and how old was your old machine
19:56 <@minus> and how do you still have money spare when paragliding is so expensive
19:56 <@minus> a colleague does that too and also complains about it being expensive
20:08 <@minus> so, what's the first thing you tried on that machine
20:08 <@minus> new order?
20:08 <@minus> i'd like to give UT4 a spin some time
20:09 < matricks> minus: don't have windows :)
20:09 < matricks> minus: tried to compile some rust stuff
20:09 <@minus> pff, get them to port it
20:09 < matricks> minus: and teeworlds
20:09 <@minus> well, teeworlds obviously was short-lived fun
20:09 < matricks> :D
20:09 < matricks> gonna do some video editing this year as well
20:09 < matricks> kinda why I got a new compy
20:10 < matricks> or.. well.. the excuse I used to buy a new compy
20:10 <@minus> =D
20:10 <@minus> what software do you use for video editing?
20:10 < matricks> kdenlive
20:10 <@minus> mh
20:12 <@minus> what else are you up to these days, anything interesting?
20:12 < matricks> not really, paragliding :)
20:12 < matricks> just back from austria
20:12 <@minus> me too!
20:13 < matricks> AUSTRIA HIGH FIVE! o/*\o
20:14 <@minus> i mean, i go to austria daily
20:14 <@minus> last week i was in vienna tho, on a conference. john romero gave a talk there
20:14 < matricks> oh
20:15 <@minus> historical talk about id, nothing technical
20:15 < matricks> oh, I've also order a new glider :D
20:18 < matricks> minus: oh! I got pictures! :D
20:19 <@minus> pc or glider?
20:19 < matricks> glidering in austria

20:21 < matricks> minus: that one and the next <3
20:21 <@minus> i have facebook blocked here D:

20:22 < matricks> one of the pictures
20:22 < matricks> bahh! low res
20:23 < matricks> http://flightlog.org/fl.html?rqtid=3&trip_id=523667&20170510171855
20:24 <@minus> where is that?
20:24 < matricks> Austria, Greifenburg, Drautal
20:24 <@minus> never heard of
20:24 < matricks> Lienz?
20:25 <@minus> that i have heard of, no idea where that is though
20:25 < matricks> hehe, griefenburg is in the same valley, drautal
20:25 < matricks> part of KÃ¤rnten
20:25 < matricks> well, lienz seems to be in tirol
23:23 < matricks> minus:  Timing O_DIRECT disk reads: 6608 MB in  3.00 seconds = 2202.35 MB/sec
23:23 < matricks> I like the disk speeds :D
23:23 <@minus> neat
23:23 <@minus> fastest i've achieved was ~900MB/s
23:24 <@minus> that was off of 6 5400rpm disks simultaneously. now they're in raidz2 and still give almost 400MB/s, so that's good too
23:24 <@minus> i guess that's gonna be good for video editing
23:24 < deen> matricks: yeah, m.2 is nice, but at those speeds throttles pretty quickly
23:25 <@minus> what do you mean?
23:25 < deen> You're talking about an m.2 SSD in your new computer, I assume
23:25 <@minus> if you bypass the kernel fs cache it shouldn't drop from that
23:26 < deen> and the m.2 SSDs usually have no cooler and start termal throttling after 1 min or something at full speed
23:26 < matricks> oh well, sleepy time
23:27 <@minus> interesting
23:27 <@minus> yes, me too
23:28 < deen> (but in 1 min you already read 120 GB, so the throttling doesn't matter for most workloads)
