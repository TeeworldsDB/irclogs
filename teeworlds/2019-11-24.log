20:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think specs shouldn't be network clipped
20:45 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> This way you can record nice demos as spec
22:48 < Learath2> How do 0.7 teleports work? Are they on their own layer? Are they limited in number like 0.5 era ddrace teleporters? Single input, single output?
22:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> what mod are you talking about?
22:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @redix
22:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> 0.7 doesn't have teles out of the box
22:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> (yet)
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> uh oh
22:49 < Learath2> Oh did you never end up merging in race?
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no AFAIK
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> race was deemed to be alive and well working on its own at the time
22:49 < Learath2> is there a candidate race mod?
22:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> candidate = candidate for inclusion in vanilla?
22:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> or = race mod for 0.7?
22:54 < Learath2> I meant it as the first one, but judging from your response, I'm guessing nothing is there yet, so the second one is also fine :D
22:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/axblk/teeworlds/tree/race (?)
22:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I think this is @redix's race mode
22:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Dune is that correct?
22:56 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> yes
22:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Learath2: the race mod that would make it in teeworlds would be lighter in features than what you'd usually make, and in 0.6 they decided that there is little point in making one because it couldn't compete with teerace anyway
22:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> However there are some efforts for client-side integration which @redix is leading
22:57 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> He's also open for suggestions for features that one would want in there, he wrote a message about that a while ago
22:58 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> http://puu.sh/EIh08/618765156b.png
22:59 < Learath2> Hmm, he doesn't seem to have an extra layer for teleporters, I wonder where he is storing the data for them
22:59 < Learath2> redix: here?
22:59 < Learath2> Oh, nvm he does have an extra layer
22:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> you could open a 0.7 race map to understand how it works
23:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune>

23:00 < Learath2> I'm doing a rewrite of ddnet for 0.7. Was just looking around to make sure I don't end up too far incompatible with a race mod if there is one that's prevalent
23:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> That's cool!
23:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> There is a map converter tool that does 0.6->0.7 for tilesets and teleport layers
23:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> it doesn't handle ddnet stuff but it might be a good starting point
23:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/axblk/teeworlds/issues/34 (redix wrote it)
23:02 < Learath2> There is already a direct port of ddnet that fokkonaut made and I think deen made a converter that sorta works for it. But I decided to go for a clean rewrite with the version bump. DDNet is quite a lot of spaghetti code anyway
23:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's cool, do hit up redix with ideas for client side integration if you have any, and chances are it could make it in the game before the end of the year
23:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I'm not sure if the client-side integration will recognize teleports anyhow though
23:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> does the ddnet client do anything with the teleport info from the game layer?
23:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it unfortunately can't because ddnet teleporters are random
23:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if there's more than one OUT teleporter
23:06 < Learath2> (we never came up with a good way to predict that)
23:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> with proper integration, it should be predictable by the client, so maybe drop the randomness for race there
23:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> is that a feature or something you want to drop?
23:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> people would probably call it a feature in 0.6
23:07 < Learath2> I did come up with an idea though, maybe we can feed clients the possible out positions when they are close to a teleporter and use the teleporters number to predict where we are headed
23:08 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> people called a bug a feature, where the grenade would explode twice if it hit the wall the moment it timed out
23:09 < Learath2> @heinrich5991 is it actually random, I don't quite remember the semantics, It might have been actually checking around the out tile to see which one is emptier
23:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't know Learath2's plans for ddnet 0.7
23:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no, it's rand_int()%num_teles
23:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's spawning you're thinking about
23:09 < Learath2> Oh really?
23:09 < Learath2> Why don't we just seed it then?
23:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, pretty sure
23:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> we can do that
23:09 < Learath2> why did we decide against that?
23:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no implementation yet
23:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> need to find a way to satisfy players so that no ranks are invalidated
23:10 < Learath2> Okay, that's what I might go for then
23:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> nice
23:10 < Learath2> After I finish up teams though, turns out deep copying CGameWorlds, not that easy :P
