01:40 <@heinrich5991> two servers with permanent client-side bots
01:40 <@heinrich5991> I'm in favor of banning them from the server list
01:41 <@heinrich5991> based on the "only show real players" and "vanilla gametypes should be vanilla" paradigm
01:41 <@heinrich5991> (checked both servers, they do indeed contain the bots)
16:57 <+rand> second is mine
17:20 <@heinrich5991> minus: see above
17:20 <+rand> not that i can argue against this too rules, the server has been online for two years, in server list, announcing that the server contains one bot in server name and server description
17:21 <+rand> the first server seems to do the same thing.
17:23 <@heinrich5991> since you're in the channel, we can just ask you to take it offline if we want to take action (instead of banning)
17:28 <+rand> then, i'll just hope players that like the bot has set the server in there favorite list ^^
17:31 <+rand> i set sv_register to 0, it should disappear from server list on next hearthbeat
17:36 <+rand> (note that the matter has been discussed here and on the forum and no action was taken at the time)
17:37 <+rand> (but i dont like hook bot, soâ€¦ i really can't argue for the servers to stay in server list :V )
