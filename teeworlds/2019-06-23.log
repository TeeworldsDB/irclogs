13:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> download big map -> abort midway -> try to reconnect to the same server -> client crashes
13:55 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> city map
14:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Interesting I think I did have the same issue but I didn’t know how to reproduce. I wonder if this was a problem in 0.6
14:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @jxsl13 I remember this issue a while ago, I thought it was fixed. version?
14:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> yeah happens to me too
14:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> latest version
15:04 < Dune> from what I remember, I could only reproduce on windows release version
15:04 < Dune> I'm trying to reproduce on linux, can't :/
15:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> eah, it's on windows
15:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah
16:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 0.7.3.1
16:54 < minus> 0.7.3.1.1
17:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <＃6909> What makes maps take so long to download if they re just some kb?
17:14 < Dune> the protocol
17:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <＃6909> Cant remove that?
17:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Sonix> some custom maps arent just some kbs
17:15 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <＃6909> Most maps i played are just less than 600kb
17:26 < Dune> the protocol is how the download happens, you can't "remove" a protocol
17:26 < Dune> you can improve it
17:26 < Dune> I don't know what are the constraints but I think some of the DDoS reflection nasty 0.6 stuff exploits map downloads
20:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> the server sends a lot of data with a map download
20:13 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> so it could probably kill itself with the wrong protocol and too much downloading clients
22:14 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> zcatch servers are super laggy, pls stop porn downloads
