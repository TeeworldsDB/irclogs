18:57 < ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 how is eval_if_cmd affecting gameplay?
19:01 < ChillerDragon> oh ok in ddnet makes more sense
19:43 < scootergrisen> Are there some way translators can be information about string freezes before a stable release?
19:43 < scootergrisen> So that i can make sure it if fully translated
19:44 < scootergrisen> On transifex it is 100% translated now but that is master so perhaps there will be changes between now and next stable release
19:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> usually there will be a announcement made in discord before a new release to let translators know the string on transifex is updated.
19:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> not sure about IRC since I wasn't paying attention here before.
19:50 < scootergrisen> Are there other ways then discord?
19:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> Probably. Dune would probably tell you when he sees this
19:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Dune
19:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> idk tbh
19:52 < scootergrisen> Also i don't understand the credits for the translations in the json file. How are people added and where is it used in the game?
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there are announcements on transifex and tw.com
19:53 < scootergrisen> Ok. Do you mean tw.com or teeworlds.com? tw.com not loading
19:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> teeworlds.com
20:03 < scootergrisen> Is the re_convert.py file suppose to take my name from the po file and put it in the json file?
20:22 < scootergrisen> How can i see the string "Net score" in the game?
20:23 < scootergrisen> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/dc1802c20270679f112fef86e37e0831c8fe2104/src/game/client/components/stats.cpp#L228
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you need to open the advanced scoreboard I think
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it counts your kills minus your deaths
20:29 < minus> hi
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hi. oops ðŸ˜„
20:30 < minus> ^^
20:32 < scootergrisen> I can enable things in Controls but i just see "Net" not "Net score"
20:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ohh
20:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm. you're getting asked to translate "Net score"?
20:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in the link you pasted, it looks like a context string
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it's used to distinguish "Net" from other possible "Net" strings that might appear in different contexts
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> for example the english word "Play" in the main menu, and the "Play" button in the demo menu needed different translations for german
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> "Spielen", "Abspielen"
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's where this context string comes in
20:36 < scootergrisen> Is "Net score" not used in the game?
20:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> correct
20:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> or let me check
20:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
20:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah, it is used
20:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> let me find the context
20:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in settings -> statboard -> configure statboard
20:45 < scootergrisen> He. I already looked there but i guess i got confused with english/danish and current/privious translation
20:45 < scootergrisen> Maybe it should both should the actual text used during a game like "Net" and then the explanation after
20:46 < scootergrisen> Like "Net (Net score)" or something like that
20:53 < scootergrisen> I find it hard to translate "Net"
20:53 < scootergrisen> Seems like some languages have used "Total" which seems to me to be wrong
20:54 < scootergrisen> Some have used a word like "Difference"
20:55 < scootergrisen> Maybe better that "Net score" was a longer text to explain it
20:56 < scootergrisen> I guess that is the point of "Net score" to explain the shorter "Net" string
20:56 < scootergrisen> Is it possible to zoom the map?
20:57 < scootergrisen> Like maybe i could watch the entire map on the screen at the same time
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no, it's not possible to zoom the map
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there might be custom clients that allow doing that in spectator mode, idk
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there were some in the 0.6 version of the game
20:58 < ChillerDragon> ZillyWoods and F-Client yes
21:01 < scootergrisen> Would it be better to call "Net" "Difference" or "Diff"?
21:02 < scootergrisen> And "Net score" something like "Difference in frags and death scores"
21:05 < scootergrisen> So the strings are explaing the short strings
21:06 < scootergrisen> "Ratio" could be a long description like "Ratio between ... and ..."
21:06 < scootergrisen> Otherwise how could people know what ratio is?
21:08 < scootergrisen> I think all the strings below "Configure statboard" should be a long description
21:16 < scootergrisen> What is "tee"?
21:20 < scootergrisen> Does it have anything to do with tee in golf?
21:32 < ChillerDragon> golf? xd scootergrisen did you ever play the game? (i do not mean to be rude but sounds like you translate a game you do not know)
21:32 < ChillerDragon> the players are called tees so your character is a tee
21:33 < scootergrisen> i played it like a week
21:33 < scootergrisen> But what does tee mean?
21:34 < ChillerDragon> i never asked myself that i just assumed its the name of the creature
21:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It's a shirtless t-shirt
21:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> scootergrisen: nothing really
21:41 < ChillerDragon> its german tea
21:46 < scootergrisen> why can't they live in peace?
21:53 < scootergrisen> and why are the hands only on one side of the body?
21:53 < scootergrisen> hehe
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> You typically don't run with both hands on the same side
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> unless you are doing some sort of horizontal naruto running
22:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> dab-running
22:30 < scootergrisen> Somethings wrong with the tee. They are able to hold the hook with one hand and then keep turning the other hand around on the inside
22:30 < scootergrisen> that seems not biological possible
22:31 < scootergrisen> are they robots?
23:00 < scootergrisen> Ok i will go. See you all. Bye bye
23:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> see you ðŸ˜‰
