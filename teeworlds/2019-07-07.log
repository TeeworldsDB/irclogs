18:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> What do you guys think of more size options for consoles? The local and remote client console is always half screen. Maybe something similar to the envelopes would be nice.
19:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Any idea on how that should exactly work? @jao suggested pressing ctrl+console ping to expand it in smaller steps until fullscreen but im not sure how that works well with compose binds
19:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think that's the kind of feature that like three people will ever know of and use
19:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> The difficult part about this is probably making a nice UI
19:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> UX u mea?
19:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the UI doesnt change
19:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> same console design yust different size
19:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I would prefer a monospaced font over anything else for rcon
19:10 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh ye that is nice
19:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> But for example as admin when i suspect a teamhooker on my public server i type kick command already and then keep watching the suspect. But half view is blocked by console.
19:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is it not kept there if you press f2 to toggle rcon? to watch and toggle again?
19:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the command
19:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> find it annoying tho if its a mix between reating super fast and watching an undefined time
19:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> it sounds like you're having a very specific problem though, would this apply to others?
19:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes all types of admins i also have this issue while moderating ddrace servers
19:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but i guess in most cases the console is pretty fine
19:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Many people open it to read through long chats where a fullscreen could come in handy
21:29 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does anyone know, what the broadcast time is, a message is displayed in the client?
21:35 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <WsY[FU]?> You should ban more people to become faster at this, dragon
21:36 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <WsY[FU]?> What would be cool is scrolling one line at a time instead of a whole page
23:04 <@heinrich5991> minus: I found your PR in a random discussion involving wayland: https://github.com/jonls/redshift/pull/663 :D
