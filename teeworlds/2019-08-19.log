01:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> getting a namespace conflict on windows with IStorage, ... https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/objidl/nn-objidl-istorage
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Could we maybe render the Ready tick in the scoreboard also if we are not in one of the 3 needed states? This could be used to show wich players are authed or confirmed or logged in on mods
19:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Could we remove the info to not logged in players entirely? I don't want that other people see my admin rights (except other admins)
19:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I think its a cool feature :)
19:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> are you even admin on vanilla servers Assa?
19:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> where is that shown, that someone is logged in as admin Oo? other than not being votable or something like that?
20:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <WsY[FU]?> playerflag
20:11 < bridge> [freenode] <Digit> any tips on overcoming a teeworlds addiction?
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> buy a new mouse
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> thats how i over came it
20:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i stopped playing completly since i wasnt able to control my tee anymore
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> harder drugs are a solution.
20:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it seems like the new survival (random) spawning behaves not so well, I was told that people spawn at the same location or really close to each other.
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> might be intended? dunno.
20:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @WsY[FU]?  how can one see that?
20:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <WsY[FU]?> modified client (i.g gamer)
20:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok, thx.
20:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> didn't know, I'm on vanilla ðŸ˜„
20:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think the server is telling players too much about moderation staff in general. people see, who watches them, could be used by ppl to trigger bots according to whether they are being watched by someone or a certain someone. it makes admin work harder.
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <WsY[FU]?> depends on the gamemode ig
20:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <WsY[FU]?> fix is a one liner, and since players won't notice a difference, it's fine to have it on vani server (u can always pretend u are using econ) :^)
20:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> also seeing, whether an admin is watching you with those flags seems to be a possibility
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> U can't kick em :)
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Oy, clients on my server are getting kicked for Error sending data, and or out of buffer when i activate rainbow for everyone. I guess it cant handle all the skinchanges?
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> or if i connect like 30 or 40 bots at the same time
21:02 < Oy> yeah probably overlads the recv buffer
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> So sad :(
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Can I increase the limit? :D
21:06 < Oy> no
21:06 < Oy> buffer it and then send parts with delay
21:06 < Oy> similar to map/rcon list in the server engine
21:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But rainbow needs to be instant
22:06 < Dune_> since 0.7.3.1: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/compare/0.7.3...master
22:16 < Oy> lots of stuff
22:18 < Dune_> lots of small stuff :p
22:19 < Oy> :P
23:09 < JesseH> Does anyone know how to get in touch with Broken?
