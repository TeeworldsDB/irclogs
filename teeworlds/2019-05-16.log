21:13 < rand> sometimes, the scoreboard stay lock when I press the key for ~2/3s
21:13 < rand> (holding the key longer don't trigger this (it didn't occur))
21:14 < rand> tI don't remember this as a feature, am I wrong ?
21:16 < rand> *it occors for some longer press
21:16 < rand> (definitely not contiguous)
