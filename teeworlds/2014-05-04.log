06:03 < siavashserver> hi
06:04 < siavashserver> When I connect to a new server, game runs fine for a couple of minutes (10min+)
06:05 < siavashserver> After that I get disconnected, and whenever I try to reconnect, I get disconnected after about 10 seconds
06:06 < siavashserver> Any ideas what can be wrong?
06:07 < siavashserver> Oh
06:07 < siavashserver> And I'm using v0.6.2 on archlinux
11:55 < ghost91> oi
12:13 <@minus> io
12:48 < BotoX> https://botox.bz/0x40/ muh UI
14:33 <@minus> i dun see no ui
15:05 < BotoX> Press F5 idk
15:55 <@minus> you don't seem to know what i mean
16:42 < lawr0000> Is 0.7 never coming?
16:42 < ghost91> it probably will come some day
16:44 < Edible> it demands a sacrifice, give yourself to cthulhu
16:44 < lawr0000> Teeworlds is dead
16:44 < lawr0000> someone needs to take over
16:47 < koomi> nah, teeworlds is perfect, there is nothing to add
16:48 < lawr0000> not enough players or attention
16:49 < lawr0000> it is just a small inactive project
16:51 < lawr0000> there's only 1000 players at one time
16:53 < EastByte> there always have been iirc
17:11 <@minus> "only"
17:11 <@minus> 1000 is a lot
17:12 <@minus> around ten times of what Soldat has left. they had 1000 players too not too long ago though
17:15 < heinrich5991> lawr0000: 1000 players is a lot actually
17:17 < lawr0000> I suppose it is okay, but when do we have a new update?
17:19 < lawr0000> like 0.7 hasn't been worked on for over half a year?
17:33 < heinrich5991> lawr0000: yes, lately the development didn't move in the fastest pace
17:33 < heinrich5991> however, there were other such precedences
17:51 < ghost91> lawr0000: actually there has been going on a lot in the last half year
17:51 < ghost91> it’s just that lot’s of things have not been merged into the main repo yet
17:52 < ghost91> however, I understand your point
17:52 < ghost91> and as heinrich5991 said, at the moment, there’s not too much happening
17:52 < ghost91> that might be caused by the fact, that the main developer (Oy) is not very active atm
17:52 < ghost91> and for this reason, not much gets merged
17:53 < ghost91> i also talked to matricks about this recently, and about the idea to give more people push access the the main repo
17:53 < ghost91> i don’t know what his thoughts about this are right now though
17:56 < lawr0000> Teeworlds should find a new head developer?
18:01  * lawr0000 slaps Kottizen around a bit with a large fishbot
18:02 < lawr0000> Anyone want a quicky 1on1?
18:03 < EastByte> I want
18:03 < ghost91> lawr0000: well, it’s not that easy to find somebody who has enogh time, knowlege and desire to do this job
18:03 < ghost91> it’s quite time consuimg and you need to know a lot about teeworlds
18:03 < lawr0000> EastByte: ok
18:04 < lawr0000> idk?
