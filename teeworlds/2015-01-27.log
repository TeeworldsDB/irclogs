05:08 < JulianAssange> is there ever any reason there would be ';;' at the end of a statement?
05:09 < JulianAssange> function();;, vs function();
11:17 <@minus> typo i'd say, as ; are just separators on C++ and do not do anything
15:44 < BotoX> #define ;; ;exit(0);
15:44 < BotoX> :-)
15:45 <@matricks> ... can you do that?
15:45 < botnik> http://i.imgur.com/kHKDTzu.gif
15:49 < BotoX> Let me try it out :o
15:49 <@matricks> pretty sure it has to be alphanumeric
15:50 < LittleWhite> why would you do that ?
15:50 <@matricks> LittleWhite: to annoy people
15:50 < LittleWhite> matricks: What a wonderful plan
15:50 < BotoX>  error: macro names must be identifiers
15:50 < BotoX> :(
15:50 <@matricks> BotoX: thought that
15:51 < BotoX> http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500
15:51 < BotoX> Archer C5 has identical hardware to Archer C7 v2.0
15:52 < BotoX> 40€ price difference between the two
15:52 < BotoX> 50€ for a openwrt compatible 2.4 and 5ghz ac router isn't bad, is it?
16:48 <@minus> hello LittleWhite
16:49 <@minus> BotoX: that's quite good. not so much my 90€ non-openwrt comaptible E3000
16:49 < BotoX> oh, it's 60€ on amazon sale in a few minutes btw
16:49 < BotoX> not 50 :v
16:50 <@minus> do you need a new one?
16:50 < BotoX> It doesn't cut it anymore with all the other wifi networks around me
16:50 < BotoX> It's like 5 years old anyways 
16:50 < BotoX> 100mbit
16:50 <@minus> so you need moar transmission power? :D
16:51 < BotoX> ye :3
16:51 <@minus> oh, fair enough
16:51 <@minus> set it to 1W :3
16:51 < BotoX> hi government agency party bus
16:51 < BotoX> aka. RTR
16:51 < BotoX> Rundfunkregulierungs something
16:52 <@minus> you honestly think the austrian government is capable of surveilling the internets?
16:52 < BotoX> idk about that
16:52 < BotoX> but if people complain that their wifi is broken
16:52 < BotoX> and some technician starts measuring around
16:52 <@minus> aye
16:53 <@minus> well, higher transmission power on one device doesn't really help
16:53 < BotoX> ye
16:53 < BotoX> http://martin-p.blogspot.co.at/2014/09/tp-link-archer-c5-with-openwrt.html
16:53 < BotoX> Seems like the device is semi-capable of transmitting at 1W
16:54 < BotoX> The router that I use in my school is sending with 500mW
16:54 <@minus> 316mW at 2.4GHz :o
16:54 < BotoX> Well, with 5GHz I don't really need that anyways
16:54 <@minus> router at school with 5GHz?
16:54 < BotoX> nope 2.4ghz
16:54 <@minus> 500mW at 2.4GHz is illegal afaik
16:54 < BotoX> I know
16:54 <@minus> oh, the one you deployed
16:55 < BotoX> I want to upgrade my current one because there are like 30 2.4GHz networks around me
16:55 < BotoX> yeah :p
16:55 < BotoX> everything >100mW is illegal
16:55 <@minus> indoors, yes
16:56 <@minus> 4 wifi networks in range here, 1 my own, 2 from the direct neighbour, not bad, right?
16:56 < BotoX> ye
16:58 < LittleWhite> Hello minus:)
16:59 <@minus> didn't know you play teeworlds
17:00 < LittleWhite> I told you once, I think
17:00 < BotoX> http://www.amazon.de/dp/B00D8XXDB4/
17:00 < BotoX> 58 yuros
17:00 < BotoX> not bad
17:00 < BotoX> gonna buy
17:00 < LittleWhite> but first time I am going on this channel
17:01 < LittleWhite> We are playing with workmates 
17:01 < LittleWhite> I have to go for now
17:01 < LittleWhite> see you
17:02 <@minus> cya
17:03 <@minus> i played with my colleagues once, i guess there's no need to tell what happened
17:03 < LittleWhite> :)
17:03 <@matricks> minus: you got fired?
17:04 <@minus> matricks: no, i didn't play against the boss
20:18 < JulianAssange> why do girls want me to shave my legs
20:22 <@matricks> you look like a wookie?
20:24 <@minus> when you parse your own internal error message strings to print an appropriate message on the console, i think you're doing something wrong, don't you think so too?
20:24 <@matricks> yes
