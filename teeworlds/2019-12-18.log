21:11 < day> chillerdragon: btw. is it possible to get kick rights on your server?
21:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well i think all teams signed up are well trained pro players
21:12 < day> or is that only doable with full admin rights?
21:12 < Dune> day, we can just skip the boring stuff and play the winners
21:12 < day> ^
21:12 < day> well you can't play yourself, can you?

21:13 < Dune> yeah you can: https://twitter.com/FGRibreau/status/1080810518493966337
