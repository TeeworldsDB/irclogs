14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> do teeworlds failed assertions create a core dump ?
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (if the unlimited coredump option is enabled at least)
14:49 < Dune> why doesn't ctf5 have a ninja spot by the way?
14:49 < Dune> if there is one map where non-competitive elements should be added, it's ctf5
15:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Haha somehow true.. but since it is usually played and hosted by people who have no clue about the setting. It would always be activated and then the game is full of the worst weapon.
15:35 < Dune> it's bad in competitive, but I think casual players would find it fun
