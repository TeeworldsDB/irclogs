20:37 <@matricks> no, success
20:37 <@matricks> much better
20:37 < MoOoRice> hi
20:44 < MoOoRice> I have compilation errors for Teeworlds with CodeBlocks/MinGW/Win8.1 is this the right chanel ?
20:44 <@matricks> more or less
20:44 <@matricks> don't think mingw is supported to teeworlds under windows
20:45 < MoOoRice> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11194
20:45 < MoOoRice> it looked like
20:46 <@matricks> coo
20:46 < MoOoRice> coo ?
20:47 < LittleWhite> l
20:47 < MoOoRice> ah ok x)
20:47 < LittleWhite> So what are the errors
20:48 < MoOoRice> ||=== teeworlds, Server Debug ===|
20:48 < MoOoRice> src\game\gamecore.h|193|error: 'CNetObj_PlayerInput' does not name a type|
20:48 < MoOoRice> src\game\gamecore.h|202|error: 'CNetObj_CharacterCore' does not name a type|
20:48 < MoOoRice> src\game\gamecore.h|202|error: ISO C++ forbids declaration of 'pObjCore' with no type [-fpermissive]|
20:48 < MoOoRice> src\game\gamecore.h|203|error: 'CNetObj_CharacterCore' has not been declared|
20:48 < MoOoRice> [and more similar errors]
20:48 <@matricks> huh
20:48 <@matricks> is that the first errors?
20:49 < MoOoRice> yes ^^
20:49 < MoOoRice> I'm using a very recent version of bam
20:49 <@minus> wild guess: the netcode was not generated?
20:49 < MoOoRice> could it be the cause ?
20:49 <@matricks> whouldn't pose a problem
20:49 < MoOoRice> netcode ? x)
20:50 <@matricks> minus: well, then the compiler should complain about an include missing
20:51 < MoOoRice> my source comes from teeworlds-0.6.3-src.zip
20:57 < LittleWhite> Car you get this version : https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds
20:57 < LittleWhite> And retry, please
20:57 <@matricks> why from me?
20:57 < LittleWhite> because I missed it :(
20:57 <@matricks> heh
20:57 < LittleWhite> Sorry , I will get back the good link
20:58 <@matricks> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds
20:58 < LittleWhite> matricks: I have a question so
20:58 < LittleWhite> matricks: Why, the main is forked from yours
20:58 < LittleWhite> and not in the other way, that would look more "logical"
20:58 <@matricks> because I'm not developing any longer
20:59 <@matricks> the whole things started at my github
20:59 < LittleWhite> I see
21:00 <@matricks> here, have some Diablo Swing Orchestra: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkASQY-G_ZI

21:02 < LittleWhite> What do you mean ?
21:02 <@matricks> I've done some fun work on my branches of teeworlds
21:02 < LittleWhite> I will try it
21:02 <@minus> RIP ressys

21:04 <@matricks> minus: lua gamecode
21:05 < MoOoRice> codeblocks appcrash when trying to "add files recursively" to the project.... -_-
21:05 <@matricks> lol
21:07 <@matricks> the ressys branch is kinda intressting.. that thing only needs the exe on the client side
21:07 <@matricks> rest can be loaded from http or the game server
21:07 <@minus> yet it's not merged into teeworlds
21:07  * minus blames matricks
21:07 < MoOoRice> xD
21:08 <@matricks> not completed
21:08  * minus blames matricks even more
21:08 <@matricks> damn it
21:08 <@matricks> borderfix.. so the borderfix tool isn't needed any more
21:08 < LittleWhite> matricks: What are you doing now ?
21:08 <@matricks> dilatefix.. fixes.. well.. the dilate stuff
21:08 < LittleWhite> Wonderful code on new projects ?
21:08 <@matricks> LittleWhite: working, and being awesome on my spare time
21:09 <@minus> not awesome with candela anymore though!
21:09 <@matricks> minus: naa, not this year either

21:15 < LittleWhite> Great works guys 
21:16 <@minus> last demo's already been 3 years
21:16 <@minus> about as long as i've wanted to make one
21:16 <@minus> " :D "
21:16 <@matricks> 3 years.. yap.. thats when I started flying

21:19 < MoOoRice> damn !
21:19 < MoOoRice> I have no Python on my PC
21:19 < MoOoRice> that may be the cause right ? :D
21:19 < LittleWhite> MoOoRice: yeas
21:19 < LittleWhite> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs&wiki=compiling_everything
21:19 < LittleWhite> It written there ;)
21:19 < LittleWhite> My english is so bad :(
21:24 < MoOoRice> I know but it's also indicated that you need MS Visual Shit ++
21:24 <@minus> indeed, worse than matricks'
21:24 < MoOoRice> which may not be mandatory ^^
21:34 < LittleWhite> my ressys version can't load any data files ... :(
21:35 <@matricks> needs some setup I think
21:35 < LittleWhite> I am guessing the same ... I am trying to cheat it
21:36 <@matricks> https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds/blob/ressys/src/engine/client/client.cpp#L2427
21:36 <@matricks> https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds/blob/ressys/src/engine/client/source_http.cpp#L54
21:36 <@matricks> that data is no longer on that server
21:37 <@minus> oh you
21:37 <@matricks> I reinstalled my server recently
21:37 <@matricks> failing disc
21:37 <@minus> you're running off optical media?
21:38 <@matricks> hdd
21:38 <@minus> it's disk then :D
21:38 < LittleWhite> Got it \ o /
21:39 < LittleWhite> I love having it crashing with seg fault at closure
21:40 <@matricks> oh well
21:40  * matricks is in bed slowing down

21:43 <@matricks> the tee is an old mascot for one of teetows old bands

21:43 <@matricks> MoOoRice: me? 0
21:43 < MoOoRice> yes
21:43 < jxsl13> 0 hours?
21:43 <@matricks> yes
21:43 < jxsl13> Like some kinda sixth sense I got
21:44 < MoOoRice> you stopped development ?
21:44 <@matricks> I stopped developing yes
21:44 < LittleWhite> Because he is making a demo ! \ o /
21:44 <@matricks> LittleWhite: nope :)
21:45 < LittleWhite> :p
21:45 < MoOoRice> did you find a wife and a job and made children thanks to teeworlds' fame so now you don't have any time left in your life ?
21:46 <@matricks> job I always had, no wife, no gf, no children
21:46 <@matricks> MoOoRice: started being awesome and doing other stuff :)
21:46 < jxsl13> e.g. :O?
21:46 < MoOoRice> what do you mean ? x)
21:47 <@matricks> I work, I fly and I climb now adays :)
21:47 <@matricks> not much energy left for hobby codin'
21:47 < jxsl13> flying humans :O that's epicness over lvl 9000
21:47 < MoOoRice> xD
21:47 < LittleWhite> jxsl13: Flying coders could be more epic then
21:48 < jxsl13> true+
21:48 < MoOoRice> yaaaah I compiled Teeworld B-)
21:48 < LittleWhite> me too :D
21:48 < LittleWhite> twice :D
21:48 < MoOoRice> Compie Teeworlds : Check
21:48 < MoOoRice> Fly : TODO
21:49 < LittleWhite> MoOoRice: Will you code/contribute ?
21:49 < MoOoRice> i'm not sure, I'm just curious and boring x)
21:50 < jxsl13> https://github.com/uptee/uptee
22:09 < MoOoRice> how do you connect to the server console ?
22:11 < LittleWhite> F2
22:11 < LittleWhite> but, it has to be configurated
22:13 < MoOoRice> F2 ? When I start the server I have no console nor console x)
22:13 < MoOoRice> GUI*
22:13 < heinrich5991> MoOoRice: you have to connect to the server via the client
22:14 < MoOoRice> thanks ^^
22:16 < jxsl13> econ
23:51 < MoOoRice> what is Teeworlds 0.6.3's server port number
23:51 < MoOoRice> ?
23:51 < LittleWhite> 8305 I think
23:52 < LittleWhite> But not 100 % , but I think I have seen this number earlier 
23:52 < teetow> 8303?
23:52 < MoOoRice> I have read that it should be 8303
23:52 < MoOoRice> but I currentl have server running and this port is not open
23:52 < MoOoRice> and I can join the server with my client
23:52 < MoOoRice> damn ! it's UDP port ?!
23:53 < teetow> think so
23:53 < teetow> TCP is kinda pointless for games
23:54 < teetow> "excuse me, could you resend that packet I was supposed to get five frames ago? I need it for... uh... the archives."
