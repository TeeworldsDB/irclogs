00:02 < heinrich5991> thanks for the video, matricks :)
14:04 < Teectac> anyone knows what the first 6 bytes represent in a teeworlds upd packet ? they seem to always be 0xff
14:06 <@matricks> Teectac: thats only for connectionless packets
15:24 <@matricks> nameless_tee98: please take it in the channel
15:24 < nameless_tee98> Should I write in here?
15:24 <@matricks> yes
15:25 < nameless_tee98> Okay, I've got a short question about the laser code in tw.
15:25 <@matricks> and this is why you should write it in here, so anyone can answer your question :)
15:27 < nameless_tee98> Kk :), the question is: Why does the direction have to be multiplicated by 4.0f in this line (https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/server/entities/laser.cpp#L59)?
15:27 <@matricks> so it becomes a bit longer after a bounce
15:27 <@matricks> or wait.. what
15:28 <@matricks> oh.. yeah.. probably to get a correct bounce
15:28 < nameless_tee98> But what is it important for? :/
15:28 <@matricks> so it actually touches the wall when it moves
15:28 <@matricks> the direction is then normalized again
15:28 <@matricks> it's to get rid of floating point corner cases
15:28 <@matricks> when the laser exactly touches the wall
15:29 < nameless_tee98> the bounce is done by Collision()->MovePoint(), I tested multiplicating it with 1.0f and got the same laser result
15:29 < nameless_tee98> ah okay
15:29 <@matricks> yeah, there are really specific cases where it doesn't work
15:29 < nameless_tee98> floating point corner cases when the direction isn't long enough?
15:30 <@matricks> well, cases where the intersect will hit, but not the movepoint
15:30 < nameless_tee98> oh, okay, that answered my question. thank you^^
16:04 < nameless_tee98> have a nice day :P
19:06 < Teectac> here is an idea : record the ratio #kills / (#death + #kills) over all games played by a tee and publish it to joined servers
19:07 < Teectac> servers publish mean / deviation skill ratios in the server list so people can join servers of their level
19:09 < Teectac> then, an option to reject tees 2-3 sigma away from the mean
19:09 < Teectac> what do you think ?
19:10 < Dunedune> i don't like the idea of having to level up on bad servers to join another one
19:10 < Dunedune> i may just want to spectate a game of my friends, right?
19:12 < Teectac> sure, lets say instead of rejecting tees they become spectators
19:13 < Teectac> it could not even be a default
19:17 < Teectac> but i wonder if that ratio would be enough to represent one's skill
19:18 < Teectac> maybe we could get creative here
19:41 < Teectac> think of it as another indicator in the server list like the presence of friends already is
19:42 < Teectac> or maybe its the root of all evil ^^
22:42 < heinrich5991> Teectac: people will start optimizing against that metric, starting to spawncamp
22:42 < heinrich5991> (see e.g. how the strategy in the  build mod developed)
23:12 < Teectac> maybe the metric can be improved ?
23:17 < Teectac> and even if it can be gamed, teeworlds already relies on fair players to survive
23:18 < Teectac> spawncampers will get huge scores and get kicked out of lower level games
