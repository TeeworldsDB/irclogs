11:05 < rand> I thought assert are to be removed in release build or may become warning messages (instead of instant crash)
12:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> this is the case for C's built-in asserts with -DNODEBUG, it's not the case for rust's asserts, it is theoretically the case with python's asserts (but no one uses python -O because the only thing it does is strip the asserts)
12:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it varies by programming language. see my opinion above about disabling them
