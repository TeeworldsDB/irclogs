00:00 <@matricks> Kirbs: irc might be the wrong place to hunt
00:01 < Kirbs> heh
01:05 < Edible> craigslist?
01:06 <@matricks> your moms bedroom?
01:08 < Kirbs> new york?
01:17 <@matricks> she is omnislut, she is everywhere at once
01:18 <@matricks> :P
01:18 <@matricks> don't listen to me
13:21 < Stitch626> there is someone faking our server, the fake-ip is 31.186.250.187, port 8303, the original server is hosted by wolfalex. is there a way for a masterserver ban?
13:45 < Stitch626> -- status update -- server is offline..
14:21 < Flutterbat> Stitch626: how do they fake a server without having access to the ip?
14:21 < Flutterbat> or do you mean they are tainting your "brand"? :D
14:26 < Stitch626> tainting? faking is faking, whats unclear?
14:52 <@heinrich5991> Flutterbat: reverse proxying
14:53 <@heinrich5991> i.e. make a server that forwards everything to the real server, but saves all the data sent
14:53 <@heinrich5991> latter part is optional
14:55 < Flutterbat> so just a mirror that doesnt mirror but forward. is that a major problem in teeworlds?
14:55 < Flutterbat> i can see how it could become one if exploids exist in the client
14:56 < Flutterbat> but there are no weakspots, right heinrich5991 ? :>
14:56 <@heinrich5991> passwords mostly
14:56 < Flutterbat> passwords?
14:57 <@heinrich5991> rcon password, server password or some account password for a mod
14:57 < Flutterbat> ahh you mean if the admin logs in
14:57 <@heinrich5991> yes
14:57 < Flutterbat> i see
14:57 < k00mi> passwords are sent plaintext to the server?
14:58 < Flutterbat> even if they arent you can grab them i guess
14:59 < koomi> not necessarily, no
14:59 < Flutterbat> eh?
14:59 < Flutterbat> client <---> proxy <---> server
14:59 < koomi> you can send a hash
14:59 < koomi> hm, no
14:59 < Flutterbat> ah thats what you mean
14:59 < Flutterbat> i was thinking encryption
15:00 < koomi> actually, you need a challenge-response mechanism
15:00 < koomi> but it's certainly possible
15:01 <@heinrich5991> I think what you can't do without public key cryptography is preventing the man in the middle from inserting or dropping rcon commands
15:01 < nheir> how do you trust the host ? knows public key ?
15:01 <@heinrich5991> and this means once an admin logs in the proxy can just keep this session open
15:01 < nheir> *known
15:01 < nheir> heinrich5991: +1
15:02 <@matricks> heinrich5991: or you have to challane each command
15:02 <@heinrich5991> ok, but this still allows the attacker to drop packets
15:02 <@heinrich5991> not as bad, but can still have interesting side-effects
15:03 <@matricks> remote rcon, let ssh deal with that shit
15:03 <@heinrich5991> and if oyu change the rcon password while logged in, the attacker also has it
15:03 <@heinrich5991> see econ :)
15:03 < Stitch626> heinrich, don't forget my solution of the problem with rcon passwords..
15:03 < koomi> so are passwords sent plaintext to the server?
15:03 <@matricks> I mean, you are basicly doing a new ssh
15:03 <@matricks> don't do that
15:03 <@heinrich5991> koomi: yes
15:04 < nheir> ssh server 'telnet localhost port' â™¥
15:05 < Flutterbat> i found that teeworlds servers are a splendid way to find new homes for teamspeak nomads
15:05 <@matricks> heinrich5991: dunno how econ works
15:08 <@matricks> whole rcon is just the path of least resistance, and it kinda gotten left in there
