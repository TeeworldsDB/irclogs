21:39 < daey_> im having trouble with teeworlds in window mode on linux. my cursor is fixed in the upper left corner. i can still move it (very little).
21:40 < daey_> playing in fullscreen works, but a. that turns my 2nd screen black and b. i can only play @60hz
22:24 < Stitch626> 60hz = disable vsync
22:25 < Stitch626> cursor issue sounds like touch input for me
22:26 < Stitch626> maybe it helps to increase/decrease the inp_mousesens setting
