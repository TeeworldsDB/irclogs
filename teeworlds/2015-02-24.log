21:02 < chsk> also i really hate the new style of the docs :<
21:02 <@minus> oh, cool, thanks chsk
21:02 <@minus> my googling was too specific to ldap i guess
21:02 < heinrich5991> "the old design was better"
21:03 < heinrich5991> but yea, looks a bit confusing, not sure why though
21:03 <@minus> heinrich5991: yes, building something to admin ldap users, because running shit with a shell script is a pain
