00:58 < teeworlds_rocks> Hey. What files/methods would I have to look into if I wanted to redirect a user to another server? I've seen that on 0.6 and I'm wondering how hard that would be to implement without changing the server engine too much.
01:03 <@heinrich5991> redirecting isn't possible, so what you're looking for is reverse-proxying the clients
01:05 < teeworlds_rocks> heinrich5991: thanks, I'll look into that
01:36 < rand> that's what some fake servers were doing to steal players credentials on other modded servers iirc
12:28 < teeworlds_rocks> rand: I only want to "redirect" specific users to other ports on my server, nothing else
12:28 < teeworlds_rocks> for some mod I'm thinking about doing
12:28 < teeworlds_rocks> nothing malicious
12:32 < teeworlds_rocks> or if it's possible to change the map only for some players, I'd also take that^^
12:33 <@heinrich5991> you can send a ChangeMap to the clinets
12:34 < teeworlds_rocks> heinrich5991: for example if two players want to duel each other, they'll be sent to another map while the other players stay on the old one (including new players who join)?
12:34 <@heinrich5991> but note that the current server code isn't architectured in a way that allows for this easily
12:34 <@heinrich5991> yes, you can do that
12:34 < teeworlds_rocks> ok cool that might be better
14:16 < rand> it looks hard to implement but interesting, good luck :)
15:19 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] Dune-jr opened pull request #1904: Always use colorful gametype and level icons in the browser instead of grayscale (master...feature-colorful-browser) https://git.io/fppzJ
15:55 < teeworlds_rocks> yeah colored icons look better, especially to distinguish the different skill levels
16:04 < teeworlds_rocks> also in the browser players aren't correctly sorted after applying the 'hide bots' option
16:04 < teeworlds_rocks> not sure if that's intended
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> some people stole and leaked my mod with that feature, feelsbadman
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> and it got intern leaked
16:08 < Oy> that sorted was already fixed on github
16:09 < teeworlds_rocks> ah I see
16:14 < Dune> o/
16:14 < rand> @FluffiexD which feature ? multi game on one server ?
16:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> yes
16:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> it can ez improved and can be more flexible
16:15 < teeworlds_rocks> you might as well leak it to github now :D
16:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> so i could make it globally work on different servers
16:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> no
16:16 < rand> did you have a limit on the number of clients you have ?
16:18 < rand> wonder if integrating an irc client on teeworlds is useful
16:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> max is 256
16:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> but it can be more
16:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> unlimited if i want
16:19 < rand> then, you can chat with people to choose a server afterward instead of using an additional server
16:20 < rand> does your server spawn game server on demand ?
16:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> how do u mean on demand?
16:21 < rand> if 256 players want to play on their own ctf server to train their capture speed 
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> ah
16:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> i dont accept demands, but it could possible too for user to add their own servers with command + login into their accs
16:23 < rand> so, you only are a proxy ?
16:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> no
16:24 < rand> (a powerful proxy)
16:24 < rand> what were the server players were playing on ?
16:25 < rand> (you said "their own servers")
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> the feature isnt possible for users, but i can add with commands servers
16:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> only for admins
16:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> and it was only intented for blocker servers
16:28 < Dune> rand: multiple clients did irc integration iirc
16:28 < Dune> e.g. Henningsttwo's 
16:28 < rand> I'm confused, do the (blocker) servers run on the same (teeworlds) server ?
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> true
16:28 < rand> or are there multiple binaries ?
16:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> nope
16:29 < rand> ok
16:30 < rand> Dune: can't wait not to see this feature in official teeworlds :D
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> oh god
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> pls no
16:38 < Dune> rand: I tried to implement one myself 8 years ago and failed, never touched IRC since :D
16:39 < Dune> your turn
16:39 < rand> I don't want to see this in tw official
16:40 < rand> it is a thought experiment
16:41 < rand> tutorial and AI are much more interesting and challenging 
16:44 < Oy> had one integrated in 0.4 or 0.5 times 
16:48 < teeworlds_rocks> the AI on the test server feels so unnatural
16:49 < teeworlds_rocks> the reflexes are way too good
16:49 < teeworlds_rocks> I don't like it when somebody instahooks me whenever I get into their range :D
16:49 < Dune> and it got nerfed :D
16:50 < Oy> are based on the ones from sushi?
16:50 < Oy> *+they
17:08 < rand> mines are not
17:19 < Oy> ok
17:21 < rand> (also from scratch)
17:23 < rand> I read about quake bots but the overall system is a bit complex to me to adapt in teeworlds
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @FluffiexD nobo if u develop open source on github for everyone you can't be leaked :p
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> didnt
17:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> if somebody login into server via ur email and get out pw, sad life asf
17:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> chiller and if u have no idea, then be quiet pls
17:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> if somebody login into server via ur email/pw on panel and get  pw, sad life asf
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> As far as I know it was your roommate who leaked it?
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> true
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> closed src sucks thats a fact
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> you 2
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> u
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> gamecontext.cpp 20k lines
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> character.cpp 20k lines function xd
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> ye thats sad on your mod xd
17:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> u
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> didnt you stole it back then?
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> make no sense if its from me and 13x37
17:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> how can i steal it back?
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> No i mean back then when i was a closed src nobo i gave my source to Marcella and then i saw a very very similar mod with specific commands like /dummy on the exec Starblock server
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> you are talking about the old old mod
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yy
17:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> pre BW and pre everything
17:32 < Oy> hm, that empty vote thing ain't that simple to fix ...
17:32 < Dune> err
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh we are in the official irc
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> marcella said, made it by himself
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sorry for offtopic -.-
17:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> marcella nobo xxxD and he kicked me out of credits completly
17:33 < Dune> Oy: I guess you have to add a flag somewhere "ReasonLoaded", init it to 0, then set it to 1 at the first callvote message?
17:33 < Oy> would need to add stuff here https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/datasrc/network.py#L6
17:33 < Dune> but would be nice if server sent the reason too :|
17:35 < Oy> it sends vote_unknown so it doesn't create the xxx started vote blabla when u join and it's already running
17:35 < Oy> but that's only one and can't build correct description for kick and spectate votes
17:37 < Oy> well probably best to just use them. have to live with that chat msg till 0.8
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 0.8 lol
17:44 < rand> i don't know how mail/login leaks is related to opensource
17:46 < rand> and at this point, I m afraid to ark
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> if my  roommate logging in into acc to get serverpw
17:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> make sense?
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> without permissions and download the files on usb or on his pc with root pw
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> rip
17:48 < rand> open source does not mean open config
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> why u say config to it?
17:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> do u know what happen with my old mod?
17:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> somebody of devs had depressions and published it ony github, because he didnt get attention, if i have no time for him aka. Rei
17:52 < rand> i dont understand serverpw can be linked publishing sources
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> rand: in this case there would be no motivation to enter @FluffiexD s server with serverpw to get the code if it was public anyways
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> somebody went to his server to steal something what should be public in my eyes anyways
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> @ChillerDragon lets publish ur own nudes of ur mobile phone
17:53 < rand> that's noq the point
17:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> the world needs them
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> there are no nudes :p
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> its a funny comparison
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i publish 99% of the data i own
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> lets say to google, gimme srv
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> src*
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> or facebook
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea would be nice
17:54 < Dune> you might want to take that conversation on another channel
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes i am so sorry
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> we should stop here
17:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> :c
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> i wouldnt discuss with him anyway, its dumb
17:55 < rand> Dune: meh
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> its like to give everyone a key for r home
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> its like to give everyone a key for ur home
17:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> stap edit msgs they get resent on irc
17:56 < rand> I don't care about the status of the source, I won't play on it but it's my choice as much as it was your choice not to publish the source
17:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> but apparently he does not accept that I do not want to publish it
17:56 < rand> my question is : how publishing the source make your personal data leaks ? (except of mail address that can appear in commits)
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> if u live with another one in a commune for a year
17:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> it explains it to yourself?
17:58 < rand> you mean,the verly lines of code are your personal data ?
17:58 < Dune> My guess would be that they commit everything to github, including the .cfg
17:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> no
17:58 < Dune> Wrong guess :(
17:59 < rand> I'm trying not to guess ^^
17:59 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy pushed 1 new commit to master: https://git.io/fpp7p
17:59 < Teeworlds> teeworlds/master 9099a69 oy: fixed empty vote when joining a server. closes #1887
17:59 < rand> teeworlds source are open, but it does not mean people can access each computer/server which is running a teeworlds server
18:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> teeworlds standard is opensrc
18:00 < rand> it's the same with every opensource server application (webserver, dns, proxy etc)
18:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> thats true
18:00 < Dune> oy: no client side fix then?
18:00 < Dune> thx for doing it btw: )
18:01 < rand> well, teeworlds mod can be closed, that's why it is indeed up to the dev
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> but if u make an own mod when nobody else has acces to it and its not opensrc that specific mod
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> and if somebody steal it from you
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> how you would call it?
18:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> closed opensrc?
18:02 < rand> you are telling us that the whole email/pw/etc stuff was a image to illustrate your point ?
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> *facepalm*
18:03 < rand> and tht the only thing that was stolen was the source ?
18:04 < Oy> Dune: just server sided. and it seems the client drops the according chat msg cause it's still somehow connecting - so everything is smooth :D
18:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> everything on the server
18:04 < rand> not that it has no value
18:04 < rand> ok
18:04 < rand> but how your mail/pw was leaked ?
18:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> stolen by my own commune mate
18:04 < Dune> Oy: cool :)
18:05 < Oy> looking into the motd thing now
18:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> do u know save password options...
18:05 < rand> then, it's not because of your mod becoming opensource that your whole data on your server was stolen but because of this your mod became "opensource"
18:07 < Dune> `error: ‘const struct CNetObj_PlayerInfo’ has no member named ‘m_ClientID’`
18:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> you confuse me rand
18:07 < Dune> uh, I missed a chapter
18:08 < rand> is the opensource issue the cause or the consequence of your roomate stealing your data ?
18:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> ye
18:11 < Oy> Dune: the scoreboard probably closes the motd https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/components/scoreboard.cpp#L648
18:12 < rand> I understood at first that was the cause
18:13 < Dune> aah
18:14 < rand> it's a feature !
18:14 < Dune> haha
18:14 < Oy> revert it?
18:14 < Dune> manually opening the scoreboard should turn off the MOTD probably
18:14 < Dune> it's going to be ugly otherwise
18:15 < Oy> could add more alpha to the motd background so it still looks good with open scoreboard
18:15 < Dune> sounds good
18:17 < Dune> coding with MS fonts on linux is awful
20:20 < teeworlds_rocks> https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=docs is outdated btw.
20:21 < teeworlds_rocks> e.g, sv_spectator_slots -> sv_player_slots
20:23 < teeworlds_rocks> I think I had to look into the source code when I configured my servers a few days ago^^
20:24 <@Dune> teeworlds_rocks: you can, report doc issues there https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/issues
20:42 < teeworlds_rocks> ah there's already a PR which addresses this
20:49 <@Dune> TIl issues can be pinned on github
20:50 <@heinrich5991> TIL
20:50 <@heinrich5991> how?
20:51 <@Dune> https://puu.sh/CjGTZ/2e3d8b47b2.png
20:52 <@heinrich5991> huh
20:52 <@heinrich5991> looks new, with that "beta" thing
20:52 <@Dune> yeah
23:05 < rand> Dune: when using the "left of 1", I get "&178" as bind
23:06 < rand> and it works in-game
23:06 <@Dune> huh, thanks
23:06 < rand> (at least with +nextwepaon
23:06 < rand> (using teeworlds/master)
23:07 <@Dune> ty
23:07 <@Dune> works
