12:39 < Kayoku_> Hii ! I'm student in computer science (with 4 others friends) and we are looking for a free project to help development. The most recent commit of TW is December 2015, the community is active or not rly ? 
12:49 <@matricks> Kayoku_: sporadic development I would say
13:03 < Kayoku_> Ok ok. Thx :)
13:12 < daey> Kayoku_: from what i can tell, heinrich5991 seems to be one of the "active" devs.
13:12 <@minus> will 0.7 be released 2016? i wonder
13:12 < Henningstone> everybody does
13:13 < daey> the problem is, non of the releases since what? 0.4? added anything to the game from the players point of view :P
13:13 < Kayoku_> Mmmh ok. So i'll often be here :D
13:19 <@matricks> daey: nothing really worth adding :)
13:20 < daey> matricks: but i want to waste my money on ingame cosmetics T_T
13:20 < Henningstone> daey: pay somebody for creating you a skin
13:21 < daey> pff. teeworlds transformed me into an inkscape master
13:21 < Kayoku_> Just do it :D
13:22 < Henningstone> so then do it the other way around: get payed for creating skins :D
13:22 < daey> i will add an "/s" next time...
