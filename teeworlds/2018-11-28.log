09:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Fisico sorry for repeatig my self. But i never put any file into the other folder. If SDL is globally installed with brew all works fine out of the box if u freshly clone it. Do you use the homebrew package manager on mac?
10:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oy: i think the old storage is even worse because the $DATADIR is missing and the app is not working aswell

14:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> rand: wouldn't you prefer a scrollbar? just asking
14:59 < rand> dunno, it sounds like the (second) easier UI solution
15:00 < rand> I'm not sure it would be good for user experience
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> The one you made without any tabs/scrollbars looks fine to me
15:05 < rand> the last one ?
15:06 < rand> I have to make something when there is 16 to 32 players and 33 to 48 players then
15:07 < rand> the spectator part for the scoreboard can also be discussed
15:11 < rand> I cropped it to 4 lines (as the original scoreboard) but I didn't add '‚Ä¶' to signal it

17:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> need to change that: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/4cae6900e56004a2722a65bd1857b6de5baa4459/src/game/client/components/scoreboard.cpp#L574
19:23 < Dune> heyy Landil :)
19:24 < Landil> hej Dune
19:24 < Dune> lil landils giving you a break?
19:24 < Dune> :D
19:24 < Landil> what's the next hot topic
19:24 < Dune> severak
19:25 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1390
19:25 < Dune> we need graphics to indicate bots
19:25 < Landil> :rollingeyes: not really *muhaawaaaah*
19:25 < Dune> oy proposed an antenna iirc
19:25 < Dune> haha
19:25 < Landil> maybe a robot skin?
19:25 < Dune> ideally only a part
19:25 < Dune> so they can still have custom skins :)
19:26 < Dune> could be decoration
19:26 < Dune> there's also this but you already discussed a while ago: https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1732
19:27 < Landil> Dune ... step by step please
19:27 < Landil> what's THE hottest topic I should have a look at?
19:27 < Dune> hmmm
19:27 < Dune> well we're sort of done with the *necessary* gfx for the release
19:28 < Dune> there's UI design if you do that too
19:28 < Dune> but no gfx necessary for 0.7.1
19:30 < Landil> gimme some screenshots on which I can have a look at pls
19:31 < Dune> mm
19:32 < Dune> http://puu.sh/C9aKm/20db2aa6e8.jpg
19:32 < Dune> this is for the UI
19:32 < Dune> we would kind of like to have the join/disconnect buttons more readily accessible
19:34 < Dune> but the reset button is annoying =p
19:43 < Landil> maybe one could use an "undo arrow" instead
19:43 < Landil> hummmm
19:44 < Landil> like ctrl+z in most applications
19:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that's a bunch of code
19:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think reset is useful regardless
19:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> sometimes you fuck up with the settings, right
19:45 < Landil> something like this
19:45 < Landil> https://www.shutterstock.com/sv/image-vector/refresh-engine-vector-icon-style-flat-325580300?src=8UGERBlEQtTqD2tY7elv3g-1-1
19:46 < Landil> but then this would be the only icon on the settings menu
19:46 < Landil> I don
19:46 < Landil> not like that
19:47 < Landil> well I cannot think of a solution better than the given one
19:47 < Landil> icon + button?
19:48 < Dune> hmm
19:48 < Dune> well there could be two layers of buttons
19:49 < Dune> https://i.imgur.com/0ilCu38.png
19:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Since when we need an icon for everything
19:56 < Landil> @sonix the more icons the less translation
19:57 < Landil> localisation is the worst feature ever
19:57 < Landil> lessons learned
19:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> also icons are cool
19:59 < Landil> you can clearly see the advantage of an icon at this screenshot https://i.imgur.com/0ilCu38.png How do you want to make it clear that the reset is related to the settings and not the disconnect?
19:59 < Dune> but then where would you put the icon? on every single line?
20:09 < Landil> https://imgur.com/a/TNVyXuT
20:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what's the use of the icon then, if I may ask?
20:12 < Landil> to make sure ppl understand that this is a reset settings button
20:13 < Landil> https://imgur.com/2GGpD7J does not look that cool
20:14 < Landil> but it is possible
20:14 < Landil> besides I am not that happy with the buttons at the bottom
20:15 < Landil> but I really like the new design :thumbs up:
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> The buttons at the bottom are just bad
20:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> any other solution to have a way to join/disconnect without moving the mouse everywhere on the screen? :/
20:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> 
20:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/517423755706892289/test_igmenu.png
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so put the buttons on top? I'd love it
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there is the "only x allowed" message there right now though
22:03 < rand> I don't know how I assume things were done at some point
22:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> don't put buttons back to the top pls :/
22:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I like this approuch here, but the icon should be simplefied https://imgur.com/2GGpD7J
22:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> we already have a reset icon btw. it's included in the sidebar image .png
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I'd suggest to keep reset text but add the icon additionally inside current or even to the left of current extending by the size of 1:1
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Zatline I don't understand why those buttons should be at the bottom
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's awful for the accessibility
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the mouse travels everywhere for basic stuff
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I don't think so I'm pretty used to it from other games
22:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> just a matter of getting used to
22:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> maybe
22:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> take Battlefield games as exampl 3 & 4 in particular these games inspired me a lot I love the UI there ^^
22:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I don't know how these games are
22:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> see u just not very used to it I guess
22:22 < rand> hm
22:23 < rand> I feel like Dune, choosing a game menu at top, then go down is a movement that was useless before
22:24 < rand> maybe I will change my mind too
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> https://gyazo.com/a462fbdc9a2b0d9a511e199c688b61be
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> https://gyazo.com/f59e8f83ca641f18e152c8f56d9a62c6
22:31 < rand> can you change team while in a game in BattleField ?
22:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> yes you could but they I think changed that with Battledield 1 and now Battlediel V I have not found the option there
22:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the thing is battlefield doesn't seem to have *tabs*
22:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> here, in order to click join/disconnect, you first have to move your mouse to the upper side of the screen, click game, then move all the way down and click disconnect
22:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> in bf u disconnect by going into the game menu so disconnect actually isn't there untill u hit esc first
22:35 <@Dune_> you understand the problem with teeworlds then?
22:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> Damn gotta travel 10 days to reach the bottom with my slow ass sens üòÅ
22:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> which kinda makes sense since when u want to leave / close an app u often hit escape to do so
22:36 <@Dune_> yeah but in teeworlds if you hit escape you may very well be somewhere in the menus
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> well I don't want to have a bottem cluster at the top while on the bottem is nothing I tryied to structure the mene evenly and use all space available which gives it a very clean look
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> and since I'm very used to deploy at the bottem I don't rly mind too much
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> deploying at the bottom isn't a problem when you don't have to click somewhere on the top first
22:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> deployment is part of the "game" menu not of the settings menu, so there is no need to have it shown while beeing in the settings menu
22:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but you understand the accessibility problem?
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> that of disconnect yea but that's it and there is an easy solution to it
22:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> and spectate?
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> why would u want to hit spectate when u in the setting menu? again .. it's not part of settings and so you shouldn't be able to click it in the first place lol
22:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> u don't go in the settings menu to spectate, you go in settings to change a setting
22:43 <@Dune_> yes, of course
22:43 <@Dune_> but a normal usecase would be Escape -> click a button to join/spectate/disconnect, right?
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> yea that button is ESC when playing u always start in the game menu
22:45 <@Dune_> in teeworlds, this is not what happens when you press ESC
22:45 <@Dune_> you go to whatever menus you were in last
22:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> if u then go into settings and close and hit esc again u reset at the game menu
22:45 < rand> this should change at least
22:45 <@Dune_> yeah, rand
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @Zatline no? I don't think so at least
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> if you go to settings, then close, then ESC, you go back to settings.
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> that's the problem
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> u should reset to game
22:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> fix either and it's fine by me
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> in 0.6 it does not reset to game and it is fine
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> because the buttons are on top
22:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the idea of having the buttons permanently there is that you can have the "save position in settings" functionality + easy access of important functions
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> but if we have to make it that Esc always sends to "Game" I'm fine with that too :)
22:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> it should solve the confuision problem
22:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> I myself are confused when going into settings hit esc ... play a bit then later want to disconnect and I suddenly in settings
22:50 <@Dune_> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1698
22:50 <@Dune_> this is the issue
22:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> it's weird u should always land in game default
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> yea and we had that discussion already and I suggested waht I'm suggestung rn ^^
22:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> yea we had that discussion already and I suggested waht I'm suggestung rn ^^
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> get rig of spectate, demo, joined buttoms when being in setting they don't belong there, default esc to game and everything should be fine
22:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Zatline> get rig of spectate, demo, joined buttons when being in setting they don't belong there, default esc to game and everything should be fine
22:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well there are two solutions to this problem
