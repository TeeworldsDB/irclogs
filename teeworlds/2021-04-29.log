00:58 < minus> if someone at $dayjob wants a non-app-store version of our app they need to somehow add their phone's id to the app build (or even register it with apple?). definitely not easy
01:07 < Dune> iirc that is 100$/month
01:07 < Dune> or you can make a temporary certificate that lasts 1 week 1?)
07:48 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> developer versions of iphone apps stop working after around one or two weeks if you manually install them from your mac. so you are forced to reinstall them every few days. maybe there is a better way.
12:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I had to do that every week for a medical app, the only way around is to pay the 100 bucks
18:08 < Learath2> or a jailbreak
19:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> or (doesn't help with devices you already have): don't buy limited computing devices
19:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> non-geeks have different priorities than us when picking their devices, it is not always that they ignore the issue
19:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> also, having a system that treats you as a dangerous wandering toddler who took possession of the device is a feature to some
19:22 < bridge_> [freenode] <chillerdragon[m]> xd
22:00 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Teeman (FriskGT)> hey
