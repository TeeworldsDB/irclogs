15:48 < day> Dune: :3
15:51 <@Dune> day: \o
15:56 < day> Dune: hows corona doing? :D
16:00 < day> "everything's" locked down again here till mid january >.>
16:38 <@Dune> At the contrary, we're celebrating the end of the lockdown here day
16:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> huh
16:38 <@Dune> I don't know anyone with corona here 
16:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> same here, not knowing anyone with corona. but:
16:39 <@Dune> My dentist refuses to wear masks so she can boost her immune system
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you mean "boost" the immune system of their patients? ^^
16:39 <@Dune> Also...
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in germany the lockdown has just increased, as we're still on an exponential curve with too many people already infected
16:40 <@Dune> Germany did well until now, didn't they
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> in retrospective, this should have happened earlier, but there was probably too little support for stricter measures earlier
16:41 <@Dune> Is popular support important?
16:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> they promised to loosen the restrictions on christmas, but this will likely lead to many infections
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> for rules you can't enforce, yes
16:42 <@Dune> oh right
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Ye this lockdown should have happened a lot earlier
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Now we getting new top infection counts and deaths
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> why can't you enforce rules? the police are there for exactly this
17:26 < ChillerDragon> you mean sending police to every house and checking the situation? Knock on every door?
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well total lockdown is easy to enforce, if someone is outside, send them back
17:28 <@Dune> @Learath2: you always have people who need to be outside, for work or otherwise, so checking on everyone isn't feasible
17:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Well work is verifiable, you can set up systems to verify someone is supposed to be outside for work
18:33 <@Dune> checking on those people requires a lot of manual work
19:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> DDR 2.0
