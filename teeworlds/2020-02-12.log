00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea well you mean using kicks and set_team to kill players on specific log events like flag caps and pickups
00:12 < Dune> yes
01:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> are there any shortcuts/hotkeys to select a section in the browser like All/Teeworlds/Favorites
01:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the keys A F and T would be awesome o.O
01:20 < Dune> no, especially since you can create and change the name of filters
01:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> about ipv6... the gameserver should support it or am i missing something?
01:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> is anybody working on a http master (if it's still a thing)? might be a good oppertunity to add dual stack support üôÇ
02:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, still working on it‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
02:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> dual stack support is already in the design
03:32 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> so rand my thinking on this is for the score rather than raw kill to be the basis for adjustment in ctf
03:33 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> so if you do this a lot but don't score, it nerfs you up, but if you start scoring that nerfing comes off, and if you're REALLY successful at it you get less HP from it to compensate for that so the noobs can catch up, or at least this is the idea
04:34 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> also on the raspi thing it looks like there's a broadcom chip that nobody has written a proper driver for?
09:25 < day> Dune: "nades are balanced in highlevel gameplay" I kek'd
12:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> gol√§ng r√ºst http masterserver >:D
12:14 < minus> did someone say rewriting mastersrv?
12:14 < minus> i did write one in python a long time ago
12:14 < minus> it would return servers in a different order, sending those where it thinks you have least latency first
12:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I find it kinda bad to hide these kinds of projects... let people see them >:O tell the world!
12:58 < Dune> minus: oh that's clever :)
12:59 < Dune> "where it thinks you have least latency", how would you think this?
12:59 < Dune> you just send the servers to which you have the least latency right
13:15 < minus> Dune: it groups servers per continent and sends servers from the same continent first
13:15 < Dune> ah, geolocates IP?
13:16 < minus> yeah
13:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> oh, that's nice :D
14:43 < rand> one step from censoreship
14:51 < day> nice finally we can get rid of those brazilians!
14:51 < day> i never understood the us players complaining about them, i thought they are like our french. but no, they are worse :D
14:51  * day shouts out to dune <3
14:52 < Dune> at least we are located just over the ardennes
14:52 < day> on a more serious note, I really can't comprehend why these 200+ms players are playing
14:53 < Dune> brazil is the other hemisphere for them
14:53 < day> yeah
14:56 < day> Dune: frickn heater is down in the office 3:
14:56 < day> freezing my ass off D:
14:56 < Dune> day: we keep the window open at all times
14:56 < Dune> this is because there is no ventilation
14:56 < Dune> so while the temperature would be fine, we are short in oxygen
14:56 < Dune> can't have everything!
14:56 < day> yeah same here normally, but with a heater on max below the window :P
14:57 < Dune> well I thought germany was heating up because of the coal plants but it turns out it's all you 
14:57 < day> luckily the building is spacious, so air isnt an issue
14:58 < Dune> it costs less to replace employees than to buy more space here
14:58 < Dune> feels like a ddrace map in here
14:58 < day> nah we import all your nice nuclear power, while we was our own hands in innocence <3
14:58 < day> was/wash
14:59 < day> Dune: the beauty of living rural. outside of my office i can see into a private garden. the guy breeds white pidgeons :D
15:00 < Dune> :(  uni is outside the city or it's completely rural?
15:00 < day> pretty rural in general. we dont have much true nature though (it's a agriculture between the towns)
15:01 < day> a/all
15:01 < Dune> gotta feed the humans
15:01 < Dune> dont think we have any display of agriculture in teeworlds
15:01 < Dune> do the fees get food anywhere except from ctf1 bushes
15:01 < Dune> tees*
15:01 < day> oh im farming newbs every day :p
15:01 < Dune> ooh :D
15:02 < Dune> wait till JewZeus hear about that
15:02 < day> Dune: https://www.google.com/maps/@52.0108997,7.8631383,8781m/data=!3m1!1e3
15:02 < day> :D
15:03 < day> he's on a mission! 
15:03 < Dune> looks pretty safe from terrorism
15:03 < day> :D
15:04 < day> they still take precautions though :|
15:05 < day> not in the towns, but theres a larger city nearby where they put up barriers during events
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> safe from terrorism, but not from teerrorism.
15:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> spread the game!
15:53 < day> teerible!
17:20 < Dune> should https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2466 really be fixed in the chat, instead of in the console? what's the convention for text colors in teeworlds?
17:21 < Dune> any component has to maintain the white color?
17:21 < Oy> yeah, if you change it you have to reset it at the end
17:21 < Dune> okay
21:41 < CrisGallar2> Hola
21:42 < CrisGallar2_> Hola
21:42 < CrisGallar2_> Hi
21:43 < Dune> CrisGallar2, moin
21:45 < CrisGallar2> hola
21:46 < Dune> yes?
21:46  * CrisGallar2 slaps CrisGallar2 around a bit with a large fishbot
21:47 < CrisGallar2>  how can i update cell phone teeworlds?
21:47 < Dune> teeworlds is PC only
21:50 < rand> but there exists an android version ^^ I guess it was not update since 6.3
21:53 < CrisGallar2> when he got on the phone to teeworlds he says that version 7.3 is available
21:55 < rand> because it doesn't ask for the last android version but the last teeworlds version
21:59 < rand> you may ask pelya on github https://github.com/pelya/commandergenius/tree/sdl_android/project/jni/application/teeworlds (with an issue)
22:00 < rand> * https://github.com/pelya/teeworlds
22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I think I have read somewhere that therw on't be an android update to 0.7-
22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> won't
22:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but might as well try first
22:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @redix you here?
22:20 < CrisGallar2> bye
