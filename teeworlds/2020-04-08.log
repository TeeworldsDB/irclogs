11:04 < ChillerDragun> any opinions on putting the sha256 in the demo header?
11:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> What's the use?
11:29 < ChillerDragun> Would come in handy for demo slicing

12:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> wavi: getting the same crash with dbg_dummies 4;reload on a trunk server
12:35 < wavi> what's debug_dummies 4?
12:36 < Dune> dbg_dummies is a server config that you can use to spawn dummies
13:19 < wavi> wow, gotta try that out...
13:23 < wavi> how does it work?
13:29 < rand> atm, it doesn't work well because of some recent commit, technically, the server adds fake player (without client) giving them harcoded input (left or right)
13:30 < rand> it only works on a debug build
13:31 < rand> (it is disabled on release)
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @Dune that one dbg assert causes so many crashes :D
13:35 < wavi> ah, ok
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I wonder, if it would be a good idea to get the same nickname highlight with server messagee as with chat messages
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> if the message contains your nickname
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @fokkonaut that was one was introduced after 0.7.4
17:10 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> hello! i've read on the teeworlds contact page that this is a place for chatting about support
17:13 <@heinrich5991> it is
17:13 <@heinrich5991> hi!
17:14 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> i use lubuntu 18.04 (made from ubuntu 18.04) on an old 32bit pc; the game worked fine until some months ago; but now the game crashes and exits constantly, after arbitrary amounts of time after firing up the game; if i build the game from github and fire it from the terminal with ./teeworlds, when it crashes, i get "intel_do_flush_locked failed: No space left on device" in the terminal
17:16 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> the crashing happens on all the versions i tried, including the flatpak and the archive downloaded from teeworlds.com; the unofficial snap is only for 64 bit unfortunately
17:18 <@heinrich5991> does it say more than that in the terminal?
17:18 <@heinrich5991> maybe "Segmentation Fault" or so?
17:21 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> nope; i only get some "failed" messages: "[2020-04-08 18:01:40][storage]: couldn't open storage.cfg" or "[2020-04-08 18:01:40][console]: failed to open 'autoexec.cfg'"
17:22 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> other than that - only general info: bounding keys, getting data etc
17:24 <@heinrich5991> how does the game exit? the window just disappears and the console prompt appears again?
17:25 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> the window disappears, the terminal with the prompt is always there
17:25 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> in the background i mean
17:26 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> it appears the crashing occurs much faster on certain modded maps
17:26 <@heinrich5991> when you run the game (`./teeworlds`), then the prompt disappears until teeworlds exits, right?
17:26 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> it disappears in the sense that the teeworlds window covers it
17:27 <@heinrich5991> ah well
17:27 <@heinrich5991> I mean normally there's a prompt like `user@host directory$ ./teeworlds`
17:27 <@heinrich5991> anyway, googling around the internet a bit, https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?t=59040, similar issues for arch linux, ubuntu and fedora, suggests that there is an issue with a driver of your graphics card (returns an ENOSPC error when there are too many textures)
17:28 <@heinrich5991> I don't really know what the best course of action here is. maybe teeworlds leaks textures(?) could you try running teeworlds in a debugger?
17:28 <@heinrich5991> with your self-compiled ./teeworlds version, try running `gdb ./teeworlds`, and then enter `run` in the prompt
17:29 <@heinrich5991> after it crashes, enter `bt` in the prompt and tell us the output
17:31 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> will do, thanks
17:36 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> i ran gdb ./teeworlds and then i ran run; it doesn't even show the window now; i see some errors in the terminal, where do i list them?

17:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> does it run without the debugger?
17:40 <@heinrich5991> did you switch users in some way? ("XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not owned by us [...]" suggests that.)
17:41 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> ups, i switched to the admin account; lemme try with the normal one
17:44 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> now it runs; i will play with it until it crashes
17:50 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> here it is https://paste.mozilla.org/mjTQVpA5
17:54 <@heinrich5991> okay, that is tricky :(
17:54 <@heinrich5991> as you observed, there's no crash
17:55 <@heinrich5991> I'm honestly not sure how to further debug this
17:55 <@heinrich5991> do you happen to play other games, too? does the issue occur there as well?
17:57 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> i haven't tried with other games
17:57 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> i tried minetest today (a minecraft copy); it runs slow, but it didn't crash
18:00 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> but what is really weird is that it worked flawlessly till some months ago
18:00 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> when i tried to play both the 0.6etc version from the ubuntu software store and the git 0.7etc version
18:01 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> that's when it started to get weird and crash; lubuntu was reinstalled at least one since then, but the issue is still present
18:04 <@heinrich5991> I don't have a clue :(
18:04 <@heinrich5991> it might be a driver update that caused it
18:05 <@heinrich5991> unless someone else from this channel can help, I'm out of ideas, sorry :(
18:10 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> i understand
18:10 < Rares__FoXi_Tee> thank you for the help
21:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> it crashes but it doesn't crash?
