16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> I have released a new version of my python module twmap. Its now at version 0.2.0. you can now modify every part of the map and create new maps from within python with the new constructors
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> Its once again available on pypi, so you can install it with `pip install twmap` and upgrade it with `pip install twmap --upgrade`, **also on windows now!**
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> To figure out how to use the module, import it and use `help(twmap)` and then help on the structs you retrieve. Note that on windows `help(twmap)` won't show you the documentation of the main struct, `Map`. so on windows you might have to start with `help(twmap.Map)`. load your first map by doing `map = twmap.Map("path/to/map")`
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> If you find any bugs or things the module should have, you can write me or better yet: create an issue here https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap-py/-/issues
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> If you want to contribute to it, be warned: the code is mostly undocumented and a bit complicated, but I will happily help you understand the code if you have questions
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> @Essigautomat map editing/creation is here now :)
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> uses fancy rust magic under the hood for implementing a python module :'0
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> NICE
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> As soon as I have some time i will give you feedback
22:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> so maybe next year ðŸ˜¦
