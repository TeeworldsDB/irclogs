01:42 < Stitch626> I made a little tool to request the tw server list. There is also a fuction to sort it by master server (for debugging purposes). I've seen very interesting things. Right now the masterservers are a bit buggy/attacked. On master 3 are only teecloud servers, nothing else. On master 4 is almost only ddnet, there are just a few other servers. This sounds like whitelisting.... Isnt that a bad thing?  minus heinrich5991 matricks
