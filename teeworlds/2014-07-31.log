21:16 < EastByte> matricks: are you there?
21:18 <@matricks> nope
21:19 < EastByte> ah
21:19 <@matricks> :)
21:19 <@matricks> wzp?
21:20 < EastByte> https://eastbit.net/priv/31_Jul-14-13_35.png
21:20 < EastByte> trying to switch to gamepad :P
21:20 <@matricks> heh
21:21 < EastByte> and I have a question related to the tw protocol
21:21 <@matricks> sshoot
21:21 < EastByte> how far can a user go using a spoofed ip?
21:21 < EastByte> connect? sending messages ingame?
21:21 <@matricks> not at all I think
21:22 < EastByte> because there seem to be problems like this
21:22 <@matricks> could be that they can allocate a slot or something, dunno
21:22 < EastByte> yes that's possible
21:23 < EastByte> and now someone told me it's possible to go further e.g. sending disconnect messages
21:23 < EastByte> to kick specific players
21:24 <@matricks> some hole in the protocol then
21:24 < EastByte> it works like tcp I think?
21:24 <@matricks> the TW protocol? no
21:24 < EastByte> ack/seq
21:25 <@matricks> there are similarities, but they are quite different
21:25 < EastByte> okay
21:25 <@matricks> tw protocol is chunk based, has optional reliability
21:25 <@matricks> tcp is stream-based
21:27 < EastByte> but it shouldn't be possible as an attacker to join the session
21:28 < EastByte> well I'm actually too lazy to dive in it
21:29 < EastByte> into*
21:30 <@matricks> shouldn't.. but could be possible, havn't looked over that code in so long
