00:29 < bridge> <jxsl13> tried to repack my 210GB tar.gz into 1GB sized tar.zst (600~700MB compressed) which in total added up slightly above the 210GB again :'/
00:37 < bridge> <jxsl13> gotta dive deeper into (gnu) tar's flags for compressing zstd...
00:43 < bridge> <jxsl13> any recommended compression level, 3 being the default, 22 being max?
01:33 < minus> you don't really need to have tar(1) do the compression, it's independet anyway. just gzip -d < tar.gz | zstd > tar.zst
