00:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well, restarted the server and it works again? lets see how long...
00:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ok
00:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it doesnt work anymore
00:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it seems like it breaks 0.7 master connection when someone enters, logins to rcon and disconnects before all commands got sent
00:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> funny enough it doesnt break the 0.6 register
00:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> have you tried it with a vanilla server?
00:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> first info is "master is not responding"
00:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i dont have one
00:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and i cannot set one up
00:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but i also have wwwwwway more rcon cmds
00:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon can you try setting up a vanilla server?
00:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> on that host
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> he deleted his discord
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> nice
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> got any contact data?
00:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes, but he hasits phone shut down it seems
00:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> his*
00:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> is he fine?
00:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes he is, just contacted him today
00:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> okay ðŸ™‚
00:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i dont understand thisss
00:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> how can this even fuck up registering?!
00:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't know, I don't understand it either
00:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> can you set up a server?
00:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> for testing
00:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I gave you a user on my vps last time, I think you successfully set up the server there, last time
00:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> look, may I change the order, so it first does the registering stuff each tick, then sends all the commands?
00:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/F-DDrace/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L1814-L1830
00:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> because i have very many rcon commands: https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/blob/F-DDrace/src/game/ddracecommands.h
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> order there shouldn'tâ„¢ affect it
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> shouldnt xd
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i will give it a try
00:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea didnt work xd
00:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> man i am pissed
10:05 < ChillerDragon> heinrich5991 im on wire and here on irc
10:06 < ChillerDragon> my vanilla server works fine
10:18 < ChillerDragon> my 0.7.5 server doesnt run on master tho I think I used some stable commit. I rebuild a new vanilla server from master in release mode looks good to me.
10:18 < ChillerDragon> zillyhuhn.com:7304 "ChillerDragon master test"
12:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/704997282352726037/unknown.png
12:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> on the test F-DDrace server now
12:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: can you rehost @fokkonaut's server on 7304 and try vanilla on 7303?
12:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> my server is on 7303, i have a testsrv running on 7305, same effect. Vanilla one is running on 7304
12:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah
12:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> its just my mod
12:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but only your mod on ChillerDragon's server?
12:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
12:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i dont get it
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> next up, try asking ChillerDragon for a packet capture and reproduce the bug while it is running
12:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> then you can analyse it in wireshark
12:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that'll allow you to figure out whether your server isn't sending the master packets anymore, or isn't receiving them anymore
12:55 < rand> btw, your server is register on 0.6 masterservers but send server_info packet for 0.7 clients
12:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no?
12:55 < rand> or some mix of both
12:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it sends 0.6 packets
12:57 < rand> what are the numbers between the mapname and gametype ?
12:57 < rand> I may miss something
12:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i send the extended protocol from ddnet only, i dont support 0.6 vanilla clients
12:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i only support ddnet based client, because they have tokens
12:58 < rand> ok
14:48 < rand> fokkonaut: what are the steps to reproduce ? I note : start the server (everything is fine), login in rcon, disconnect right away. That's it ?
14:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (also be on ChillerDragon's vps while doing these steps, apparently)
14:56 < rand> Im' not fast enough to quit before the chat command are sent ><
15:05 < rand> (and try with a local master server maybe)
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @rand, just login to rcon
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nothing more appearantly
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But it seems like it only happens on Chillerdragons VPS
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and only with F-DDrace
17:43 < rand> ><
17:43 < rand> it's time for some tcpdump :x
17:44 < rand> I have just updated my disector to show master server <-> server packets 
18:35 < ChillerDragon> nice rand!
