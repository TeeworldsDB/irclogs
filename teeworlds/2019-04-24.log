09:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> From the server? Yeah
17:18 < rand> about dummies, either remove dummies when a player need a slot or make the engine know about dummies... what sounds the best ?
17:19 < rand> (my bot mod does both)
17:19 < rand> (dummies could be a dummy bot AI and be made that way)
17:43 < rand> what is the difference between PredictedInput and DirectInput ?
18:17 < Dune> rand: you need to rebase with the latest commit for CI to work
18:19 < rand> pfff
18:29 < Dune> rand: my server crashes when I do ./teeworlds_srv "dbg_dummies 30"
18:29 < Dune> (on your branch)
18:32 < Dune> [5cc08f51][assert]: src/game/server/gamecontext.cpp(675): invalid clientID
18:35 < rand> well, that's somewhat an improvment
18:35 < Dune> yeah
18:37 < dune_test> test
18:39 < rand> I add clamp for dbg_dummies :)
18:48 < Dune> works :)
18:55 < rand> note that dummies can't be seen as spectators in scoreboard
18:55 < rand> i think I will make another solution with server engine 
18:58 < Dune> oh, right
18:58 < Dune> dummies are just a quick hack :p
19:01 < rand> dummies could become dummy AIs
19:09 < Dune> minus: I think you set a ban range for external messages to this chan, correct? since #teeworlds is not +n
19:28 < minus> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
