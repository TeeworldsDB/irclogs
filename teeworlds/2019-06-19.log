17:34 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <＃6909> That would be nice, i vote for removing masters
19:02 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> aren't the master servers only used for serverlists? The only thing i can think of is Blockchain for a shared server list
19:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> without masterservers
19:03 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> That would be an overkill af
19:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> imo masters are pretty nice and lets hope they are more stable in 0.7 😃
19:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> never had an issue in 0.7
19:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> atm
19:38 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> i wonder how you can protect them against dos attacks
20:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Slayer *gV*> You probably could realize this via the steam network. But I guess that dependency would be a gamestopper.
20:31 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> @𝓔𝓼𝓼𝓲𝓰𝓪𝓾𝓽𝓸𝓶𝓪𝓽 the issue in 0.6 is that there is a fault that lets you do reflection attacks, and that can't be completely patched without a protocol change
22:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> how does the steam network work? I bet it has centralized servers, too
22:43 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> I just wrote bullshit
