15:05 < DoNe> hi, i have a pobleme while coding a mod, and i thought maybe i can get help here
15:07 < DoNe> instead of killing a player i want to make him spectator, i use the "SetTeam" function but it kills the character before the function that executed "SetTeam" inside of the character isnt over already.
15:08 < DoNe> so it crashes
15:08 < DoNe> i wanted to know if some1 had a similar problem and maybe a good solution
15:09 < laxadedi> solution : watch zcatch code
