00:58 < pinkieval> I just realized that what I described is actually how the security token works, but with sha1 instead of md5

17:29 < bridge> [steam] <heinrich5991> \o/ steam chat bridge works :P
17:31 < bridge> [freenode] <heinrich5991> freenode as well
17:37 <@heinrich5991> not that anyone would actually join the steam chat ^^
19:13 < pinkieval> any thoughts on this? https://github.com/necropotame/teeworlds-infclass/pull/212
19:14 < pinkieval> this is to prevent the current kind of DoS I'm getting, with many (apparently uniformly distributed) IP addresses filling all client slots
19:27 <@heinrich5991> "any thoughts?" you should configure your editor in some way, the whitespace in this diff is messed up ^^
19:28 < pinkieval> infclass is already messed up
19:29 <@heinrich5991> don't make the problem worse ^^
19:31 < pinkieval> heinrich5991: fixed

19:31 <@heinrich5991> look at the diff :D https://github.com/necropotame/teeworlds-infclass/pull/212/files
19:33 < pinkieval> oops, forgot the .h
19:33 < pinkieval> done
19:33 < pinkieval> wait what
19:33 < pinkieval> done
19:35 <@heinrich5991> pinkieval: I don't see the code parsing security tokens
19:35 <@heinrich5991> mh
19:36 < pinkieval> heinrich5991: https://github.com/necropotame/teeworlds-infclass/pull/212/files#diff-a60948952f625787eb8b3cf54f82d047R229
19:36 < pinkieval> it reuses the SecurityToken variable
19:37 <@heinrich5991> if the security token is invalid, you can just drop the connection immediately
19:37 < pinkieval> isn't that what I do?
19:37 <@heinrich5991> no, you only drop it when the server "is under attack"
19:38 < pinkieval> oh, right, I could check if it is equal to NET_SECURITY_TOKEN_UNSUPPORTED
19:39 < pinkieval> thx
