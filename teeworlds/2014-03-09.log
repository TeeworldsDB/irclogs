00:07 < MertenNor> fisted: meh.. xD
00:07 < fisted> why meh?
00:08 <@minus> MertenNor: it's kinda/kind of btw

00:21 < BotoX> amazing
00:35 < noneofmynickswo> howls moving castle
00:35 < noneofmynickswo> darn you all, now i gotta watch it
00:36 <@matricks> hehe
00:36 <@matricks> I got the urge to watch full metal panic
00:38 <@minus> FMP, been a while
00:39 < MertenNor> any program that you guys know of that I can replace the audio track from a movie to a different one ?
00:39 <@matricks> any demux/mux program
00:39 <@matricks> avidemux for example
00:39 <@matricks> ffmpeg
00:39 <@matricks> mencoder
00:39 <@minus> MertenNor: mkvextract can split mkvs, every decent player can use external audio files
00:40 <@minus> sleepy time
00:40 < MertenNor> ah ok Thanks minus 
00:40 <@minus> there's even a gui for it
00:40 <@minus> cya
01:11 < Learath2> my god these games so expensive with this stupid financial crisis going on
01:11 < Learath2> i think ill just play teeworlds
01:21 < noneofmynickswo> emulators, lots and lots of games :)
01:22 < Learath2> already finished alot of the classics on the actual consoles
01:22 < noneofmynickswo> really?
01:22 < noneofmynickswo> i'm gonna mention some games then
01:22 < noneofmynickswo> brave fencer musashiden ?
01:25 < noneofmynickswo> there's always a hidden gem around
01:30 < Learath2> thats one i havent played yet
01:30 < Learath2> must try
02:17 < noneofmynickswo> its awesome, i played it when i was really young. right now i feel like barfing when i play it. because i've played it so much. its one of those games where i wish i could experience it again like the first time
11:22 < MertenNor> minus: do you remember what the program was called again ?
11:22 <@minus> "the" program, MertenNor?
11:22 < MertenNor> the one that let me change the audio in a movie.. 
11:22 <@minus> mkvextract
11:22 <@minus> lets you extract all tracks of an mkv file
11:23 < MertenNor> yeah Thanks
12:52 < MertenNor-iphon> Test
13:27 < CuBe_> matricks: at work ?
13:27 <@matricks> yeah
13:27 < CuBe_> matricks: you work the whole week ?
13:27 <@matricks> yeah
13:28 < CuBe_> you work at home probably
13:28 < CuBe_> "yeah"
13:28 < CuBe_> :p
13:29 <@matricks> no, I'm at work
13:37 <@minus> i see you've got a release coming
13:38 <@matricks> ya

13:38 <@matricks> weird shit...
13:39 <@minus> Mill CPU?
13:40 <@matricks> yeah
13:40 <@minus> what's that
13:40 <@minus> oh, it's in the talk
14:05 < JulianAssange> BotoX: http://i.imgur.com/IOQlVJD.jpg
18:40 < CuBe_> matricks: suppose I want to make a small multiplayer game. would C++ be the best language or could I just aswell write it in java ?
18:42 <@matricks> if it's small, it doesn't matter, but I dislike java for games
18:43 < CuBe_> so the best option is C++
18:43 <@matricks> I would say yes
18:43 < CuBe_> what about python ?
18:43 <@matricks> same story as java more or less
18:43 < CuBe_> mkay 
18:43 <@matricks> as long as it's small it doesn't really matter
18:43 <@matricks> the CPU power of todays machines will compensate
18:44 < CuBe_> yeah, but maybe to make it multiplayer & making people connect to server one may be easier than the other
19:23 < Edible> why does teeworlds take so long to download any map?
19:23 < yemDX> it adds to the experience
19:23 <@matricks> it throttles the download to at maximum 10 packets in flight at any time
19:24 < Edible> mmm i kind of understand that. thanks matricks 
19:25 <@matricks> would be bad if a client soaks up all BW from a server
19:25 < Edible> you wouldnt want to increase that i imagine?
19:25 < yemDX> tw maps need to be small anyway
19:25 <@matricks> what yemDX said
19:26 < BotoX> it's already increased in 0.7, isn't it?
19:26 < yemDX> i hate download big-ass maps when they're just retarded-looking custom tilesets anyway
19:26 < yemDX> i.e. 99% of custom tilesets
19:26 < BotoX> ressys
19:26 <@matricks> ressys doesn't have anything todo with 0.7
19:27 < BotoX> ik
19:27 < BotoX> but that'd fix yemDX's problem
19:27 <@matricks> ya
19:27 < CuBe_> matricks
19:27 < CuBe_> nooby question ( again :p )
19:28 < Edible> if its about linux better ask on a distro channel
19:28 < CuBe_> in teeworlds, all data like images etc is in a map data
19:28 < CuBe_> but in visual studio I should put it in resource files
19:28 < CuBe_> no ? :p
19:29 <@matricks> no...
19:29 < CuBe_> I mean
19:29 <@matricks> everything you said was warong
19:29 < CuBe_> ugh ^^
19:30 <@matricks> not everything is in the map files
19:30 < Edible> CuBe_, whats a resource file?
19:30 <@matricks> and resource files under windows is more or less totalt crap
19:30 <@matricks> Edible: old legacy windows crap
19:30 < CuBe_> a file with my resource? images
19:30 < CuBe_> etc
19:30 < CuBe_> etc
19:30 <@matricks> CuBe_: resource files, only use them if you are going todo some sort of application, not games etc
19:31 < CuBe_> oh
19:31 < CuBe_> so where should I put my images then
19:31 < CuBe_> Source Files?
19:31 <@minus> data folder?
19:31 < CuBe_> should I create a data folder in my Source files?
19:32 <@minus> what are you even doing?
19:32 <@minus> making a game?
19:32 < CuBe_> ye I already have the code from when I made it in javascript
19:32 < CuBe_> but now I want to do it in C++
19:32  * minus giggles
19:32 < CuBe_> fu :p
19:32 < CuBe_> I'm not the expert ^^
19:32 <@minus> yeah, a folder for assets sounds good
19:33 <@minus> for releases you can do it like quake n shit and pack it into zips and mount those as virtual file systems inside the game
19:33 <@matricks> minus: don't confuse him
19:33 < CuBe_> how I understand everything much better now minus, thx
19:34  * minus shrugs and goes read mangos
19:34  * matricks continues to work
19:34 < yemDX> um minus... you can't read a mango
19:34 <@minus> matricks: sleeping at work too?
19:35 < yemDX> i think you may need to get some help
19:35 <@matricks> minus: no, I do that at home
19:35 <@minus> some people read fortunes from tea, why can't i read mangos?
19:35 <@matricks> has to be over 10 years ago I slept at the office
19:35 <@minus> how far is it?
19:36 <@matricks> 10 minutes with bike
19:36 <@minus> short enough
19:56 < Learath2> CuBe_: one advice
19:56 < Learath2> dont use visual studio
19:56 < Learath2> even if you are going to use windows
19:57 < CuBe_> yeah
19:57 < CuBe_> bear told me how to do that,but so stupid that they teach us only how to use the programs in school
19:57 < CuBe_> I don't know shit about compiling on my own etc ._.
19:57 < CuBe_> @ Learath2
19:57 < Learath2> CuBe_: uhmmm
19:58 < Learath2> use visual studio command line
19:58 < Learath2> its just a simple command
19:58 < CuBe_> I don't need to make a makefile etc?
19:59 <@minus> g++ -g -O0 *.cpp -o my_game ‚Üê not so hard
19:59 < Learath2> you can get a fancy makefile if you feel like you need one
19:59 < Learath2> i use MinGW on windows
20:01 < BotoX> >-O0
20:01 <@minus> ^ -g
20:01 < BotoX> ah
20:01 < BotoX> debugging, I see
20:01 < BotoX> >not debugging with -O3
20:01 < BotoX> got unroll dem loops
20:01 <@minus> wouldn't wanna encounter a segfault without -g
20:01 < BotoX> http://funroll-loops.info/
20:02 <@minus> when compiling ELF DSOs use -fvisibility=hidden and __attribute__((visibility("default")))
20:03 < BotoX> y-yeah
20:03 <@minus> 'cause by default all functions are exported. opposite of windows
20:26 <@matricks> jolly, I have one of those really really fun bugs to solve
20:27 <@minus> what's wrong, matricks?
20:27 <@matricks> textures are missing if I enable LTCG
20:27 <@matricks> some textures...
20:27 <@minus> LTCG?
20:28 <@matricks> link time code generation
20:28 <@minus> Oo
20:29 <@matricks> heavy optimizations
20:32 <@matricks> and that brakes something...
20:36 <@matricks> gonan be fun to find that one :/
21:36  * CuBe_ slaps Learath2 around a bit with a large fishbot
22:13 <@minus> no slapping!
22:57 < CuBe_> have a good night
22:57  * CuBe_ slaps minus around a bit with a large fishbot
23:04 < Sonix> lol
