12:45 <@Dune> I don't understand the issue with https://www.transifex.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/translate/#de/$/164088665?q=issue%3Aopen
12:45 <@Dune> Any german speaker knows why "All players were moved to the %s" is troublesome to translate?
12:45 < day> nein nein nein
12:46 <@Dune> I see you are fluent, day
12:46 < day> ofc im fluent
12:47 < day> what is %s substituted with?
12:47 <@Dune> Team Rot/Team Blau/Zuschauer 
12:48 < day> It is indeed a bit tricky :|
12:49 < day> Alle Spieler wurden ins Team Rot/Blue transferiert.
12:49 < day> i dont like "transferiert" though it sounds a bit odd..
12:50 < day> the spectators are the main issue
12:50 <@Dune> hm, just realized it's not great in french either
12:51 <@Dune> any code change that would help?
12:51 <@Dune> encompass [the] in the %s?
12:51 < day> how would you write the sentence for hte spectators in french?
12:53 <@Dune> Tous les joueurs ont été déplacés dans les spectateurs
12:53 <@Dune> in fact, the sentence isn't much an issue, having to translate the for "spectators" (plural) and "red team" (single) is the issue here
12:53 < day> yeah
12:54 < day> All players were benched. :P
12:56 <@heinrich5991> the translatable messages should really be "All players were moved to the red team", "All players were moved to the blue team", "All players were moved to the spectators"
12:56 <@heinrich5991> then we don't get these problems
12:56 <@heinrich5991> (even if it makes programmers cringe a little to see that kind of duplication :P)
12:56 <@Dune> yeah exactly :c
12:58 < day> what i dont like about "moved to spectators" is, for that sentence to be true there need to be spectators in the first place
12:58 < day> were moved to the spectator seats on the other hand
12:59 < day> sounds bad :P
12:59 < day> anyhow if i translate it as plainly as possible i would do:
12:59 < day> Alle Spieler wurden ins rote Team verschoben
12:59 < day> Alle Spieler wurden zu den Zuschauern verschoben
13:01 <@Dune> we should add Python as a transifex language. "for p in players: p.team = -1"
13:01 <@Dune> human languages suck
13:04 < TeeSlayer> the crash bug still happens, not just for target id -1, but invalid ids in general
13:05 <@Dune> what crash bug, TeeSlayer?
13:05 < TeeSlayer> It was supposed to be solved with https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2002
13:05 < TeeSlayer> But I found it on https://github.com/sirius1242/teeworlds-solofng/issues/1 again
13:09 < TeeSlayer> Connect to L#20 with the patch and see for yourself
13:26 < day> a player/chat mute function would be nice btw
13:37 <@Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2043
13:38 <@Dune> there is already one
13:58 < day> oh nice
13:58 < day> i hate these trash players that keep spam abusing the chat.
13:58 < day> putin being the worst
14:08 <@Dune> I mean, it's in 0.7.2, in Settings > Players
14:08 < TeeSlayer> didn't the old teeworlds had a server mute for this kind of spam?
14:09 <@Dune> since 0.6 or so, yeah?
14:11 < TeeSlayer> in 0.7 you can spam the same string countless times. the antispam only makes it slower
14:11 <@Dune> the spam protection got a bit more gentle
14:14 < rand> Dune: s/dans les spectateurs/vers les spectateurs/
14:14 < rand> human language is highly ambiguous 
14:15 < rand> except some
14:15 < rand> maybe esperanto and lobjan
14:17 < day> i dont like how ambiguous "we" is, when you are in a group and talking about something 
14:18 <@heinrich5991> TeeSlayer: no, that's just ddnet
14:20 <@Dune> rand: windows says déplacer dans la corbeille or déplacer vers la corbeille for move to the trash?
14:25 < rand> trash is a place, spectator is a status
14:25  * rand tries to find a valid reason
14:31 < TeeSlayer> heinrich5991: ah
14:44 <@heinrich5991> Dune: day: look at that code duplication :P https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2068
14:45 <@Dune> ouch haha
14:46 <@Dune> why have you switched to bracket-style for one-line ifs in recent PRs, heinrich5991?
14:50 <@Dune> it's an otherwise elegant approach to the problem :)
14:51 <@Dune> will need translators to update though, transifex won't update it automatically
14:54 <@Dune> rand: I think the crash occurs with IDs such as -3?
14:55 <@Dune> heinrich5991: I wonder if you could avoid the code duplication with Localize("the player has joined the" STR_RED_TEAM)
14:56 <@Dune> ah, but GetStrTeam is not a macro, so that doesn't work, nvm
16:54 <@Dune> Shouldn't the Teeworlds filter also force "Standard map" checked?
16:55 <@Dune> Isn't it supposed to be some sort of assurance not to stumble on a map full of male organs (although I haven't seen any)?
16:56 <@Dune> looks a bit weird to lock gametype only, visually. Maybe just swap the two in the filter bar then
16:57 < rand> Dune: no, IDs are clamped
16:57 <@Dune> huh
16:57 < rand> they should at least
16:58 <@Dune> well, https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2002 
16:59 <@Dune> I don't know what ID TeeSlayer used
16:59 < rand> I should ask for a full backtrace
17:00 < rand> but I didn't know about those some weeks ago
17:00  * Dune doesn't know about those
17:00 < rand> backtrace full (print the value of local vars)
17:00 < rand> (but it can be a bad idea)
17:00 < rand> (I made gdb segfault while asking for it once xD)
17:01 <@Dune> you should provide the gdb team with a backtrace then :P
17:03 < rand> i bet the second layer would crash
17:04 < rand> I'll dig it later, it looks easy to reproduce
17:23 < day> rand: did you play as #1 recently?
17:28 < rand> no, did sby mimic my awesome moves ?
17:34 < rand> usually, my nicknames end with “()”
17:51 < TeeSlayer> rand: https://lolinet.info/download/full_backtrace.txt
17:52 < Oy> Dune: not sure if standard map should be forced too. custom maps provide standard gameplay too, but yeah these maps could have some bad images
17:55 < TeeSlayer> rand: you can reproduce it if you follow the steps on the other issue (visit L#20)
17:56 < rand> TeeSlayer: thank you ♥
17:58 < rand> ok, so that's a server message 
17:58 < rand> grmbl, malicious server ! x)
17:58 < TeeSlayer> yeah, it is
18:07 < day> rand: i want to know who that was D: his movements were quite good. aim mediocre. he kept spamming emotes and his ping was 21ish
18:07 < day> at first i thought mario. but he has a slighly higher ping and i wouldnt have beat him :P
18:09 < TeeSlayer> why do people play multimap all day
18:13 < TeeSlayer> 758 people have completed it since I ported the map two months ago
18:13 < day> is that a racemap?
18:13 < TeeSlayer> ddrace
18:13 < day> haha
18:14 < day> we should round up all ddrace players and...
18:14 < day> nvm :#
18:15  * day has no teeworlds friends thus has to hate the mod!
18:15 <@Dune> tees are already round
18:15 < TeeSlayer> day: I'm also hosting 3 blocker servers
18:15 < TeeSlayer> however, they're not very popular :(
18:15 < day> host an ifb server :3
18:15 < day> best mod ever. brought me into tw 10years ago :D
18:16 < TeeSlayer> I even ported blmapV3ROYAL with pretty much all features (including arenas)
18:16 < rand> day: well, looks like me, specially the aim 
18:16 < TeeSlayer> ifb?
18:16 < TeeSlayer> what's that again?
18:16 < TeeSlayer> football?
18:16 < day> one flag. and you have to dunk it into the enemy base
18:16 < day> but its played on basically ctf maps
18:17 < day> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JagwWeFEJjw&t=4s
18:17 <@Dune> ahhh, flagball
18:17 < day> that was the most famous map i think
18:17 < day> <3
18:17 <@Dune> 0.4 desert tileset :(
18:17 < day> you remember [SCH]Eis Dune?
18:17 < day> he/she is the one in that video :D
18:18 <@Dune> no but I remember Tee Killa :D
18:18 < day> and probably jini?
18:18 <@Dune> and I remember being killed non stop on this map and hating it :<
18:19 < day> haha
18:19 < day> yeah the learning curve was brutal. everyone who played it was god tier when i started playing
18:20 <@Dune> people don't do pvp mods anymore :(
18:22 < day> scoring in that mod was soooo satisfying
19:32 < Oy> flagball was nice :)
20:34 < day> rand: nah you dont emote spam
21:06 < rand> only love and happiness
21:06 < rand> bound to mousewheel :3
21:17 < rand> grmbl, wth, i didn't get that try suicide makes another client segfault…
21:23 < rand> still, the server is wrong at some point
21:25 < rand> the server broadcast a client specific message, the second client shouldn't get the message about suicide
21:28 < rand> do we agree about the server not sending whisper messages ? (ClientID==-1)
21:32 <@Dune> the server can use server messages for that...
21:59 < rand> I added more tests for CHAT_WHISPER
22:13 <@Dune> rand, thank god you split that if
22:20 < TeeSlayer> my favorite if statements in the entire teeworlds space: https://lolinet.info/download/ddnet_ifs.png 
22:22 <@Dune> I never doubted mods can top that :P
22:29 < minus> i sure hope that's generated code
22:37 <@Dune> that's optimistic
22:41 < TeeSlayer> Dune: Your PR regarding autocompletion of commands doesn't take mods into consideration, right?
22:42 <@Dune> it's client-side only
22:42 <@Dune> for client commands
22:42 < TeeSlayer> Like there could be a few collisions
22:42 < TeeSlayer> /r and /team for example are commonly used in ddrace
22:42 <@Dune> I know, you can cancel any command and send it as plain text
22:42 <@Dune> just press Esc
22:43 <@Dune> also, binds are not affected
22:44 < TeeSlayer> how about giving the server the option to modify s_aapCommands? it's all dependent on the server anyway whether those commands are allowed (except mute)
22:45 <@Dune> That is a possible extension
22:45 <@Dune> I set the bases, feel free to extend it
22:46 <@Dune> This makes whisper target selection more intuitive, chat mutes much faster (hello putin), and makes the tab behavior more consistent overall. It's already a big enough PR as it is :)
22:49 < rand> someone suggested protocol/feature negociation
22:50 < rand> (and teeuniverse implements this but was not followed) 
23:08 < day> sometimes i wonder if teeworlds internally uses slopes
23:08 < day> for edges
23:08 < day> corners*
23:09 < day> like sometimes you are slighly to low to fly onto the plateau, and you just barely hit the edge. this causes the tee to slow down almost to a standstil, but not toally it will slighly glitch upwards and keep moving onto the platform but the velocity is reduced to 'walking' speed
23:11 <@Dune> slopes are only available after you enter god mode
23:11 <@Dune> you must have accidentally pressed the shortcut
23:11 < day> my god. the randoms are right after all
23:11 < day> i AM cheating q.q
23:13 <@heinrich5991> day: you can find the relevant line in the source by grepping for 'this is a real _corner case_!'
23:14 < day> heinrich5991: just add a 'jk we count it as didnt hit the corner :^)'
23:26 < day> heinrich5991: what is Elasticity?
23:26 <@heinrich5991> that's for the flag
23:28 < day> but it's multiplied with the Vel.x and Vel.y
23:28 <@heinrich5991> so it jumps up again after hitting the wall
23:28 < day> which im assuming is the tee speed in x/y
23:28 < day> ah
23:28 < day> so im guessing im looking at the wrong collision thing
23:28 <@heinrich5991> minus: it's not
23:30 < day> my god that if statement *.*. When mom calls for lunch and you want to finish the section :P
