11:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I am actually very happy with the 0.7 client
11:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> when i moved away from 0.6 and started almost only playing 0.7 i disliked it but now its nice
11:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> i dont see how ddnet destroyed 0.6, it simply got popular, if ppl enjoy playing it i dont see anything wrong, make your awesome mod and im sure ppl will play it if its good
11:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Ryozuki> you could start by investigating why its so popular
11:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I am not able to download maps in 0.7 :/ in 0.6 it works tho
11:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> it gets stuck after a few bytes
11:38 < rand> @fokkonaut : does your code about tee collisions can be simplified as if(D < PhysSize && D >= 0.f) ?
11:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Thats what I thought too last night while reviewing my commits xd
11:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> But
11:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I think i tried it and it didnt work iirc
11:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I can try again later
11:40 < rand> ok
11:41 < rand> ‚Äú<zcatch> this is a beginner server, you are not allowed to play here‚Äù :( I'm a forever beginner !
15:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @oy thanks for merging the spec mouse pr! did you test everything?
15:37 < Oy> yeah, think so
15:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> nice
16:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> one day i will bring code a new client with all the features iam missing, with matchmaking, twitch support and hookers
16:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> hyped
16:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i think i need help with the github actions workflows
16:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> on my current state windows with bam and mac with cmake are not running
16:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> there was a mac fix recently I think
16:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I have a new branch (actions2) so i don't spam the tw PR
16:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> can you further explain?
16:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I have a working gh actions workflow for all 3 platforms with bam and cmake. Only the packaging is not working on mac. According to cmake the needed tools are missing. Anybody ever tried building dmg files on Travis or gh actions?
17:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> And the sdl+freetype download often fails with bam on windows
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> can you send me a link to lookup what you did differently?
17:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/axblk/teeworlds/commits/gh_actions
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @redix https://travis-ci.org/ddnet/ddnet/jobs/632954311#L754
17:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Cool stuff @redix
17:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Gh actions has no pkg-config by default. And the findsdl module from tw is buggy when pkg config is missing
17:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> on which os?
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The windows thing is probably due to gh actions using Powershell as default shell
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> and in what way buggy?
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> how do i change that @redix because iam sure you are right
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> shell: bash
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> okay, will test
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> You can't. Add python as prefix in the bam script
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/axblk/teeworlds/commit/0466d77988102ed4e8a309317cac5ed022b6df3f
17:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The change in bam.lua
17:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that might break builds on normal windows
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @heinrich5991 when the cmake internal fing_package is used pkg-config is still called
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> big note here:
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/actions/setup-python
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i already tried this (without success)
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> It might overwrite the valid paths when pkg-config can't find sdl
17:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The problem is the file type association on windows. It will internally start a new shell so you can't pipe the output
17:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but the build worked on my system with this bam.lua version, I think
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> It's only a problem when Powershell is used by default. I think that's not the case on usual windows systems
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah
17:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I don't see where pkg-config is used on windows (has a default of `PREFER_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON`) other than a source of hints for `find_library`
17:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> That problem occured on mac. find_package already found sdl but since pkg-config was missing it still did not work
17:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/axblk/teeworlds/commit/09466c7695068b090d64fd53896f8dd5fc8cb299
17:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's not a problem of pkg-config
17:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but of the second `find_library` call
17:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/axblk/teeworlds/commit/09466c7695068b090d64fd53896f8dd5fc8cb299?w=1
17:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> True
17:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> here is my latest workflow where you can see that mac doesn't find sdl2
17:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://github.com/AssassinTee/teeworlds/commit/5bd08c7804884dda911d17b2fbcad38a3ecef4b8/checks?check_suite_id=385066970
17:17 < Oy> that bam change breaks normal windows build
17:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Only for systems where python is not in the path var
17:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> unrelated: the change to `is_bundled(SDL2_BUNDLED "${SDL2_LIBRARIES}")` looks weird, `is_bundled` only takes a single path and `${SDL2_LIBRARIES}` sounds like it could contain multiple, (but with the current code it can't, so it works)
17:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, that happens with the standard python install
17:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that python is not in PATH
17:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Hmm... A solution would be to let python handle the file writing stuff
17:18 < Oy> what probably most users do
17:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Then you can also use the file association on gh actions
17:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @heinrich5991 yeah. This change was rather unintentional
17:23 < Oy> could also do a config check if python is in path and then use the python call, otherwise use it like it's now
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> is teeworlds careing about python2 or python3?
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *caring
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> python 2 was EOL 4 days ago, at this point we can treat a python in path as a bug üòõ
17:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> a python 2
17:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and when is python 4 coming? üòõ
17:27 < Oy> could probably drop python2 now
17:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> not at all according to the python community, Assa
17:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The ddnet cmakelist has no output for it but it seems like Travis has the dmgtools installed. That's not the case on gh actions üòï
17:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm, `HDIUTIL` seems to be what it needs on mac
17:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @redix link to the output on gh actions?
17:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Not found according to cmake
17:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/axblk/teeworlds/runs/373101847
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Packaging was deactivated for mac in this build
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> But it says that dmgtools and hdiutil are not installed
17:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/axblk/teeworlds/runs/373078197
17:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm. stuff on internet forums implies that `hdiutil` is always installed on mac systems
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Yeah... Seems so. Not sure why cmake does not find it though
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so the question is why cmake doesn't find it or why it isn't installed on github's macs
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ye
17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> But ddnet log on Travis says the same
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> the dependency status showing is buggy
17:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> for `HDIUTIL`
17:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so we can probably assume that it is actually there
17:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> (variable `HDIUTIL_FOUND` is checked, but it is not set anywhere)
17:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @redix what's the next problem?
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I'll check the Mac packaging stuff again later üëç 
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> On windows I'll check whether python is in path
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Last problem is that the sdl+freetype download often fails on windows+bam
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> https://github.com/axblk/teeworlds/runs/373078175
18:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> forum spam.
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> down
18:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> forum is refreshingly fast
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @redix why not use freetpye and sdl binaries that are given?
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> at least this happens in my (failing) windows build
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> There are none in the tw repo
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> bam downloads them but the python script fails sometimes
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> oh yeah, true <.<
19:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 0.7.5 when
19:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> xd
20:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> in game server browser refresh button doesnt work apparently, or is it me?
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> sometimes its bugged, yes
20:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> had this one time too
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I find it very weird that you cant toggle dynamic camera just using f1 cl_dynamic_camera. You have to use the button in the settings or set the rest manually.
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Vanilla code:
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/e036ee22b5021c738b766ed1c63e227e05678be4/src/game/client/components/menus_settings.cpp#L968
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ddnet has changed that:
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/77957c00b94611c6cec697f228b98d981830ee6c/src/game/client/components/menus_settings.cpp#L93
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 
20:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I dont know exactly how they handle the rest, but we should do the same in vanilla
20:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> well actually
20:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> we can just remove them, they are all different variables
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> And about scroll bars: Can we also change the small side scroll bar when the browser doesnt have the right side menu? i am talking about the slider in the player scoreboard menu
22:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Go ahead :p
22:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> I think the corners are negative on that one
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Finally... building and packaging works on all platforms üòÑ
22:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> noice üëç
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @redix i removed bam from my repo, to merge your pr I guess I only have to remove build-bam: and everything under it in the github file? (and ofc re-remove the bam files)?
23:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yes
23:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> okay thanks
