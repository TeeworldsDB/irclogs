16:19 < Teeworlds> [teeworlds] oy closed pull request #1904: Always use colorful gametype and level icons in the browser instead of grayscale (master...feature-colorful-browser) https://git.io/fppzJ
17:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Thx :)
17:11 < Dune_linux> damn, the connection is so weak I can use IRC but no discord
17:12 < minus> ha!
18:36 < TeeSlayer> it's not possible to pass arguments to .cfg files, right?
18:36 < TeeSlayer> for templating configuration files
18:38 <@Dune> well
18:39 < Dune> well
18:39 < Dune> you can start a .cfg from another .cfg using exec
18:39 < TeeSlayer> yeah I know
18:39 < Dune> otherwise I don't really see what your usecase is
18:40 < TeeSlayer> I want to know if I can pass arguments using exec
18:41 < Oy> no, u can just execute a config file
18:43 < TeeSlayer> the problem is that i want to change sv_name for each vote
18:43 < TeeSlayer> so that players know what kind of options the server has activated
18:43 < Oy> possible
18:43 < Dune> That is possible with different .cfg files, and using exec :)
18:44 < TeeSlayer> I already see myself writing a config generator for teeworlds^^
18:45 < TeeSlayer> the thing is, I can't change the name of my server in add_vote
18:45 < TeeSlayer> since the name includes special characters
18:45 < TeeSlayer> escaping is not possible
18:45 < TeeSlayer> neither is using single quotes within the double quotes
18:45 < TeeSlayer> or am I missing something?
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can do add_vote X exec configX
18:46 < TeeSlayer> yeah but then I would have to 
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> and configX contains all the configs you want, including sv_name
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> TeeSlayer ^
18:46 < TeeSlayer> change do many, many .cfg files
18:47 < TeeSlayer> s/change//
18:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah, maybe
18:51 < TeeSlayer> I have 14 servers on 0.7 right now^^
18:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you can make folders
20:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Oy: should we close downloads of 0.6.0<x<0.6.4?
22:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <guenstig werben> No lol
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Dune yes, probably
22:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if by "close" you mean hide from the downloads page
22:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah.
