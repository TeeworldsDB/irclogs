18:00 < Bzhu> Hi, I still haven’t really switched to teeworlds 0.7.* because I am having some annoying keyboard issues which I didn’t have in 0.6.*
18:00 < Bzhu> Is it the right place to ask?
18:00 < Bzhu> this*
18:05 < Bzhu> Here are the keyboard problems i have:
18:05 < Bzhu> - escape key does nothing except when the input for chatting is open; once the game menu is open, the only way I can go back to the game is by joining a different team
18:06 < Bzhu> - when the input for chatting is open, backspace deletes 2 characters instead of one
18:08 < Bzhu> - F1 does not open the console (despite being bound to it), same for F2 and rcon
18:18 < Edible> it is, but rules of IRC are, stay and wait for an answer
18:25 < Bzhu> no problem
18:26 < Bzhu> Oh, maybe I’ve not waited enough in the past… I may have reported the same issues before :)
18:29 < Bzhu> About the keyboard issues, I must add that I didn’t experience them on my computer at work (I’m not playing during work hours, only during breaks)
18:29 < Bzhu> (just making it clear :D)
18:30 < Bzhu> So this might have to do with Debian 9 (my work computer has Ubuntu)
18:46 < Bzhu> Sorry… my internet connection is not the most reliable
