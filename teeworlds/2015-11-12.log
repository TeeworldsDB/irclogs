17:50 < Learath2> matricks: since you are in the industry may i ask wtf is the industries obsession with nvidia gameworks ?
17:51 <@matricks> is it?
17:52 < Learath2> latest example would be fallout 4 i guess
17:53 < Learath2> nvidia gameworks is like saying thx amd users we didnt want you to have good graphics anyways
17:53 <@matricks> dunno never used it
17:54 <@matricks> I guess it supplys a bunch of free effects
18:03 <@minus> Learath2: like physx
18:05 <@matricks> minus: https://benedikt-bitterli.me/tantalum/tantalum.html
18:05 < Learath2> unless nvidia is actually paying the studios to use it i dont see how it is in anyway a good plan to hinder some percentage of your players experience :P
18:05 <@matricks> minus: should be able to get that to run in real time
18:06 <@minus> ofc
