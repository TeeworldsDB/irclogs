16:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> @ChillerDragon  do you have a 0.7.3 headless tw client? for testing game mechanics?
16:39 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> need dummies ._.
16:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> I think there is a server function to spawn dummies
16:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> `sv_dummies`
16:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> dbg_dummies ?
16:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah nvm me :)
16:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> except you break it, like I did
16:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> what?
17:09 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> I broke this feature in my current mod
18:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Assa still wip sorri
18:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 *
21:53 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dbg_dummies kinda never worked anywhere? or what's the proper way to use it?
21:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> I use it plentifully
21:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> dbg_dummies 4;reload
21:54 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> for example
22:01 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thanks, gonna test.
23:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oh and you need debug build as far as I remember @jxsl13
23:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> maybe you need to set `debug 1`
23:16 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I think dummies are a server side feature and they depend on the debug build flag. And debug 1 is an client command. As far as I know.
23:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah, it's a `dbg_` command, compile in debug mode
23:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> cmake seems to compile to debug by default
23:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> works fine
23:33 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> thanks, saves a lot of fidling with crap.
23:34 < Dune> bam also compiles to debug by default
