10:08 < cClaude> Hello, I can find any documentation to build teeworlds-server only. Is-it possible ?
10:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> when using cmake you can turn off client compilation with -DCLIENT=OFF
10:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> mkdir build && cd build
10:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> cmake .. -DCLIENT=OFF
10:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> make
10:13 < cClaude> thank ! great - is this working on an headless machin ? (linux without gui) 
10:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes ðŸ™‚
10:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> you can even compile the client on a headless machine but ye the client has more annoying dependencys so -DCLIENT=OFF wil make less trouble for sure
10:15 < cClaude> Thank, perfect.
10:20 < cClaude> Devteam did a Great job. Especially on dependencies detection. As a feedback - I was able to compile server part on raspbian/buster headless. Thank again.
10:36 < rand> cmake usage is a great addition
10:37 < rand> I'm still using bam though ^^
11:11 < minus> why not plain makefiles
11:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i am no expert at all but from what i know are makefiles a bit harder to maintain on different platforms. I guess it is also easier to use cmake for dependency management.
11:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Anyathing that bothers you about cmake, minus?
11:17 < minus> everything
11:32 < Dune> cClaude: you can thank heinrich5991 for that work :)
11:33 < cClaude> For sure !
11:35 < cClaude> heinrich5991: Thank your work on teeworlds, Especially on dependencies detection. I was able to build a teeworlds_server on a raspberry PI in less than 10 minutes. Last time it took me several days. Great achievement !
11:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> cmake is a greatly used and documented standard build tool and it's easier to include existing libalraries with cmake.
17:36 < Kottizen> What happened to bam? :o
17:36 < Dune> Kottizen: o/
17:36 < Dune> it's still doing good
17:37 < Dune> some people worked on cmake support though :)
17:38 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1730
17:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> bam > cmake

17:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> xd
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> minority opinion*
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> s
17:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Kottizen lives :0
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is there any python library to cummunicate with tw/master servers?
17:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> comminicate*
17:53 < Dune> not sure about python, maybe rust though? https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2 :)
17:56 < rand> master ? part of it on github/teeworlds
18:01 < rand> enough to get server list
18:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> also online player data?
18:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> gonna test, thanks
18:08 < rand> it's not implemented as a lib, but you should be able to extract the useful parts
18:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> yeah, I don't really need a lib, just something to work with
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @jxsl13 here so wip in python https://gist.github.com/Learath2/a071797508435ac35a3ae13c75e6fab5
18:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but that thing doesnt talk to the master it is a master xd
18:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is there a way do deactivate warump and ready players and all that stuff completley?
18:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's a kinda cool concept.
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/629354811577466881/Bildschirmfoto_2019-10-03_um_18.31.06.png
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> The actual question might be, how did you find that?
18:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Learath2 uses easy passwords
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> XD
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no he posted and discussed that stuff in #developer of ddnet
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok ðŸ˜®
18:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so i have ``sv_warump 0`` but when i join the server i get a big annpoying warmup text and a green checkmark in scoreboard how to remove that?
18:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that checkmark is called ready state
18:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dunno much about it :c
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> -1 iirc
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> me neither and i really dont like it and its so frustrating that that stuff is not deactivated completly by default
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> k ima try thanks
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nope @Dune
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is that even used in vanilla in any way?
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> It's difficult to take the decision to remove features from Teeworlds. They are always useful to a few
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> you can stop games and stuff
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and how exactly do ppl use that?
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> did u ever play pro games?
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> back in 0.6 they wrote stop in chat
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> by using the ready bind
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> then everybody stopped moving xd
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I never played vanilla
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `r` by default
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and never will xD
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and then some1 writes start (a time) in chat and then all start moving again
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that I did see
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> also on instagib servers
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and the ready bind allows one player to actually stop the game. And it only continues when all press ready again.
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> are you playing a survival mode, @ChillerDragon ?
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but this should not be default for public servers
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the ready stuff is only enabled for survival mode
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but how is that supposed to work on vanilla, can any person join the match and the press r to simply pause the match?
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no ctf
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes @jxsl13
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `sv_countdown -1; sv_warmup -1`
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> exploitation incoming
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> and trolling
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but that is off by default
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and in pro games there are no trolls
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @jxsl13 no, it is disabled by default
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/3ebfbf200017cafd82eb87c7c75b5ece1505e78f/src/game/variables.h#L113
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but the weird warump and ready checkmark is tho
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hence sv_countdown -1; sv_warmup -1
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> idk if it even does something but it looks bad
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ye sec
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nope @Dune
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> sorry, sv_warmup 0; it shouldn't have any warmup by default
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the checkmarks are visible, even tho it's disabled by default(on zcatch, based on survival)
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> -1 is for player ready state :)
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> still there
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> reload
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> restarted server
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> edited config
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nub ðŸ˜®
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what is still there,
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the green checkmarks on warmup?
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> all of it
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> the warmup?
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> screenshot or didn't happen
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> that is not normal
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> THE BIG WARMUP text on join and the checkmark in scoreboard
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> there should be no warmup with `sv_warmup 0` (default)
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> screenshot or never happened ðŸ˜„
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> most servers don't have a warmup on afaik atm
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/629356971522260993/screenshot_2019-10-03_18-39-33.png
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I have that checkmark problem on zCatch as well, it seemingly does nothing and ppl are confused as why the checkmarks are shown in the scoreboeard, when a warmup is currently being played
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> there is no actual countdown
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but this warump message
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> ah, but there is no countdown
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how to remove that
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and what does it do?
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well there is not enough players, game will only start when there are enough players
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> does warmup need a countdown and ppl would then need to press r? to say they are ready and the survival game would start?
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> you're on 073+?
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and what does that mean game is not starting?
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im on master
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> well, scorelimit/timelimit are not effective
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> survival mode has some kinda players restriction, before it starts
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so there is no way to remove that?
18:41 < Oy> and u can respawn in survival
18:41 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and what about the checkmark in scoreboard how to remove that?
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I don't understand the purpose of those checkmarks in survival still :c
18:42 < Oy> doubt u can
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it's only during warmup afaik
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> yeah I don't think you can
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> can we fix that pls?
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> they are on warmup there
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> they are basically always on warmup there.
18:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> go ahead https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1690
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ah ye its a mess anyways also stuff like restart (time) does nothing
18:43 < Oy> cause it's warmup
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> the ready system is actually cool but all the other stuff is so confusing
18:44 < Dune> there are too many settings that very few people know how to pilot properly
18:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> especially too confusing for vanilla
18:45 < Dune> imo there should be a "competitive mode" setting that enables pausing; and sv_warmup. No readymode whatsoever outside of competitive mode
18:46 < Dune> well I guess that's equivalent to sv_player_ready_mode
18:46 < Dune> just get rid of `sv_countdown` then? double countdowns suck anyway
18:47 < Oy> i think u added it because of the double countdowns?
18:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> rip my brain ðŸ˜„
18:51 < Dune> I forgot :/
18:52 < Oy> :D
18:52 < Oy> think the double countdowns are gone already
18:52 < Dune> my bad then
18:52 < Oy> think u removed them
18:52 < Dune> just trying to simplifying the UI
18:52 < Oy> and added sv_countdown for survival
18:52 < Dune> right, survival needs that
18:53 < Dune> my understanding is that @ChillerDragon complains about the "Warmup - waiting for more players" display
18:53 < Dune> aka you can't start a CTF game and score flags if you're alone
18:53 < Oy> you can in warmup
18:54 < Oy> there's just no scorelimit
18:54 < Oy> dunno if that should be removed - you can't play alone
18:55 < Dune> yeah but if someone joins the game is reset, right
18:55 < Oy> yeah then the game starts and resets
18:55 < Oy> kinda fair
18:56 < Oy> otherwise you have to do a restart vote manually
18:56 < Dune> right
18:56 < Dune> any other issues with the current state @ChillerDragon
18:57 < Dune> do you have a good idea what https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1690 is about now, Oy?
18:58 < Oy> well yeah, would be nice if the settings (warmup, readymode etc) could be simpler, more intuitive
18:58 < Oy> Dune: hm dunno :D
18:59 < Oy> there are more timer issues i think
18:59 < Dune> they're closed
18:59 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1635
18:59 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2154
18:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> master server 4 kinda doesn't respond to my requests :'c
18:59 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2153
19:00 < Oy> maybe rethink the whole thing? make a list what should be there and then try to make it as simple as possible
19:01 < Dune> it's really mangled with the rest of the code, not so easy to isolate :(
19:01 < Oy> true
19:02 < Dune> I think it would be more effort than patching the reported bugs :/
19:02 < Oy> survival added some complexity to it
19:02 < Oy> maybe :D
19:02 < Oy> if we don't create new ones with the fixes :D
19:03 < Dune> besides, changing the whole thing in a minor version can be confusing, if options do something different from one version to another (or are renamed)
19:04 < Dune> I don't know, I don't see any pretty solution 
19:04 < Dune> I suggest to move it to 0.7.5 milestone :D
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ...
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the earlier the better, while 0.7 doesn't have that many players yet.
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ._. getting super weird results when using the tw_api.py like every master server having 55 servers except the 4th one having no servers. status.tw as a reference seems to tell a different story there and my tw client as well :c
19:11 < rand> tw_api is a bit aggressive and do not wait a lot, packets might be lost
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ah, ok ðŸ˜®
19:11 < rand> it's a guess
19:11 < rand> I agree about the weird results
19:12 < rand> do all master servers are 0.7 ?
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there was waiting stuff added, I thought it was needed for the thread synchronization, as I could not find any thread.join()s
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> so I removed the waiting xD
19:16 < rand> sometimes a packet has a wrong token, I don't understand why
19:16 < rand> maybe it is annouced twice
19:18 < rand> it's supposed to use a set so no
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol, I found the error
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> the recvfrom buffer size is too small
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> 1024
19:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ðŸ˜®
19:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well and added thread joins
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Server ('176.9.140.14', 8303) info header mismatch: b'!\xdcj9\xdaG\xb7\xd5\xdb\xff\xff\xff\xffinf3\x00' != b'!\xdcj9\xda4\x94F\x1e\xff\xff\xff\xffinf3\x00' (expected)
19:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> there should be something before expeted, but is empty
19:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> last sentence is wrong :'c
19:45 < Oy> any problems with moving the logfile to savepath/dumps/ like all the other logfiles?
19:54 < rand> @jxsl13: what should it be ? 
20:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I increased the buffer to 4096 and now staying with 4 * 4096 everywhere there is 1024
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dups sounds kinda weird for a log folder.
20:27 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dumps
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is it possible to add a logs folder like all of the other stuff that's being created in that  first storage.cfg add_path folder?
20:28 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> (easily possible) @Oy
20:34 < Oy> kinda overhead to have a logs and dumps folder
20:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what's in the dumps folder?
20:57 < Dune> stuff like `dump_local_console`
20:59 < Dune> also, try ctrl+shift+numpad0 ig :p
21:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I mean server side dumps folder? is that folder even necessary for the server?
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or is that a rcon command Oo
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> client command
21:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> folder is created when the server is started with a modified storage path
21:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> so dump's isn't used for servers, I guess at all.
21:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> -'s
21:44 < Oy> it's always created in the storage path
21:44 < Oy> dbg_lognetwork used by server
21:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what's the use case on the server side there?
21:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> for dumps
21:47 < Oy> dbg_lognetwork
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> possible to simply rename it for the server side to logs?
21:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> or is the behaviour shared between server and client?
21:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> dumps -> logs for server side
22:12 < Oy> yeah shared
22:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> well, I guess it would be too much of a hassle to rename that, as it might be weird on the client side.
