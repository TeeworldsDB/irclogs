02:18 <@heinrich5991> Slinack: try sv_external_port 8303 maybe
02:25 < Slinack> hey, thanks for answering. That didn't solve it. I fail to see how sv_external_port works. Even after setting it to 8303, it would be listed as ip-address:8307
02:32 < fstd> Slinack: a network traffic dump might provide some insight
02:42 < Slinack> Would that be possible through some server command (maybe dbg_lognetwork)? otherwise I think I fall short on that knowledge :)
02:43 <@heinrich5991> some tcpdump ocmmand
02:43 <@heinrich5991> dunno which though
02:43 < Slinack> Or using something like wireshark. That could be too advanced for my friend anyway
02:45 < fstd> tcpdump on the server and/or wireshark on the client, yes
02:46 < fstd> on linux,  tcpdump -i eth0 -w /path/to/result udp  would likely do the trick
03:05 < Slinack> If I have any returns from my friend, I'll bring it back to you :) thanks guys
