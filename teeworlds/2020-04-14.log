00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ooh, I know
00:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> we keep rendering that checker pattern with 0.5 opacity over and over
00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> zeno's paradox we make it half as dark each round, which eventually turns it black
00:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> well don't even need zeno's paradox as floats have limited bits ðŸ˜›
00:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> fun isn't it?
00:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hence the gray bg
00:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I don't think we need to optimise that clear tbh, it's part of how the bg is rendered without a map
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> a map would be rendering a quad after the yellow gfx_clear which is even more expensive then a clear
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> or someone needs to come up with a different background
00:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> one that renders something that's opaque
00:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> hmm, well gfx_clear should not have any effects if no map is being rendered
00:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> and menus should activate the menus clear only if they are not rendering a map
08:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Which is what I do in my patch
08:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Only inside renderbackground I clear, because the clear is actually a part of the background
11:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Then should ask oy when does the double clear happen
11:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @Learath2 perhaps he wants you to only clear the screen when `none` is selected as background
11:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> RenderBackground won't even be called if none isnt selected
11:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> hm. then I don't get oy
12:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> isn't copy paste supposed to be working on Linux? can't seem to make it work
12:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> also, it seems like when I connect to a server using `connect <ip>`, the ip is not saved in the ip address bar, so when I reconnect, it connects to another server. this was not the previous behaviour
13:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> in fact, ctrl+shift+d does not work either :D I wonder why
