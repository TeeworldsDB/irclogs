00:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> It seems like instead of `force_vote` it's simply vote
00:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Is there a way(is it possible) to specify server config path relative to the user's home directory?
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> e.g. `exec ~/config/server.cfg` or `teeworlds_srv -f ~/config/config1.cfg``
00:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> no, apparently not
00:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> sad stuff :/
00:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> can I open an issue or is this too much to implement?
00:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> imo you can open an issue
00:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> not for `exec ~/â€¦` though
00:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that'd give teeworlds server admins access to the local file system
00:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> if you want to give the server access to your file system, use symlinks
00:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> good night
00:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ok, gn8
00:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I just want a possible starting point other than the executable, might be something like $CONFIG_DIR
09:06 < rand> jxsl13, you can also change storage.cfg
12:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> a working example would help, cuz I don't know how.
12:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> There are instructions in storage.cfg afaik
13:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> seems like combination of `add_path ~/` or `add_path ~` in combination with`teeworlds_srv -f config/config.cfg` or `teeworlds_srv -f ~/config/config.cfg` doesn't work, it it also seems that the storage.cfg isn't being copied into the cmake build folder at all, so I copied it next to the executable.
13:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> There is a problem since 0.7, `$APPDATA` or whatever its called, which got added in 0.7, lets the function `CStorage::ListDirectory()` go through each file twice
13:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> if you remove the entry from storage.cfg it only lists each file once
13:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> When the server starts (dont know about client, should be the same), the log shows that this entry and another one shows the exact same path, so I dont know why it is even there
14:13 < redix> in many cases $CURRENTDIR and $APPDIR are the same, but when you start the server from another directory, they are not. This could be solved by just removing duplicate entries from m_aaStoragePaths
14:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> and if two different files with the same name appear from different directories?
14:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Does it work?
14:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it has a priority, first come first servers, depending on the paths in the storage.cfg
14:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> serves*
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> served*
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> x)
17:47 < Dune> A lot of users switch regularly between 0.6 and 0.7
17:48 < Dune> A UI for managing the path to `settings.cfg` could be useful. Very few people know how to configure that
17:56 < Oy> could start to use a different name/path?
18:02 < Dune> that would be good too
18:02 < Dune> if not exists settings07: cp settings settings07
18:03 < Oy> yeah load settings when the 0.7 one isn't there
18:04 < Oy> could also put that in the configs folder in the save path now
18:05 < Dune> the configs folder?
18:06 < Dune> could also leave a comment in the settings.cfg indicating the version of the client I guess?
18:07 < Dune> not sure if that could be used anyhow in the future, but if anything, for the user
18:10 < Oy> http://www.solidfiles.com/v/6axexD6zzY8dd
18:11 < Oy> that's where configs are stored when you use the command "save_config" in the console
18:11 < Oy> yeah some version in the settings would be good
18:34 < Oy> any idea what's that about https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2238 ?
18:45 < Dune> I imagine steam wants some new picture format 
19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> is it possible to register a server build from latest git version on master server? Because it fails for me .-. is this intended?
20:00 < rand> I guess it is since I got one
