21:18 < ChillerDragon> @Sonix is it intentional that the right leaves of the new tree parts is randomly darker than any leaves in the doodads? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1602357385.png
21:21 < ChillerDragon> And idk what this is but the shadow of the stalagtits in the browser or inkscape does not seem to cover it fully but in gimp it looks fine https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1602357564.png
21:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> It’s not random, it’s darkened because the shadow of the tree is cast on it
22:58 < ChillerDragon> where is the sun? at the top left? So would it affect this one as well? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1602363422.png
22:59 < ChillerDragon> or straight from the top so it would affect this one? https://zillyhuhn.com/cs/.1602363460.png
23:00 < ChillerDragon> i feel like shadows from other objects might be a bit complex and do not fit in the current pattern
