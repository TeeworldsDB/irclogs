09:13 < TeeN> Hello everyone! I just started playing Teeworlds!
09:13 <@matricks> herro
09:14 < TeeN> Can anyone suggest a place for me to visit to get started?
09:14 < TeeN> I already had loads of fun with my friend yesterday on LAN
09:15 <@matricks> to get started playing?
09:16 < TeeN> As in you know some popular community maps(since we have already tried all the in game ones), some popular bots maybe ... I don't know... You tell me what else I should check out ...=D 
09:16 <@matricks> dunno, the forums? :P
09:17 < TeeN> Well that is fine =D
09:18 < TeeN> Are their categories of different posts? https://teeworlds.com/?page=journal doesn't seem to have any ...
09:18 < TeeN> Oh shit I'm very sorry
09:19 < TeeN> Just realized that was the blog
09:20 <@matricks> why is color allowed in this channel? o.o
09:26 < TeeN> What game modes exist other that ctf, dm? I have found run maps ...
09:29 < pinkieval> TeeN: there is also tdm (team death match)
09:29 < pinkieval> these are the official modes
09:30 < pinkieval> There are also several non-official ones. The most popular is DDRace, whose goal is not to fight, but to go through a complex map as fast as possible
10:02 < TeeN> Bye everyone! I'm leaving ... Got a whole new world to explore! =D
14:45 < koomi> that was cute :-)
