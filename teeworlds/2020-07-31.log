02:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it worked for 2 minutes :D then the master failed again

02:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> :(
02:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> usually its 1 minute, idk what happened
02:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> 2 minutes and 10 seconds
02:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> only register7 of course again, 6 works
02:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Okay. I decreased the heartbeat to 3 sec for testing and only tested with < 20 seconds. Maybe there is more that breaks =\
02:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Mhh
02:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but once again, thanks for looking into it
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @fokkonaut found the next issue. Guess what... uninitialized padding bytes in `NETADDR` when generating the tokens :D
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Pushed the fix to the same branch
15:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> shall I apply both?
15:24 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> yes
16:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> Ill try it later
16:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> the stuff above is about the matter with the server losing contact to the masterservers right?
16:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yes
16:47 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> when I compile with gcc 6.3 and logged into rcon I lost immediately contact to the masters
16:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> seems like it wasn't only me with the same problem
16:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ShootXen> clang seems to work for a long time but also loses contact to masterserver after a while on debian9
19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> can you try out the patch by redix?
19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> i cant try it right now
19:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> but i would like to know if it works with it implemented and NOT without it
