21:32 <+necropotame> Just to make sure, since Oy stated that TeeWorlds will stay as it is, minus and heinrich5991, do you want to participate to TeeUniverse by any means ? I guess the most needed part ATM is to discuss the core and the structure. Not that I'm trying to get as much people as I can, but you are welcome :)
21:32 <@minus> writing a reply right now :3
21:43 <@minus> i'd prefer to see teeworlds move forward and not migrate to some other project or fork
21:43 <@minus> ^ necropotame
21:43 <@minus> i fear teeworlds is about to make that split though
21:47 <+necropotame> I understand. Just that the seems stuck for me. And I also don't want to go too far with a bad core :D On addition, TeeUniverse is not a fork, so it may not fit the needs in case of split
21:47 <+necropotame> The situation seems*
21:48 <@minus> either way, breaking the status quo will be good
21:50 <+necropotame> In which way ?
21:51 <@minus> things will get moving
