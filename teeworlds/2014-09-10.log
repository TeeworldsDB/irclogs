14:54 <@matricks> HI!
15:49 < SNAK3_> help i'm having a language problem D:
15:50 < SNAK3_> i want to display the current setting of a program and right now it's ¨currently set: yes" 
15:50 < SNAK3_> but i feel it's ugly :(
15:51 < SNAK3_> anyone sugestions ?
15:51 <@matricks> Option: Value
15:51 <@matricks> Death Blades: Active
15:51 < SNAK3_> nonono 
15:51 < SNAK3_> look 
15:51 < SNAK3_> i have a dropdown menu 
15:52 < SNAK3_> with the 1st option the currently set option, the 2nd option yes and the 3rd option no 
15:52 < SNAK3_> i need a pretty way to formulate the currently set value 
15:52 < SNAK3_> so the first option 
15:52  * matricks has not time
15:53 < SNAK3_> ^^
15:57 < SNAK3_> present value
15:57 < SNAK3_> :D
16:24 < SNAK3_> what exactly does sv_spectator _slots do ?
16:26 < laxa_work> number of slots reserved to spectators
16:27 < laxa_work> if sv_spectator_slots is 8
16:27 < SNAK3_> so if i make a 16 slot player 
16:27 < SNAK3_> and set sv_spectator_slot to 15 
16:27 < laxa_work> then you can only have 8 players and 8 spectators on a 16 players server
16:27 < SNAK3_> allright :D 
16:27 < SNAK3_> thx
