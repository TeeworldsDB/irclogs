01:41 < JulianAsange> do u have a waifu botox
01:45 < BotoX> As you see, I do :3
02:57 < yemDX> BotoX, steins gate is trash and so is your waifu
02:57 < BotoX> minus: show this man the door
02:58 < yemDX> the door to trashville? b/c you're already there
02:58 < BotoX> hurrrrr

03:11 < JulianAsange> 'whoops'
03:30 < Inedible> yemDX, a thrash wife? you can marry cans now?
03:33 < Inedible> JulianAsange, you again huh?
03:33 < Inedible> also why am i reading this?
04:10 < JulianAsange> because it'sfunny
05:21 < noneofmynickswo> mmm i dont see the humor in assault
05:32 < JulianAsange> i do
05:40 < JulianAsange> i just found out, out of 20 or so people who like 'teeworlds' on facebook, 3 are girls
05:40 < JulianAsange> i mean 20 or so people who live in australia, who like teeworlds
09:25 < JulianAssange> fisted: can you stop
12:46 <@matricks> minus: https://telegram.org

12:55 < JulianAssange> https://telegram.org/img/tl_card_open.png?1
12:56 <@matricks> :P
12:56 < JulianAssange> https://telegram.org/crypto_contest time to get working!
12:57 < EastBite> good luck then
12:58 <@matricks> I hope you fail
12:58 < JulianAssange> :D
12:58 < JulianAssange> that's for the algorythum i guess
13:00 <@minus> > cloud-based
13:00 <@minus> centralized, ew
13:00 < JulianAssange> lole
13:01 < EastBite> and not even opensource
13:01 < JulianAssange> i dont get why you would even bother w/ that stuff
13:01 < JulianAssange> it's only as secure as your phone
13:01 < JulianAssange> which in the case of androids and iphones.. nsa has 0day'sfor those
13:07 <@minus> phones are inherantly insecure. the phone network chip has access to everything is likely to be full of bugs
13:09 < JulianAssange> someone remind me of the word for a box that is fully metal, and doesn't let any signals through it
13:09 < JulianAssange> like elevators
13:09 <@minus> pharaday cage?
13:10 <@minus> the spelling is most likely wrong
13:10 < JulianAssange> Faraday Cage
13:10 < JulianAssange> yeah
13:10 < JulianAssange> that
13:10 < JulianAssange> only way to be secure is have a 100% faraday cage, a laptop, GPG, and aprinter
13:10 < JulianAssange> and then it probably could still get pwned by the nsa
13:11 <@matricks> JulianAssange: and you can trust the laptop?
13:11 < JulianAssange> GPG your emails/text/etc., print it out, and send it through the mail. and make sure the computer (and the printer, because it could be sucking up data), leaves the daraday cage
13:11 < JulianAssange> that's why you use a daraday cage
13:11 < JulianAssange> fara
13:12 <@matricks> better use a sound booth as well
13:12 < JulianAssange> you'd hope the fara cage does that :D

13:16 < Nimda3> [YouTube] Title: Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) How a Faraday Cage/Box Can Save Electronics | Rating: 4.98/5.00 | Views: 7,892
13:16 < JulianAssange> heh
13:16 <@minus> mh
13:17 <@minus> electromagnetics is awesome
13:17 < JulianAssange> i want to build a portable emp lol
13:18 <@minus> railguns are awesome too
13:19 < JulianAssange> i read about thsoe
13:19 < JulianAssange> but i didn't get the point
13:23 <@matricks> ... why would I build a faraday cage to protect my electronics...
13:24 < JulianAssange> because if an EMP went off
13:24 < JulianAssange> it would [hopefully] be saved
13:25 <@matricks> yeahh... but it's not my stuff I'm worried about...
13:25 <@matricks> it's all the rest of the stuff I'm worried about
13:25 <@matricks> infrastructure, like he said in the beginning
13:25 < JulianAssange> wat:>==?
13:25 < JulianAssange> oh
13:25 < JulianAssange> well you can't do anything about that
13:26 <@matricks> if everyones electronic equipment dies, well, thats not a huge problem, but if the infrastructure goes... wel.. shit son
13:26 < JulianAssange> if a big city is atomic bombed, then the surrounding areas will be EMP'd, right
13:26 < JulianAssange> so, what would you need?
13:26 <@matricks> food
13:26 <@matricks> medical supplies
13:27 < JulianAssange> what would you need what would be affected by an EMP
13:27 < JulianAssange> generator(?)
13:27 <@matricks> electricity
13:27 <@matricks> logistics
13:27 < JulianAssange> industrial sattelite phone/computer
13:28 <@matricks> for communication yes
13:28 < JulianAssange> i uess that's it
13:28 < JulianAssange> guess*
13:29 < JulianAssange> newer cars would be affected, but the best thing to do would get an ol car
13:29 <@matricks> fridges etc are a problem as well
13:29 <@matricks> say the powernet is hit and down, thats a huge problem
13:30 < JulianAssange> what is powernet?
13:30 <@matricks> the powergrid
13:30 < JulianAssange> oh
13:30 < JulianAssange> that's what the generator is for
13:30 < JulianAssange> personal use
13:30 < JulianAssange> not for the whole grid
13:30 <@matricks> yeah
13:31 < JulianAssange> and assuming infrastucture does get hit, i'm sure atleast one power line will go down
13:31 <@matricks> JulianAssange: but if you have it, and noone else, you might wanna get a gun as well
13:31 < JulianAssange> but that's why you'd want a faraday cage
13:31 < JulianAssange> why would you tell anyone :D
13:31 < JulianAssange> oh yeah
13:31 < JulianAssange> and some electronic gun in the cage
13:32 <@matricks> if the infrastructure goes, everyone would be reduced to searching for foor
13:32 <@matricks> food, and that is quickly gonna become a huge problem to get
13:33 < JulianAssange> you'd need a gun anyways(for that exactly)
13:33 < JulianAssange> mass looting etc
13:33 <@matricks> if logistics etc breaks down
13:33 <@minus> let's hope it never comes to that
13:33 <@matricks> as I said, it's not your personal electornics you wanna protect :)
13:33 <@matricks> wooho, you have a computer and generator, lets play doom! :D
13:34 <@minus> \o/
13:34 < JulianAssange> sattelite copmuter
13:34 < JulianAssange> to contact outside entities
13:34 <@matricks> when shit hits the fan, the one with the food will become the rich
13:35 <@minus> matricks's got it all planned out
13:35 <@minus> …or been playing DayZ
13:35 <@matricks> and its then you really don't wanna be in a big city that is really really dependent on the infrastructure to meet the demand for food
13:35 < JulianAssange> depending on the scale of the attack(if it's like multiple cities throughout a country), contact would be good to let some government entity that they are alive
13:36 <@matricks> I mean, count all the supermarkets, the food that is there, how long would it really sustain a city
13:36 <@matricks> JulianAssange: I think they will send someone to check up on what happend
13:36 < JulianAssange> the city would be blown up wouldn't it
13:36 <@matricks> I'm talking pure EMP, not nuke here
13:36 < JulianAssange> oh
13:37 <@matricks> emp goes, electicity and infrastructure goes, _food_ will be the problem, I garantee it
13:37 < JulianAssange> yes of course
13:37 < JulianAssange> and water depending on the country
13:37 <@matricks> and food supply will go fast because we trust electicity to keep it
13:38 < JulianAssange> imagine if cities were EMP'd and that was it
13:38 < JulianAssange> the government would be waiting for the nuke beause what's the point in pure emp 
13:39 < JulianAssange> other than main infrastructure, etc., there will be a lot of angry kids that can't play cod, or take pictures of their food :D
13:39 < JulianAssange>  http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/ epic website btw
13:40 < JulianAssange> ussr made an aprox.  100mt  hydrogen bomb 
13:46 <@matricks> tsar bomba
13:46 <@matricks> reduced to 54.. or 56mt
13:46 < JulianAssange> apparently ie would because there would be too much fallout if it was the full 100mt
13:47 < JulianAssange> damn russians..
13:48 <@matricks> ussr always built the biggest coolest stuff
13:48 <@matricks> same when they had the airplane battle
13:50 < JulianAssange> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Goldsboro_B-52_crash nice
13:51 < JulianAssange> Russia was able to set off their weapons in the similarly desolate region of the country known as "the part that's not Moscow."
13:51 < JulianAssange> lmao
13:51 <@matricks> the germans were building quite cool stuff at the end of WW2
13:52 <@matricks> like.. stealth fighters
13:56 < JulianAssange> here we go
13:56 < JulianAssange> http://www.cracked.com/article_19546_7-nuclear-weapon-screw-ups-you-wont-believe-we-survived.html
13:56 < JulianAssange> "The detonation released an enormous electromagnetic pulse that knocked out power in Hawaii 870 miles away and wrecked one-third of all the satellites orbiting the earth at that time. Basically, unless a satellite was hiding behind the earth, it was rendered useless."
14:00 < JulianAssange> so matricks.. are you ready for the end of the world?
14:01 <@matricks> nope
14:05  * minus np: Mordi - Liljedahl is God (Green Beret+Rambo)
14:05 <@minus> weeee
14:05 <@minus> weekend soon
14:05 <@matricks> wörk wörk wörk
