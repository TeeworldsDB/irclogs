11:34 < goo> Well, those who don't whither away quickly. Which is what makes retirement a terrible idea
11:37 < goo> Many fail to plan their retirement, end up sitting at home watching tv, waiting to die
11:39 <@matricks> many people fail to live their life :)

20:21 < jxsl13> root@158050:/home/uptee/bam# ./make_unix.sh 
20:21 < jxsl13> Segmentation fault
20:21 < jxsl13> getting an error when trying to compile bam
21:05 <@minus> nice
21:41 < JulianAssange> jxsl13: what os
21:41 < JulianAssange> or distro
21:42 < jxsl13> I was kinda missing build_essential so, it didnt work ._.
21:42 < jxsl13> was a new installation
21:42 < jxsl13> already solved
21:44 < JulianAssange> yes, i was going to say, if you were using linux, do apt-get build-dep bam
21:44 < JulianAssange> using ubuntu*
21:44 < JulianAssange> i'm tired :(
21:44 < EastByte> go to sleep!
21:45 < JulianAssange> no
21:47 < jxsl13> apt-get build-essential did the job
21:48 < jxsl13> but thanks anyway
21:49 < JulianAssange> apt-get install* :>
21:49 < JulianAssange> i ask the sillist questions when tired.. is 0/-0 infinite, or minus infinite?
21:50 < EastByte> minus infinite
21:50 < EastByte> ._.
21:50 < botnik> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=._.
21:50 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: in floating point numbers it's NaN
21:50 < heinrich5991> not a number
21:51 < heinrich5991> in mathematics it's just not defined, as isn't 1/0
21:52 < JulianAssange> gurlllll
22:07 < JulianAssange> http://new4.fjcdn.com/gifs/Straya+cunt+what+s+a+description_4a5d76_5433222.gif <- can confirm. live in australia
22:08 < EastByte> wanna meet my sister there?
22:08 < JulianAssange> is she hot?
22:08 < EastByte> 7/10
22:08 < JulianAssange> is she single?
22:08 < EastByte> yea
22:09 < JulianAssange> ok
22:09 < EastByte> n0pe
22:09 < JulianAssange> damn
22:10 < EastByte> work and travel in australia seems to be popular
22:10 < JulianAssange> yeah
22:13 < JulianAssange> is you sister actually in aus
22:14 < EastByte> yep, until August this year
22:14 < JulianAssange> why
22:16 < EastByte> she made her bachelor and wants to do work and travel before continuing
22:16 < JulianAssange> oh nice
22:21 < JulianAssange> i've been using coverity on PHP lately, and omg there are so many bugs
22:21 < JulianAssange> obviously it's not surprising (lol php), but some really basic ones.. buffer overflows / double free's / use after frees etc.
22:21 < JulianAssange> and lots of sizeof()'s, too
22:21 < EastByte> really?
22:22 < EastByte> I though people would fix stuff since php still is getting more popular
22:22 < JulianAssange> yeah, php7 was just released a few days ago(i sub to the dev mailing list)
22:22 < JulianAssange> but i
22:22 < JulianAssange> i'm still reporting lots of bugs from coverity
22:23 < EastByte> what's wrong with sizeof()'s? (atleast in C)
22:23 < JulianAssange> i mean, wrong ones
22:23 < EastByte> ah
22:23 < JulianAssange> memset(ctx, 0, sizeof(ctx));  vs. memset(ctx, 0, sizeof(*ctx));  
22:23 < EastByte> sounds scary
22:24 < JulianAssange> ^ that one is in the openssl extension, too
22:44 < JulianAssange> i don't know why that should even compile, tbh
