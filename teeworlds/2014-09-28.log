00:07 < pielover88888> sounds good
00:08 < pielover88888> where's the server hosted? Wondering cuz.. ping.
00:11 < laxa> France!
00:12 < pielover88888> aw, that's as bad as germany :(
00:12 < pielover88888> if I download the map and rehost it on local host, recording a demo of the race, do I still get the 10 euros?
00:12 < pielover88888> also does Paypal auto-convert euros to USD with magic, or not? I don't have a use for Euros being in the USA.
00:12 < laxa> Hum, I guess yeah.
00:13 < pielover88888> Cool.
00:13 < laxa> Yes paypal convert it, or you can give me IBAN.
00:13 < pielover88888> No idea what IBAN is xD
00:13 < laxa> !wiki IBAN
00:13 < Nimda3> The International Bank Account Number (IBAN) is an internationally agreed system of identifying bank accounts across national borders to facilitate the communication and processing of cross border transactions with a reduced risk of transcription errors. It was originally adopted by the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS), and later as an international standard under ISO 13616:... ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBAN )
00:14 < BotoX> hmm minus ?
00:14 < BotoX> oh nvm
00:14  * minus gives BotoX a cookie
00:15 <@minus> time to update bash
00:15 < BotoX> I did lel
00:15 < BotoX> anyways, it seems like my sister was using my PC
00:15 < BotoX> and I missed a bunch of highlights in this channel
00:16 < BotoX> also, the bash bug doesn't affect me in any way minus :V
00:17 <@minus> why not?
00:18 < BotoX> because I don't have any CGI scripts or other crap that could get abused
00:18 <@minus> well, you don't know where shit's hiding
00:18 < BotoX> hmm, I guess
00:18 <@minus> i don't have any of that stuff either
00:19 <@minus> well, maybe cgit, but i turned that off
00:19 < Edible> not really anyone's fault, I would love if you could set modes of operating, like night and so forth, but no such thing exists in any OS. 
00:20 <@minus> if you're referring to brightness, there's programs for that
00:20 < Edible> not only brightness
00:20 < Edible> but theme changing
00:20 <@minus> i have 250MB of gzipped html dumps :S
00:21 < Edible> whenever its night i have to open flux, dimmer, change the theme, change wifi settings. and reopen a bunch of programs
00:21 < Edible> hexchat also, because i cant see with the dark theme at morning
00:22  * minus rolls eyes
00:22 < k00mi> make a cronjob or similar
00:22 < Edible> a shellscript does it. i know
00:22 < k00mi> or get a lamp
00:22 < Edible> yes, but when is night? sometimes its 6pm, sometimes less
00:22 < Edible> dark**
00:23 < k00mi> look at how redshift does it
00:23 < Edible> k00mi, a lamp? this is a software problem.
00:24 < Edible> i missed the bash bug, what is that?
00:24 < Edible> i refuse to use bash or keep it installed
00:24 <@minus> bash executes code from any environment variable
00:24 <@minus> having it installed is bad enough
00:24 < Edible> executes code from any env variable?
00:25 <@minus> env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"
00:26 < k00mi> Edible: it's a non-problem if you have a light
00:27 < k00mi> there's a cool looking new arena shooter currently on kickstarter btw
00:27 < k00mi> http://reflexfps.net/
00:27 < k00mi> physics seem to be very cpm-like
00:27 < Edible> whats `{} {:;};  ?
00:27 < laxa> bash function
00:28 < Edible> oh! so it runs any and all functions in env ?
00:29 < k00mi> no
00:30 < Edible> as i said, i dont have bash to test that out
00:30 < k00mi> search for bash shellshock if you want to find out
00:30 <@minus> you have it installed
00:30 <@minus> that's enough
00:30 <@minus> oh, you don't have it installed
00:30 <@minus> how do you run bash scripts?
00:31 < k00mi> most work in other shells too
00:31 < k00mi> ones that don't pass functions in the environment
00:31 <@minus> i don't think sh does arrays though, at least not in the () form
00:31 < k00mi> and let you append code after them that get's executed
00:31 <@minus> yeah
00:31 <@minus> braindead
00:32 <@minus> if you want that there's eval
00:32 < k00mi> I don't get why anyone would ever want that feature
00:32 < Edible> minus, bsd sh.
00:32 < k00mi> that's some ash usually
00:32 < Edible> it doesnt do arrays
00:33 < Edible> everyone suggests using awk if you want arrays
00:33 < Edible> for portability
00:35 <@minus> no, i just put #!/bin/bash in my scripts
00:35 <@minus> #!/usr/bin/zsh if i'm feeling especially evil
00:35 < k00mi> I'm seriously considering switch to freebsd too
00:35 < Edible> you are a terrible person
00:35 < k00mi> at least for servers
00:35 < Edible> do it
00:35 < Edible> its so nice :)
00:36 <@minus> Kottizen made me use it once. no thanks.
00:37 <@minus> though arch on the servers ain't such a good idea either
00:38 < Edible> i tried ubuntu yesterday. very slow.
00:38 < k00mi> if I don't find a distribution with a decent init system I'll take the bite and switch
00:38 < k00mi> at least for future machines
00:38 < Edible> though that was gnome's fault
00:38 <@minus> Xfce.
00:38 < k00mi> they don't use gnome anymore, they have their own stuff
00:38 < Edible> but it didnt have other DE's and if there were, it lacked features.
00:39 < Edible> minus, so let me ask you a question, why do i need to open the setting>keyboard for shortcuts to work?
00:39 <@minus> oO
00:40 < Edible> and why the hell does it take the launcher about 20 seconds to actually execute?
00:40 <@minus> because you're running on a 1mhz machine?
00:40 < Edible> k00mi, right right, unity, sorry. i guess i havent tried gnome
00:41 < Edible> mmm 1.6ghz i think thats good enough
00:41 < k00mi> don't use a DE, only sane option
00:41 < Edible> funny, running everything with dmenu_run leaves a bunch of parent bash scripts. instead of just exec-ing
00:42 < Edible> k00mi, I'm mostly on windows nowadays so I'm kinda not.  :(
00:42 < Edible> i should ask in #xfce. there must be something wrong with the package then.
00:44 < k00mi> I'm sorry for you Edible :P
01:19 < pielover88888> welcome back, Minus.
01:20 <@minus> been a while since i rebooted
01:21 < pielover88888> ah
01:21 < pielover88888> good to reboot once every 4 days to make it stop acting stupid xD
01:21 <@minus> was ~7 weeks
01:21 < pielover88888> LOL
01:21 <@minus> it's a server though
01:21 <@minus> need to update gitlab tomorrow
01:22 <@minus> using system packages to install it was bad idea
01:22 < pielover88888> I'm actually hosting a server, too >.>
01:22 <@minus> i have several
01:23 <@minus> welp, half past one. time to sleep. haven't been up this late in quite a while
01:23 < pielover88888> Good night :D
01:23 < pielover88888> sleep tight and don't let the bugs make you download a nightly XD
02:00 < pielover88888> hello fisted

14:41 < heinrich5991> apparantly rendered by servo
14:41 < EastByte> cool
14:42 < EastByte> I'm not into rust, but servo is the html dom renderer written in it right?
14:45 < heinrich5991> yes, completely from scratch
14:50 <@minus> :|
14:52 < heinrich5991> minus: |:
14:54 < heinrich5991> that is, what do you mean?
14:55 <@minus> :/
14:55 <@minus> silly is what i mean
14:56 < heinrich5991> why?
14:56 < heinrich5991> there's basically just C++ browsers out there
16:20 < Siile> hi all
16:21 < Siile> can anyone tell me where (in source) the server define's clients ClientID?
16:24 < heinrich5991> Siile: where the number is set or what?
16:24 < Siile> yes
16:24 < Siile> when I connect to a server, I'm to get a ClientID
16:25 < Siile> trying to find that from the source
16:26 < heinrich5991> OnClientEnter or so
16:28 < Siile> nope, it's always like OnClientEnter(ClientID);
16:28 < heinrich5991> oh, that's what you mean
16:28 < heinrich5991> Siile: in CNetServer::Read()
16:30 < heinrich5991> Siile: CNetServer::Recv(). and search for "This server is full"
16:30 < heinrich5991> a bit above that
16:30 < Siile> thank you
16:40 < heinrich5991> about those cyclic data structures in TW
18:13 <@minus> like ringbuffers?
18:16 < heinrich5991> nah
18:16 < heinrich5991> I wanted to explain an idea of mine on how one could do these cyclic stuff in rust
18:16 < heinrich5991> (that stuff that components use the client and vice versa)
18:17 < PsychoGod> render one ?
18:18 < PsychoGod> for hud and other components ?
18:18 < pielover88888> Does the current 0.7 source for teeworlds include the new map-downloading thing? Like, you don't download it and then join, you join and download it and (sort of) play?
18:21 < heinrich5991> pielover88888: I don't know if the new map downloading stuff can do this. the new map downloading stuff however is not in the source
18:22 < pielover88888> I saw it in a demonstration youtube video, by matricks I believe. So, it can. I guess it's only in matricks's fork?
18:23 <@minus> pielover88888: that was just a demo matricks coded, never made it into teeworlds
18:24 < pielover88888> oh, that's a shame.
18:26 <@minus> https://github.com/matricks/teeworlds/commits/ressys
19:32 < BotoX> 2012, jesus
19:32 < BotoX> was it really this long ago
19:33 < pielover88888> apparently.
19:33 < pielover88888> so if someone donated like, a thousand euros to the project, do you think the devs would get to work again?
19:44 <@minus> if you seriously wanna get something going you'd have to hire a dev. a thousand euros wouldn't get you very far
19:46 < pielover88888> I just want 0.7 as buggy as 0.6.x (basically bugless) and have published binaries, since it's currently difficult to compile.
19:48 <@minus> it is?
20:59 < heinrich5991> pielover88888: tw has enough donations currently
21:00 < pielover88888> so what's the ETA on 0.7? Just kidding. xD
21:01 < heinrich5991> there's no ETA unfortunately
21:03 <@minus> l
21:04 <@minus> wrong window ;P
22:49 < heinrich5991> matricks: do you know enet?
