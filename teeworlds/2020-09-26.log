15:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> searching for a mapconverter from 0.7 to 0.6: i have found sb. who encodes maps in xml, how does it work? https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1986
15:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I can't find the link to a source or anything
15:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> seems like it takes the map and spits out a structured xml, using base64 encoded binary data for the tiles data
15:38 < ChillerDragon> omg that tool is awesome this is exectly what i was dreaming of since the last few years! seems to be very outdated tho
15:41 < ChillerDragon> there is a download link here https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=56946#p56946 @Assa
15:41 < ChillerDragon> please pick up the project and maintain it <3
15:41 < ChillerDragon> did maps change since 0.5? That was before my time o.O
15:44 < ChillerDragon> yo
15:44 < MalwareTele14> hi im chatting in a windows xp vm
15:44 < MalwareTele14> it works
15:44 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:45 < MalwareTele14> also windows xp cant run Teeworlds
15:45 < ChillerDragon> probably compiled with too new compilers try a older version
15:45 < ChillerDragon> or compile it yourself
15:45 < MalwareTele14> i will download the oldest teeworlds
15:46 < ChillerDragon> i think some 0.6.1 should be working already
15:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @ChillerDragon if I find out how this tool works, I will do it and make maps convertable over 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8
15:46 < ChillerDragon> omg yes pls
15:47 < ChillerDragon> imagine tracking map changes in a git diff as xml changes
15:47 < ChillerDragon> its my wet dream
15:48 < MalwareTheTele1> is there any better web browser for windows xp
15:48 < ChillerDragon> lynx
15:49 < ChillerDragon> why xp tho?
15:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> firefoxx works I think MalwareTele14
15:51 < MalwareTheTele1> internet explorer is bad it cannot let me download
15:51 < ChillerDragon> yo @heinrich5991 i give u 5 bucks if u rewrite map2xml in rust :)
15:51 < MalwareTheTele1> im downloading from my main pc chrome
15:52 < ChillerDragon> or map2json if u have to use cool kids tech
15:52 < ChillerDragon> seems like xp crashed xd
15:53 < MalwareTele14> no
15:53 < MalwareTele14> i was having problems
15:53 < ChillerDragon> oh it was ur host?
15:53 < MalwareTele14> no
15:53 < ChillerDragon> why are you playing around with xp?
15:53 < MalwareTele14> i just had alot of irc clients running in background
15:53 < MalwareTele14> because its fun to expirement
15:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You are in luck, I'll rewrite it for you, for the loow low price of 15 euros per hour with a minimum billable hours of 4
15:54 < MalwareTele14> lol i tried mIRC because Hexchat does not work
15:54 < MalwareTele14> :)
15:56 < ChillerDragon> really @Learath2?
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is there anyone willing to properly document the map format or to explain how the map format works?
15:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> also wanted to do some tools for maps in Go
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://github.com/heinrich5991/libtw2/blob/f3bc91564d06ffae2df385f5db0fdad4ed4d28b1/doc/datafile.md
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> starting point with the data files
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: Nah, don't have the time, was just wondering whether you'd be interested in paying üòÑ
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> bruh, ‚ù§Ô∏è love
15:57 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 i would for sure
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> now I'm a little bit motivated
15:57 < ChillerDragon> 60 bucks for a fully functional map to txt and back tool
15:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> libtw2 would be a very quick way to get this made, @heinrich5991 already has most of the parsing ready there I think
15:58 < ChillerDragon> yea
15:58 < ChillerDragon> thats why i mentioned rust
15:58 < ChillerDragon> i would even double
15:58 < ChillerDragon> i pay 120
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> oof, for 60 bucks it's starting to become interesting
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> üòÑ
15:58 < ChillerDragon> so?
15:58 < MalwareTele14> what
15:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> but this is usually the point where the people giving it has lots of unspoken demands
15:58 < ChillerDragon> yes!
15:58 < ChillerDragon> xd
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: What would you use this for anyway? Doesn't sound useful to me at all
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> chillerdragon needs to properly and IMMUTABLY write down the demanded functionality
15:59 < MalwareTele14> chrome in windows xp i know it would lag
15:59 < ChillerDragon> what i expect for 120 is it is working easy to compile and works error less with 0.6 and 0.7 with embedded and external mapres etc 
15:59 < ChillerDragon> like just a good tool
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> rust easy to compile
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> üòÑ
15:59 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 track maps in git
16:00 < MalwareTele14> because i gave the machine 256 mb of ram
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> I'd be willing to do it for 60 bucks, as I currently understand it. but I won't steal it from someone else if someone else wants to do it
16:00 < ChillerDragon> i guess learath is ur only competition
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: the tool wasn't useful for maps differing in the tiles
16:00 < ChillerDragon> assa wanted to do it for free xd
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> it just encoded the tiles as binary data
16:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> fine by me
16:00 < ChillerDragon> oh wait
16:00 < ChillerDragon> i thought the tiles are in xml?
16:00 < MalwareTele14> what teeworlds version would work on windows xp
16:01 < ChillerDragon> did u try 0.6.1
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah interesting
16:01 < MalwareTele14> chrome is still downloading
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> a later version had the tiles in XML, too
16:01 < ChillerDragon> i want no base64 or other binary encoding other than images
16:01 < ChillerDragon> yes
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I would really love those libtw2 readmes to be officially added to the teeworlds repository, as that is quite  alot of documentation there.
16:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yea, fine by me
16:01 < ChillerDragon> but images could stay images as well
16:01 < ChillerDragon> no need to encode images
16:02 < ChillerDragon> so i want to see all changes like tiles position envelopes metadata like author license etc in readable txt form
16:02 < ChillerDragon> that then could be used to audit map diffs without opening the editor
16:02 < ChillerDragon> ddnet map fixed would benefit from that when accepting pacthes by untrusted mappers
16:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Do you want it to support the ddnet extensions?
16:02 < ChillerDragon> give me all
16:02 < ChillerDragon> wait whats that
16:02 < ChillerDragon> oh sure
16:02 < ChillerDragon> ye tele etc
16:03 < ChillerDragon> thats actually important good point
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> aha, first unspoken assumption
16:03 < ChillerDragon> sry
16:03 < ChillerDragon> just assume i want it all
16:03 < ChillerDragon> so who is in?
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> for 60 bucks
16:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> nice
16:04 < ChillerDragon> 120
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *takes half, runs away*
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> If only I had the time for it
16:04 < ChillerDragon> oh cmn
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> xD
16:04 < MalwareTele14> its close
16:04 < ChillerDragon> is it only me with endless time?
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> You already have @heinrich5991, he is usually much more thorough than me anyway üòÑ
16:05 < ChillerDragon> i could even give u some of my time @Learath2
16:05 < ChillerDragon> mimimi
16:05 < MalwareTele14> hi @Dune
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: It's that I'm shit with managing time. So I allocate time in huuuge blocks instead
16:05 < ChillerDragon> but heinrich is afraight of my hidden feature requests
16:05 < ChillerDragon> i see
16:05 <@Dune> hi MalwareTele14
16:05 <@Dune> what do you want?
16:06 < MalwareTele14> Im in windows xp @Dune
16:06 < ChillerDragon> yo learath i can come over and mown ur lawn and then u have time right?
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> e.g. I'll be studying math the entirety of monday. Will probably only study about 3 hours of it, but If I said I'd study 3 hours of math on monday, I'd probably never get it done
16:06 <@Dune> consider upgrading as your system is vulnerable MalwareTele14
16:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I don't have a lawn :/
16:06 < ChillerDragon> see no lawn no problem
16:06 < MalwareTele14> no its a vm @Dune
16:06 < ChillerDragon> heinrich probably also studiyng
16:06 <@Dune> okay, what about it MalwareTele14?
16:07 < ChillerDragon> yo @heinrich5991 u in with probably a few more unspoken requests?
16:07 < MalwareTele14> im expermineting
16:07 <@Dune> what do you want from me?
16:07 < MalwareTele14> nothing
16:07 < ChillerDragon> lol
16:07 < MalwareTele14> i just see that you are freindley
16:07 < ChillerDragon> Dune is actually nice
16:08 < MalwareTele14> yea hes good
16:08 <@Dune> please don't ping me if you have nothing to say
16:08 < ChillerDragon> so pissed xd
16:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Was just about to say not for long if you randomly ping him üòÑ
16:08 < ChillerDragon> thats actually rude
16:08 < MalwareTele14> oh
16:08 < ChillerDragon> :GWPingSok:
16:08 < ChillerDragon> still no discord emotes huh?
16:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> :GWpingSock:
16:09 < MalwareTele14> it was close to crash windows xp
16:10 < MalwareTele14> its laggy
16:10 < MalwareTele14> because i installed chrome
16:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, I'll take a look later ChillerDragon
16:10 < ChillerDragon> awesome
16:10 < MalwareTele14> ok ill be back 
16:10 < MalwareTele14> bye
16:10 < ChillerDragon> bye
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> Doctor: ChillerDragon does not exist, dragons are not real
17:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> ChillerDragon with a hyper excited look: map2xml pls.
17:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> btw. ChillerDragon just now used Discord again.
18:26 < ChillerDragon> i see no benefit in discord over irc
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> Chillerdragon: sounds like an iteresting project. is xml2map in that request, or is that another project?
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> woah„ÄÇportable map format
19:01 < ChillerDragon> @Patiga yea when u started around w maps i hoped it could be the foundation of that
19:02 < ChillerDragon> map2xml is a project from 2008 that could be nice but i guess its better to let heinrich rewrite it in rust
19:03 < ChillerDragon> well doesnt has to be rust tho @heinrich5991 i just thought u have stuff there already and u like it. Im also fine with C/C++ and shell.
19:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Patiga> ChillerDragon: what i dont quite get yet is if you want to convert .map files into a human readable format, or also the other way around
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> > assa wanted to do it for free xd
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @[quakenet] ChillerDragon#0000 maybe for 59 bucks
20:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> just say `ChillerDragon: ` to notify him on IRC
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Patiga the goal is to be able to convert any map format into an intermediate representation like xml or json and back in order to be able to port maps over different teeworlds versions
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon never clarified whether back as well
20:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> > [6:45 PM] Patiga: [‚Ä¶] is xml2map in that request, or is that another project?
20:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ah I guess ChillerDragon didn't understand what was being asked
21:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <a gerdoe> why doesn't teeworlds use xml format for maps? due to size of files?
21:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <TsFreddie> binary is generally smaller than plaintext i think
