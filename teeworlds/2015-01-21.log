22:07 < LittleWhite> jxsl13: Ask anything you want, we will try to answer (at least me, but I am not the best placed for that, so I will try :p )
22:07 < jxsl13> l/etc/init.d/uptee: line 14: /root/uptee: Is a directory
22:09 < jxsl13> UPTEEPATH=/path/to/virtualenv  line 12
22:09 < jxsl13> $UPTEEPATH/uptee $1 line 14
22:09 < jxsl13> the path is ~/uptee
22:09 < LittleWhite> ~/uptee gives /root/uptee ?
22:10 < LittleWhite> on your compurter ? you are all working using root account ?

22:25 < LittleWhite> ah yeah, right :)
22:25 < LittleWhite> Well done ;)
22:34 < nuborn> hi, is the bam.lua script aware of what options bam was called with? like the -c option
22:36 < nuborn> or is there any way to get that option inside bam.lua when compiling teeworlds?
22:39 <@matricks> not the specific -c flags etc
22:39 <@matricks> but you can push specific variables into bam
22:39 <@matricks> like.. bam myVar=hello
22:39 <@matricks> nuborn: what do you want to do?
22:42 < nuborn> matricks: I wondered if there was a way to make "bam -c" delete not just the regular targets, but also other files like config.lua
22:42 <@matricks> I don't think so
22:43 <@matricks> compile targets are setup after the script is executed
22:44 <@matricks> and arguments to bam isn't pushed into the script except the explicit var=arg style
22:44 <@matricks> it can cause some weird issues if a script can react to arbitrary arguments
22:44 < nuborn> ok, I see
22:45 <@matricks> the whole config.lua is a bit.. well.. weird and could be integrated better
22:45 <@matricks> and I don't think you want to reconfigure just because you cleaned
22:48 < nuborn> yes, maybe not
