13:13 < ChillerDragon> Why is ``CGameClient::SendSkinChange()`` using ``MSGFLAG_FLUSH`` ?
20:22 < rand> related github discussion/issue/commit : https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2063 (might be a copy/past from the SendStartInfo tho)
23:31 < seabass> ChillerDragon: your CTF server is still going strong :)  Thank you for running it. 
23:51 < bridge> <Dune> Oh is it? Damn gj chillerdragon
23:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> The copy paste I suspect too. But I do not see yet how the issue relates. I’m just curious why something like a skin info gets flushed like a time critical message. If even things like that get flushed why even bother adding the concept of flushing to the code base. But I assume I’m missing something.

23:57 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea nice to hear. I don‘t really launch 0.7 clients so I barley know how it does. Other than the occasional email a player sends me \:D
23:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yo Seabass you are not the Bass guy from 12 years ago are you? xd
