12:34 < nameless_tee90> hey, i'm trying to compile a modded 0.6 version with bam 4 and i receive a warning: "LINK : warning LNK4044: unrecognized option '/ldl';" leading to bam throwing an error at very end of compiling (140/141). I'm new to compiling tw and I just wanted to know if this is an issue with my setup or could it be related to an mistake in the sourcecode? The official version compiled just fine.
12:34 < nameless_tee90> it's at step #1 link teeworlds_d.exe
12:42 < minus> nameless_tee90: /ldl probably is intended to link the dl library which is required for loading libraries at runtime. vanilla teeworlds doesn't make use of that mechanism. it's usually used for plugin systems.
12:48 < nameless_tee90> minus: so how would I fix this? Am i missing some dependencies on my system or is it strictly related to something missing in the src? 
12:49 < minus> i don't know how that stuff works with the MSVC++ compiler/linker, but my bet's on the build process for windows for that mod being broken
12:54 < nameless_tee90> okay, thank you for the time
