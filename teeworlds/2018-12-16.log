13:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> hi, what is the point of "sv_strict_spectate_mode" and what are the values
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> check out game/variables.h to know the values
13:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> `MACRO_CONFIG_INT(SvStrictSpectateMode, sv_strict_spectate_mode, 0, 0, 1, CFGFLAG_SAVE|CFGFLAG_SERVER, "Restricts information in spectator mode")`
13:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> default=0 min=0 max=1
13:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> what are informations in spectator mode?
13:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> server join/leave msgs? health data?
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> There's now "sv_silent_spectator_mode" to silence join/leave messages by spectators.
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> btw
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok good to know
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i still don't know what strict spectate mode is
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> health, armor, ammo
13:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok
13:36 < Oy> health armor ammo
13:37 < Oy> when following a player
13:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok cool... will update this in the docu
13:37 <@Dune> thank u
14:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> is there a way to copy sdl.dll and freetype.sdl with bam or is this always a manual task?
14:36 <@Dune> huh
14:36 <@Dune> it's not copied?
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> no not with .\bam\bam conf=release -f
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> new compiling doku for windows with vs
14:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> https://github.com/Fisico/tw-test-doku/blob/master/compiling_everything_new.md
14:39 < minus> *cough*
14:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ðŸ˜„
14:40 < minus> a certain someone though that putting dlls into the repo and copying them around is a bad thing to do and removed them when changing the build scripts
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> hard to structure the compiling stuff.
14:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> Minus is it possible to split the compiling stuff in 3 files, Windows, linux and mac?
14:44 <@Dune> the compiling stuff?
14:44 <@Dune> ah you mean the bam script?
14:45 < minus> (the certain someone was me btw)
14:45 < minus> i think he means the docs
14:45 < minus> i guess you can since there's not any actual work that's common to all platforms
14:45 < minus> wait, didn't heinrich5991 change it to CMake?
14:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> yea i mean the docs
14:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i dont know how the CMake stuff works ðŸ˜„
14:50 < minus> hm, not CMake stuff in the repo, so maybe i'm wrong then
14:59 <@Dune> minus: it's still in PR
15:05 < minus> holy fuck, a 1800 line CMakeLists.txt
15:05 < minus> what the fuck did you do there, heinrich5991
15:06 < minus> half of that are file lists D:
15:10 <@Dune> @LordSk
15:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I've already asked on the PR
15:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> apparently this has something to do with CMakeLists.txt file not changing when you add a file to the source tree
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> so you don't know if you need to run cmake again
15:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> when using file search instead of listing all of them
15:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I've never had this issue before, I thought this was a common way of doing it. Files are added/removed? Run cmake again, not a hard concept.
15:15 <@Dune> bam doesn't have this problem though
15:15 <@Dune> does it?
15:16 <@Dune> u constantly add/remove files when u switch branch
15:18 < minus> i think just running make again updates the cmake shit too
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> if CMakeLists has changed yeah
15:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> hence the "issue"
15:19 < minus> hm
15:19 < minus> on one hand, having a fixed list of things is good, on the other hand it's not nice to have this long ass list in there
15:20 < minus> tbh building teeworlds shouldn't be more than 200 lines of cmake
15:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> and running cmake again is really quick
15:21 < minus> unlike gradle
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> question for the mac guys... what libraries, and dependencies are necessary for mac compiling?
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> same as linux?
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> python
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> alsa (asound)
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> gl
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> glu
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> x11
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> libsdl
16:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> freetype
16:29 < minus> x11 shouldn't be needed there
16:29 < minus> as well as alsa
16:29 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok
16:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> gl and glu?
16:31 < minus> those are required, but no idea if they just come with the system already
16:31 < Oy> u just have to install sdl2 and freetype
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> and xcode
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok
16:32 < Oy> yeah and the development tools it provides
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> where do i download freetype for mac?
16:32 < Oy> i'd suggest using brew
16:33 < Oy> brew.sh
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> sdl also via brw?
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> *brew?
16:34 < Oy> yeah
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> so brew will place it in library/frameworks?
16:35 < Oy> no
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> brew install sdl2 it is right?
16:35 < Oy> tw will find it
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ok cool
16:35 < Oy> yeah
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> writing the docu
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> atm
16:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> python is also needed on mac
16:45 < Oy> should be installed already
16:46 < Oy> python2 is already installed with macos
17:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> ah ok
17:47 < Teeworlds> [documentation] Fisico opened pull request #17: Added missing server commands and updated compiling everything (master...master) https://git.io/fpND6
17:51 < Oy> the -f isn't necessary
18:04 <@Dune> avira said "analysis complete, clean"
18:04 <@Dune> maybe it'll stop detecting it as a false positive
18:05 < minus> reminder to not use avira or other antivirus products; stick to windows defender
18:05 <@Dune> the problem is a lot of people seem to :x
18:06 < minus> i recently uninstalled *two* AV programs from a windows pc
18:06 <@Dune> huh lol
18:06 < minus> at least windows defender seems to disable itself when other AV products are there
18:09 < Oy> windows defender is pretty good these days - no need for additional av products anymore
18:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> yeah
18:43 < Oy> Landil would like to participate at the 0.8 meeting
18:44 < Oy> asked for a specific time
18:44 <@Dune> nice
18:44 <@Dune> is minus interested?
18:44 < Oy> told him we have no specific time yet and he should tell me when it suits best for him
18:44 <@Dune> yeah
18:45 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> Oy: btw i'm working on the editor
18:46 < Oy> good :)
18:46 < Oy> don't mess sth up :P
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> I hope that's okay with everyone
18:46 < Oy> sure
18:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <LordSk> great
18:51 <@Dune> what about the version server btw?
18:57 < Oy> minus can you set a dns record for it? and set one up?
18:58 < Oy> i'd like to do a christmas version (0.7.2)
18:58 <@Dune> that'd be nice
18:58 <@Dune> it's a bit of a race
18:58 <@Dune> 9 days in, shortly after the meeting
18:59 <@Dune> would be nice to pimp teeworlds.com just a lil bit for xmas btw :)
18:59 < Oy> don't have to do everything from the current 0.7.2 milestone for it
18:59 <@Dune> I see
18:59 < Oy> yeah :D
19:00 < Oy> ingame tees should wear xmas hats :D
19:00 <@Dune> that'd be great :D
19:00 <@Dune> but i think decoration are placed behind tees
19:00 <@Dune> should https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1630 be tagged graphics?
19:00 < Oy> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=12361
19:01 <@Dune> not sure how doable this is with the current system
19:01 < Oy> would render the hats in front of the decoration
19:01 <@Dune> oh :)
19:01 < Oy> no biggie
19:01 <@Dune> that'd be awesome
19:01 < Oy> need hat image :D
19:01 < Oy> images 
19:01 <@Dune> @Sonix might still have the svg
19:02 <@Dune> that's a great idea :p
19:02 <@Dune> maybe open a topic in https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewforum.php?id=21
19:02 < Oy> yeah
19:03 < Oy> added graphics labe to it
19:05 <@Dune> btw can you rehost https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=122195#p122195
19:06 < Oy> hm, probably because it's a draft
19:06 <@Dune> I'd like to review https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation/pull/17 too btw, in a while
19:06 <@Dune> I guess yeah
19:06 <@Dune> drafts are private
19:07 <@Dune> @Fisico ^
19:08 < Oy> yeah, but thought the direct links for the assets still work
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> dune ?
19:09 < Oy> when i add it to the description it works :)
19:10 <@Dune> @Fisico I'll review the doc changes too, if you don't mind
19:10 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> sure
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Fisico> i still don't know what target content is doing ðŸ˜„
19:16 < Oy> opened a topic :P
19:18 <@Dune> nice
19:18 <@Dune> did some client changes, accidentally broke nethash, lol
19:18 <@Dune> was testing in the metro with a local server, so I didn't notice for long :x
19:23 <@Dune> ah, sounds change the nethash Oo
19:23 <@Dune> ah, right
19:23 < Oy> :P
19:24 <@Dune> it's a bit strange, I mean, sounds like the music aren't sent over the protocol
19:24 <@Dune> but ok :P
19:28 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/datasrc/network.py#L230
19:31 <@Dune> ahh, thanks
