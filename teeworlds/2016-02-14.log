11:41 < Obani> yo
11:48 <@heinrich5991> hi
17:26 < Teectac> hello
17:27 < Teectac> i'm trying to implement client-side autospectate
17:27 < Teectac> any ideas when to send the msg ?
17:28 <@matricks> split players into islands and then center the camera on the players that seems more intressting
17:38 < Teectac> why()->so()->much()->abstraction(???) :(
17:38 <@matricks> ?
17:39 < Teectac> i'm lost in all these interfaces
17:39 <@matricks> lol
17:39 <@matricks> teeworlds is built in 3 layers, base, engine and game
17:40 <@matricks> and the interfaces sit between the engine and game
17:40 <@matricks> it's not that much abstraction :)
17:41 < Teectac> where would you send a CNetMsg_Cl_SetSpectatorMode to spectate as soon as connected ?
17:42 <@matricks> think the client gets called when the engine is done establishing the connection
17:42 < Teectac> i tried OnEnterGame with no luck on both CClient and CGameClient
17:43 <@matricks> too early
17:44 <@matricks> OnStateChange
17:44 <@matricks> when the client switches state to online
17:49 < Teectac> still no luck 
17:52 <@matricks> well, dunno
17:55 < Teectac> maybe if i kill myself the right way i'll go to the spectator paradize ^^
17:55 < Teectac> [56c0b162][game]: kill killer='0:Teectac' victim='0:Teectac' weapon=-3 special=0
17:57 < rand> on join, the team is set by the server
18:03 < Teectac> yep
18:20 < rand> I have just tried join spec in OnEnterGame, and it worked
18:22 < rand> Teectac: http://ix.io/onH
18:23 < rand> i don't know what could happen when watching a demo though
18:24 < Teectac> oh but u used sendswitchteam
18:31 < Teectac> thanks rand :)
18:31 <@matricks> I need food
18:31  * rand throws a cookie to matricks
18:31 <@matricks> NO COOKIES!
18:32 < Teectac> is it famine in germany already ?
18:32  * rand takes back his cookie
18:41 < Teectac> this->object()->oriented()->heresy[i]->has.to->stop();
18:43 <@matricks> Teectac: how would you like to structure the code?
19:08 < Teectac> matricks: no idea, its just too big for me to refactor
19:16 < Teectac> matricks: if u could rewrite it from scratch, what would you do differently abt the structure ?
19:16 <@matricks> a couple of things
19:16 <@matricks> I would make the splits harder and put more glue between them
19:17 <@matricks> to remove dependencies between systems
19:17 <@matricks> make sure that the IKernel goes away
19:19 <@matricks> and probably not written it in C++ :)
19:22 < Teectac> :)
19:23 < Teectac> i tried to transcode the server to nodejs
19:23 <@matricks> noo
19:23 <@matricks> js is a horrible language
19:24 < Teectac> lol, agreed, and that thing 
19:24 < urraka> what would you replace c++ with?
19:24 < Teectac> has almost no support for blocking io
19:24 <@matricks> urraka: rust
19:25 < urraka> i see. haven't tried it myself but looks interesting
19:26 < Teectac> another braces nightmare ?! long live python !
19:26 <@matricks> horrible language of games as well
19:27 <@heinrich5991> Teectac: does it really matter whether you use python vs c block syntax?
19:27 <@matricks> thats just shed paint so
19:27 < Teectac> heinrich5991: i hate the ; as well
19:28 < urraka> as long as it's not pascal-like block syntax.. :P
19:28 <@matricks> meh, I don't care about stuff like that
19:28 <@matricks> like I said, thats just shed paint
19:29 < urraka> i dont care much either, but makes things harder to see
19:29 < Teectac> what abt nim ?
19:30 <@matricks> not looked that much into it
19:33 <@matricks> I like rust just because of how it handles memory
19:33 <@matricks> for me thats the killer feature of it
20:49 <@minus> oh, there's a spy *points to urraka*
20:49 <@matricks> minus: ? :D
20:49 <@minus> he's affiliated with Soldat
20:49 <@matricks> omg!
20:50 <@matricks> Care-o-meter: [-           ]
20:52 < Teectac> is he blond, badass sword on his back ?
21:11 < urraka> spy? lol
