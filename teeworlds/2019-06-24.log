15:29 < Learath2> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/commit/cae8c68d we used to use this "hack" to improve the map download speed before switching over to http, it worked pretty well
15:30 < Learath2> I don't really remember a reflection using the map downloads
16:05 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> http map download is beast o.O
16:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Maybe we could implement a public map database into master servers to support http download.
16:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well sounds like work stporage place and attack vector all struggel nobody wants to go through.
16:08 < Dune> you don't need a centralized database to have http download 
16:38 < Edible> how come?
16:39 < Dune> you can just have the servers give http?
17:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh true BrainDragon didnt think of that xd
17:07 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> sure the servers it self could do that. Idk how i didnt think of that. I wonder why ddnet does it this way. Do they even? xd
19:42 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Dune you could easily just give a server Http and a websocket - I am not sure you asked for that
20:04 < redix> you could just increase sv_map_download_speed
20:11 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @Dune i wanted to bind statboard on shift+tab and i have scoreboard on tab and emote on shift. Doesn't this combination work?
20:12 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I expected to press shift+tab to get emote and statboard but i got emote and scoreboard
20:19 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah I don't think it works if you use lshift
20:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> SAD
20:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> woops caps
20:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also taking a screenshot of the statboard with my f4 bind didnt work either
21:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Oy when should the statboard not reset? On a new round? I don't even know rounds lol
22:39 < redix> rounds only exist in survival
22:40 < redix> your pr only resets after a match but not after a round (which is correct) but i'm pretty sure that it does not reset after a restart
22:43 < redix> other problems with the statboard: stats are not reset when a new player enters the slot (works only in demos), FPM value should only consider the time you were really ingame, kills and deaths in scoreboard and statboard differ sometimes
22:43 < redix> and serverside stat support would be cool
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no it doesnt reset after restart
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> because the client doesnt know about restart
22:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im not sure if we should introduce a gamestateflag for that
22:49 < redix> here is the code from ddnet:
22:49 < redix> V
22:49 < redix> https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/6e24bf9ae2de83ee568647c77ac9fc979b00ab98/src/game/client/gameclient.cpp#L1266-L1274
22:50 < redix> works for restart aswell but it is a bit hacky
22:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> so they restart on round
22:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> do we want to restart on new round?
22:50 < redix> and this would reset on round aswell
22:51 < redix> so you would have to add an additional check for the roundover state
22:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yes i was thinking about that
22:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but i didnt even know what rounds are haha
22:51 < redix> makes it even more hackish =\
22:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea
22:51 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> i think rounds can be seen as feature
22:52 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but restart should reset it. And the client doesn know about restart. And i guess adding a gamestateflag would be more of an 0.8 thing
22:52 < redix> thats why the ddnet code checks for the tick instead of the flag
22:53 < redix> tick is reset in restart
22:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea thats ugly
22:59 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> wont implement that for vanilla
