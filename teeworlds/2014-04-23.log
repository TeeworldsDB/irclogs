10:33 < toil> matricks: fu
10:34 < toil> he broke my srv or something
10:34 < toil> i can't ssh in lol
10:34 <@matricks> :P
10:34 < toil> but everyone else can connect :@
15:25 < dtsf> toil: did you firewall yourself again? 
15:25  * dtsf is fisted (and i haven't logged on to your dedi in a while)
15:26 < dtsf> FWIW i can login just fine
15:26 <@minus> inb4 fail2ban
15:28 < dtsf> doesn't look like it
15:28 < dtsf> also, iptables is clear
15:28  * dtsf goes check logs
15:29 < Savander> Hey! i got question. When i want show hp, all working for alive players but, for spectators or for dead players, server getting crashes.. I made selection statement (if,else) like that: if(GetCharacter()->GetPlayer()->GetTeam() != TEAM_SPECTATORS && GetCharacter()->GetHealth() >= 1) (in player.cpp where sended "broadcast" with health)  Someone knows, why it's not working?
15:30 < Savander> It's a bit annoying :d
15:30 < Savander> maybe its wrong statement?
15:31 < dtsf> Savander: GetCharacter() may well return NULL
15:31 < dtsf> (and you're dereferencing it unconditionally)
15:34 < Savander> before this i have " if(GetCharacter())"
15:34 < BotoX> >GetCharacter()->GetPlayer()
15:34 < BotoX> Are you calling this from player.cpp?
15:34 < Savander> yes
15:34 < BotoX> luuuuuulululululululul
15:34 <@minus> welp
15:34 < BotoX> You already have the player object
15:35 < BotoX> Just do GetTeam() to check the team and GetCharacter() or m_IsAlive to see wether the character actually exists
15:35 < BotoX> eg. wether it is possible for him to have HP
15:35 < Savander> oh okay
15:36 < Savander> sorry, im i'm reading this code (teeworlds code) about 2 days :D
15:37 < Savander> And i'm learning c++ ^^
15:37 < Savander> sorry ;3
15:38 <@minus> well, at least you didn't drown it, jumping into the deep end of the pool without knowing how to swim
15:39 < BotoX> u wot
15:39 < BotoX> m9
15:39 < dtsf> toil: show me the output of ssh -vvv root@yourdedi
15:39 < Savander> Previously was programming in PHP, maybe not in high level but..
15:39  * dtsf wonders how anything on that server even remotely works
15:39 < dtsf> can't program in php 'high-level' anyway
15:40 < dtsf> it's just a matter of the brain becoming less and less functional, given prolonged exposure to PHP
15:40  * dtsf runs off to mysql_real_escape_string() some strings
15:44 < BotoX> pls add your server to my botnet, tyvm
15:49 < Savander> BotoX, working :) Thanks.
15:53 <@minus> BotoX: plz gib access
15:54 < BotoX> I don't actually have a botnet :(
15:54 < BotoX> Just access to a bunch of servers
15:54 <@minus> awww
15:54 < BotoX> Though, I guess that's around 20gbit
15:55 <@minus> i have dedicated 100mbit/s. that's all, not counting the shared ones
15:55 <@minus> also, waiting about 10-20 seconds to see what i actually type on irc
15:55 <@minus> dat interrwebs
15:55 < BotoX> lol
15:55 < BotoX> wtf you doing
15:55 <@minus> colleague is uploading shit
15:55 <@minus> aand we have a consumer grade router
15:56 < BotoX> Just compiled nginx with a bunch of extra modules on a 12 core
15:56 < BotoX> that was quick.
15:56 <@minus> pls
16:13 < BotoX> lets compile hhvm on it, I guess
16:24 < BotoX> ooop went out of RAM!
16:35 <@minus> how little ram do you have?
16:38 < BotoX> only 4GB on that VM
16:38 < BotoX> host has 72GB
16:41 <@minus> welp
16:54 < Siile> tee defence up and running, 2 slots left
16:54 < Siile> password: siile
16:57 < Edible> defense?
16:59 < BotoX> de fence
20:32  * minus np: Dane, Booze Design - Dane vs Danko
21:24 < ghost91> hi
21:25 <@minus> hiho ghost91
21:25 < ghost91> what’s up?
21:25 <@minus> the ceiling
21:26 < ghost91> haha
21:26 < ghost91> :D
21:26 < EastBite> looks like he got it :D haha
21:29 < JulianAssange> k
21:30 < ghost91> is there any chance we’ll see some stuff being done sooner than later? :D
21:32 <@minus> NEVAR!
21:35 <@matricks> :P
21:49 < yemDX`> teeworlds 0.9.0 has alreayd been released in china
22:00 < ghost91> well, I mean, there are 28 pullrequests
22:00 < ghost91> probably at least half of them do really usefull things
22:01 < ghost91> mayn have been revised by othe people
22:01 < ghost91> many*
22:02 < ghost91> I don’t see any reason, why we do not simply merge that stuff..
22:02 <@matricks> well, someone has todo it
22:03 <@minus> verify code for sanity + merge + test
22:03 <@minus> x28
22:03 <@minus> my pull request should be reworked though
22:04 < ghost91> hmm
22:04 < ghost91> well, is there nobody, who could do that?
22:04 < ghost91> I know it’s currently Oy’s job, but he just seems to be inactive
22:05 < JulianAssange> .
22:06 < ghost91> it’s also quite frustrating to work on tw at all at the moment, because it’s hard to tell, what needs to be done
22:07 <@matricks> I don't think there is anyone who has the engine to drive the project personally
22:08 < ghost91> there is so much done already in pullrequests, and it’s difficult to filter that out
22:08 < ghost91> new issues are not even being tagged...
22:09 < ghost91> hmmm
22:09 <@matricks> as I said, think the drive is missing
22:10 < ghost91> well, the problem is, the people who have the time and dedication to do it, (think they) are not capable of doing it
22:12 < ghost91> I don’t know if I misjudge things here, but I think people like heinrich5991, SushiTee or cinera could do a great job at pushing things ahead.
22:12 <@matricks> perhaps let them have commit access then
22:12 < ghost91> You are right, the drive is missing, but in my opinion, it’s just because nothing happens in the main repo
22:13 <@matricks> and nothing ahppens in the main repo because the drive is missing, not the other way around
22:13 < ghost91> well, I think that’s only partially true
22:13 < ghost91> a lot of great things have already been sone
22:13 < ghost91> done*
22:13 < ghost91> like SDL2 stuff
22:14 < ghost91> there’s a lot
22:15 < ghost91> there are quite a few developers, who would like to push things ahead, but just are not able to do so beacause of the state of the main repo
22:16 < ghost91> it’s not really motivating to see 28 pullrequests, which have been there for ages
22:16 < ghost91> and the last commit being from 2 months ago
22:16 < ghost91> well
22:16 < ghost91> whatever
22:16 < ghost91> I just thought I’d leave my 2 cents here ;)
22:17 < ghost91> I hope all the evolves positively
22:17 <@minus> http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/I_did_it_for_you_all
22:17 <@matricks> well, perhaps some more with commit access could be good, dunno
22:17 <@matricks> dunno who has it
22:17 < ghost91> minus + Oy I think
22:17 < ghost91> ?
22:17 < heinrich5991> yea, I think so too
22:17 <@matricks> there is a lot of code that needs clean up in the codebase as well
22:17 < heinrich5991> yea :(
22:18 <@minus> i has access
22:18 < ghost91> hmm
22:18 < ghost91> well, it would be a good idea to think about all this
22:18 < ghost91> and especially, if there are any persons, who could do the job
22:20 < ghost91> I think at the moment it’s hard to get an overview of what needs to be done, especially in codebase
22:21 < ghost91> but whatever…
22:21 < ghost91> just think about it, maybe we can improve the current situation
22:21 < ghost91> well, I need to go now, there are more important things now
22:21 < ghost91> cya :)
22:21  * matricks is looking through some push commits
22:38 < JulianAssange> i support heinrich5991 
22:38 < JulianAssange> for commiter of main repo
22:46 <@matricks> argh... I need to know german
22:47 < JulianAssange> seig heil matricks 
22:47 < JulianAssange> fick fick seig heil!
22:47 <@matricks> too much of that latly
22:47 <@minus> :D
22:48 <@minus> matricks: geh mit mir ein bier trinken!
22:48 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: it's *sieg
22:48 < heinrich5991> not seig
22:49 <@matricks> there was a.. well.. issue with paragliding in austria last year, but I can't find any updated information about it
22:49 < JulianAssange> wanna fight
