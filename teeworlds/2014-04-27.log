11:30 < ghost91> yo
11:30 < ghost91> good morning
11:43 <@minus> ghost91 pls
15:47 < SumoManu> Hey Guys
15:53 <@minus> aloha
15:59 < SumoManu> I have one question to the server refresh button. When you push it (menus_browser.cpp) then the Refresh function in serverbrowser.cpp is called (Type = TYPE_INTERNET) but there the m_NeedRefresh value is set to 1 and nothing else happens so how it does the refresh? Have i chosen the wrong way? 
16:00 < BotoX> I think the engine is refreshing the servers
16:00 < BotoX> and the gamepart just tells it to refresh by setting the variable
16:01 < BotoX> just search for m_NeedRefresh in every file
16:01 < BotoX> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/search?q=m_NeedRefresh
16:02 < BotoX> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/fe49818093c7fd44ec2004ac605e46480189bc06/src/engine/client/serverbrowser.cpp#L628
16:02 < BotoX> obviously the search function on github is stupid today
16:03 < SumoManu> I´ve searched with my program also m_NeedRefresh with the same result
16:04 < BotoX> look at the last link I posted
16:04 < EastByte> wow, github supports searching through code
16:04 < BotoX> wow my server is having packetloss
16:04 < SumoManu> yes thank you ;D
16:05 < BotoX> looks like it's not the best though, EastByte 
16:05 < EastByte> ya
16:05 < BotoX> if(m_NeedRefresh is not found lel
16:05 < EastByte> ./src/engine/client/serverbrowser.cpp:597:if(m_NeedRefresh && !m_pMasterServer->IsRefreshing()
16:05 < BotoX> muh grep
16:06 < EastByte> very grep
20:11 < ghost91> Oy: do you have sdl installed via homebrew/macports?
20:11 < ghost91> sdl-config is not available on my system
20:12 < Oy> ghost91: homebrew yeah
20:12 < ghost91> so that’s the reason it’s working on your system and not on mine
20:13 < ghost91> do we want to switch from using the framework to installing sdl manually/by brew/port ?
20:13 < ghost91> because until now, we used the framework
20:15 < Oy> brew seems the simplest way
20:16 < ghost91> I’d suggest we make both possible?
20:17 <@minus> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1072 *hint hint*
20:17 < ghost91> well, the way it’s done in my pullrequest also makes both possible
20:18 < ghost91> it checks, if sdl-config is present
20:18 < ghost91> if yes, that will be used
20:18 < ghost91> otherwise, if the framework is present, that is used
20:20 < ghost91> well, actually, I don’t care
20:22 < ghost91> but I think it would be a good idea to leave it up to the perople, how they want to install sdl...
20:23 < BotoX> or you should just get a proper OS :^)
20:23 < Oy> using brew makes the whole thing equal to how we handle it on linux, prevents the overhead and people don't have have to dl/ copy stuff manually
20:23 < Oy> same with freetype
20:24 < ghost91> well, whatever
20:25 < ghost91> would have been nice to have the information, that we do not longer support using the framework…
20:25 < ghost91> ;)
20:26 < ghost91> minus: could you change that in the docs?
20:26 < Oy> well the compiling everything  doc could need an bigger update ;)
20:27 < jayden> Hi. I'm playing ddrace a lot and I always see people disappearing and then reappering at a different location (like a teleport)
20:28 <@minus> ghost91: https://github.com/teeworlds/documentation
20:28 < jayden> One told me anybody can do it and it's something like a bug. Does anybody know something about that?
20:28 <@minus> ghost91: if you update those, i will get them to deploy on teeworlds.com
20:28 < ghost91> minus: ok, I will
20:30 < Oy> ghost91: if you do, pls add freetype to the mac process as well :)
20:30 < ghost91> yeah, I will
20:30 < ghost91> I’ll just update make_release.py so it works with sdl installed via port/brew
20:30 < ghost91> maybe I’ll have time to update the docs then
20:32 < Oy> and on windows we should add mingw
20:35 < Oy> minus: about your bam.lua update - i'm not sure what to do with sdl/freetype on windows
20:52 < ghost91> Oy, minus: I don’t know how teeworlds is built on windows with MinGW, so somebody else will have to update that part in the docs
20:57 <@minus> Oy: it's really inconvenient on windows. it should just be in the doumentation where to acquire the necessary sources
21:31 < ghost91> Oy: the problem with doing it this way is that it makes it diffucult to create an app bundle that ships with the libraries
21:31 < ghost91> sdl depends on quite a few libraries, that are not present on a standard os x system
21:32 < ghost91> like libX11.6.dylib
21:32 < ghost91> we need to include those in this case
21:32 < ghost91> that’s not needed with the framework...
21:34 < ghost91> 	/opt/local/lib/libX11.6.dylib (compatibility version 10.0.0, current version 10.0.0)
21:34 < ghost91> 	/opt/local/lib/libXext.6.dylib (compatibility version 11.0.0, current version 11.0.0)
21:34 < ghost91> 	/opt/local/lib/libXrandr.2.dylib (compatibility version 5.0.0, current version 5.0.0)
21:34 < ghost91> 	/opt/local/lib/libXrender.1.dylib (compatibility version 5.0.0, current version 5.0.0)
21:34 < ghost91> these are all needed i guess...
21:54 <@minus> X11 on osx? :o
21:55 <@minus> getting this documentation to build is a pain
22:25 < ghost91> minus: yeahm there is X11 for os x
22:26 < ghost91> don’t know why sdl depends on it though..
22:33 < ghost91> I really think we should use the framework….
22:33 < ghost91> this creates so much pain for the app bundle...
22:35 < ghost91> because those libraries again depend on other libraries, and and and
22:35 < ghost91> we need to include them all….
22:37 < ghost91> at least when i install stuff with macports
22:37 < ghost91> dunno about brew
22:42 < ghost91> the problem also is, we don’t know what those guys are changing...
22:42 < ghost91> they might add dependencies in the future breaking our system again...
22:42 < ghost91> arghhh
22:44 < ghost91> "libSDL", "libfreetype", "libpng", "libX11", "libXext", "libXrandr", "libXrender", "libxcb", "libXau", "libXdmcp"
22:44 < ghost91> these are the libraries i need currently
22:44 < ghost91> ...
22:44 < ghost91> it does not work without any of them
22:44 < ghost91> ...
22:44 < heinrich5991> ghost91: I haven't heard all of it, could you give me a short version?
22:44 < heinrich5991> i.e. what we do now, and what we should do instead?
22:45 < ghost91> well, Oy seems to not want to use the framework on osx anymore
22:45 < ghost91> we can use macports or homebrew to install sdl linx way
22:45 < heinrich5991> what is 'the framework'?
22:45 < ghost91> it’s a bundle which contais headers/and the library
22:46 < ghost91> linux way*
22:46 < heinrich5991> ghost91: 'the framework' is something provided by apple, containing standard libraries and headers, such as SDL?
22:46 < ghost91> na
22:46 < ghost91> you can download the framework from the sdl website
22:47 < ghost91> or build it by yourself
22:47 < heinrich5991> oh
22:47 < heinrich5991> it's some kind of package provided by SDL which simply contains the library and the headers?
22:47 < ghost91> yeah, more or less
22:48 < ghost91> it’s relly just a folder with those things and some meta info inside
22:48 < heinrich5991> like a .deb file on debian I guess
22:49 < heinrich5991> so
22:49 < ghost91> not really, because you leave it like that
22:49 < heinrich5991> ok
22:49 < ghost91> you place it in /Libarary/Frameworks
22:49 < ghost91> and apps can use it from there
22:50 < ghost91> now the thing is, when installing via port, you get lot’s of dependencies
22:50 < ghost91> to sdl
22:50 < ghost91> "libX11", "libXext", "libXrandr", "libXrender", "libxcb", "libXau", "libXdmcp"
22:50 < ghost91> these are the libraries i need to include in order for it to work now..
22:50 < heinrich5991> and the way it currently is, it doesn't work with that framework anymore
22:51 < ghost91> well, oy simply removed the framework stuff from sdl.lua
22:51 < ghost91> that’s the only reason it does not work anymore
22:51 < heinrich5991> mh.
22:51 < heinrich5991> and your pull request reverted this?
22:51 < ghost91> his reasoning is that it’s simpler if we unify it with the linix stuff
22:51 < ghost91> yes
22:51 < heinrich5991> meh
22:51 < heinrich5991> oy isn't here anymore
22:51 < ghost91> well, my pullrequest would even do it his way, if sdl is install via brew/port
22:52 < ghost91> installed*
22:52 < heinrich5991> but I would say OS X shouldn't be less supported than linux
22:52 < ghost91> well, it is not
22:52 < heinrich5991> i.e. if it is common to install SDL that way, it should be supported
22:52 < ghost91> i agree
22:52 < ghost91> of course it’s easy to install sdl that way
22:52 < ghost91> and you need to install freetype, too
22:53 < ghost91> you can use brew/ports/build it yourself
22:53 < ghost91> so i actually agree with him, that it would be convenient to do it like this
22:53 < ghost91> but for creating app bundles, it’s just bad
22:53 < ghost91> there’s just no reason to include all those libraries
22:54 < ghost91> if we can instead just include the framework
22:54 < heinrich5991> can you install freetype via this framework thing?
22:54 < ghost91> no
22:54 < heinrich5991> mh :s
22:55 < heinrich5991> well, I commented on your pull request. could you reopen it please?
22:56 < ghost91> did it
22:58 < ghost91> well
23:00 < ghost91> with brew, it does not seem to be a problem
23:01 < ghost91> because they provide binaries
23:01 < ghost91> macports is like the bsd port stuff
23:01 < ghost91> it compiles everything
23:01 < ghost91> the brew binaries do not seem to have those dependencies
23:01 < ghost91> but lot’s of people use ports
23:01 < ghost91> and brew and macports does not mix well...
23:03 < ghost91> well, I’ll think of something
23:05 < ghost91> i need to go now
23:05 < ghost91> cya
23:25 < JulianAssange> deen:  printf 'player_name "\u2063de\u2063en\u2063" ' >> ~/.teeworlds/settings.cfg
23:27 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: \n is missing
23:28 < JulianAssange> heinrich5991: but it's the end of the file
23:28 < JulianAssange> and it'll be overwritten when u start hte client anyways
23:29 < heinrich5991> JulianAssange: if TW supports last-line-not-ending-in-newline, then yes

23:30 < JulianAssange> lol
