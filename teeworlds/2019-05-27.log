00:16 <@heinrich5991> anyone coming to GPN?
01:47 < Dune> I'll be on a trip to the south at that time
01:47 < Dune> have fun :)
11:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what is GPN o.O ?
12:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Goulash Programming Night I believe
12:16 <@heinrich5991> correct :) another ccc event
12:18 <@heinrich5991> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulaschprogrammiernacht
12:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> men heinrich you should montion such thing earlier -.-
12:30 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> mention*
12:43 <@heinrich5991> there's going to be the 36c3 between christmas and new year's eve (as it is every year)
12:43 <@heinrich5991> it's probably going to take place in leipzig
12:43 <@heinrich5991> in which city do you live, @ChillerDragon ?
12:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> leipzig is a bit far east :(
12:46 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> munich
12:48 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> are you going there heinrich5991? Im not sure if i have time but sounds good. And 3h by train is fine.
12:50 < deen> Quite crazy how much GPN grew in the last years
12:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> isn't it fairly old already?
12:51 < deen> not that old, when I went there around 2010/11 it was pretty cozy
14:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> im there
14:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon yes, I'll be on the c3 ðŸ™‚
14:14 < day> heinrich5991: dont forget your antifa toga :p
14:22 < koomi> I'm coming to the gpn
14:24 < koomi> yes it did grow like crazy, I went there for the first time like 5 years ago and it was a smallish event with maybe a few hundred attendees
14:26 < koomi> in august is also the chaos communication camp, highly recommended
14:27 < koomi> basically a festival by/for hackers
16:07 <@heinrich5991> very non-inclusive though â€“ you can't buy tickets if you're not affiliated with some ccc hackerspace
17:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> you can
18:20 < koomi> you need a "voucher" which are distributed by ccc affiliated organisations, you don't need to be a member or anything, just write a mail to a hackerspace near you and ask nicely
20:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> from where you got the wrong informations?
20:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <FluffiexD> you both ....
20:27 < koomi> https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2019/camp-zelte
21:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> time to hack teeworlds (again)
23:01 <@heinrich5991> koomi: can you really just go to hackerspace near you and get one? that wasn't the impression I got
