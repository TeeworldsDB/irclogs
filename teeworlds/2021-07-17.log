12:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> he
12:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> here -\> pricing
12:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> re
12:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> interesting
12:56 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> is there a free tier?
12:57 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what I do is actually manually parse ip lists from a github repo and put those into a redis db.
12:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> occasionally lookup banned ips and occasionally check ips of people and add them tobthe banlists.
12:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/490150878934990850/865910462851973120/Screenshot_2021-07-17-12-58-44-114_com.android.chrome.jpg
13:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> wow such manual
13:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> is the ip list on github good?
13:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's good enough
13:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> https://github.com/Teeworlds-Server-Moderation/monitor-zcatch
13:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I'm nowadays using a slightly different approach.
13:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> mind sharing it?
13:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> we got a dedicated parser for different teeworlds mods that generate events and send them to a rabbitmq broker at
13:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> that sounds really buzzword overenginnered to me \:D
13:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it allows me to build services in the backend while the service generating the events can be swapped with any kind of implementation you want. e.g. you need a different parser for vanilla
13:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> but the backend evaluating the events stays the same
13:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> ok but how do i ban vpns now? \:D
13:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> list
13:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> which
13:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I can send you some via pm
13:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> why so secret?
13:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I guess openly discussing invites the wrong people.
13:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I mean, I can easily share the github, what I did want to share was my list, tho. but if you just want the github one: https://github.com/ejrv/VPNs
13:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> hm, I guess since then I did not support the vanilla log format anymore: https://github.com/jxsl13/TeeworldsEconVPNDetectionGo#example-env
13:23 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> I could update the tool in order for the iphub token not to be mandatory
13:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> now usable without iphub token
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> updated the application. can be used as standalone now with vanilla and zCatch and the redis database does not explode in case you want to add those vpn lists to your redis database
15:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> good luck
22:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <chillerdragon> thanls
