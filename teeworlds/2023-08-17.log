19:49 < minus> i wonder if it makes a difference
19:49 < ChillerDragon> llm enhanced spammers
19:49 < minus> otoh my real name email is nowhere on the internet and i get 0 spam there
19:50 < minus> my main email is and get a couple spams a day
19:50 < ChillerDragon> i put chillerdragon@gmail.com wherever i can and i have yet to receive my first spam
19:50 < minus> not enough to set up a spam filter tho
19:50 < minus> well you're on gmail and gmail probably /dev/nulled half of the actual email you receive
19:51 < ChillerDragon> ye they strong
19:51 < minus> trying to deliver to gmail is a nightmare, fuck them
19:51 < ChillerDragon> spammer
19:51 < bridge_> <d_une> surely no one is scanning the whole page to try and replace the correct first name/name
19:51 < minus> more likely to be the opposite: sending too few mails can get you into delivery problems
19:52 < bridge_> <d_une> like, if the guy is smart enough to know about spam bots, probably he's not your demographics anyway?
19:52 < bridge_> <d_une> except academic spammers
19:52 < bridge_> <d_une> fuck these guys
20:48 < bridge_> <jxsl13> my main email is @googlemail.com

20:56 < bridge_> <jxsl13> I know
20:56 < bridge_> <jxsl13> what I mean is: anyone sending an email to the @gmail.com one os directly put into tue trash
20:57 < bridge_> <jxsl13> I only share my googlemail.com one if I actually use it somewhere
20:57 < bridge_> <jxsl13> what I mean is: anyone sending an email to the @gmail.com one os directly put into the trash
20:57 < bridge_> <jxsl13> what I mean is: anyone sending an email to the @gmail.com one is directly put into the trash

23:00 < minus> my gmail address was also formally @googlemail.com
23:01 < bridge_> <jxsl13> did you get multiple messages?
23:01 < minus> iirc that was some kind of trademark conflict in germany
23:01 < minus> yes, thirce
23:02 < bridge_> <jxsl13> dunno about any trademark conflicts here D:
23:03 < bridge_> <jxsl13> gmail being the conflicting trademark?
23:03 < minus> >Alternatively, googlemail.com is for Gmail users of a particular country where “Gmail”, as a trademark, was already taken. Those countries originally were Germany, the Russian Federation, and Poland.
