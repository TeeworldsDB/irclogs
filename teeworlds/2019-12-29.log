04:30 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> starting to not-suck at this game, lol
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I repeatedly hear that anti Ping is the biggest reason to not update to 0.7
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 
15:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> Could some brain please look into that :/
15:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Yeah well, it's the only large client modification that wasn't ported afaik. I'm not familiar with that at all
15:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> @nuborn
15:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> My understanding why this wasn't put in Teeworlds is that there is no good way to implement this for PvP. e.g. grenades push people
15:19 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Sonix> the one in the ddnet client works quite fine  imho
15:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> the one in ddnet is very complex xd not easy to port
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> especially pvp players complain about missing antiping. And grenades are predicted well in ddnet 0.6
15:26 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Okay :)
15:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> The ddnet antiping is quite complex. For now prediction for other players, projectiles and rocket jumps would be okay I think. Projectiles and other players shouldn't be that hard. Rocket jumps are a bit more work... You need to simulate the rocket before the server knows about it
16:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how to create a app icon for linux and macOS ?
16:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> I used some png to ico web converter but i only get default/invalid icons
16:43 < Dune_> Getting very few servers on 0.7.4 master. Somehow my modified 0.7.3 client loads all the servers, consistently. weird
16:49 < minus> that reminds me i got access to a server to host another master
16:50 < minus> ‚Ä¶in july
16:50 < Dune_> oh, cool... 
17:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> technically if we make the simulation of the game an own module on client and server side
17:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i could do a prediction with bsplines
17:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> You can just share all the physics related code between server and client. For the local character they already use the same code. You could also do this for projectiles but then you can't change physics after a release without breaking the prediction.
17:25 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Gamecore should be migrated to lua/wasm/whatever so the server can send its code to the client üòÖ
17:26 < Dune_> yeah
18:33 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> sooooo
18:33 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> I have a question
18:33 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> how hard would it be to theoretically make a browser version of this game?
18:33 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> that interfaces with the standard servers
18:34 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> I mean, what does the api look like to communicate positions of the players and trajectories etc?
18:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> No udp (except for webrtc) -> high latency -> no fun
18:36 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> well that's the thing
18:36 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> I'm thinking like a golang backend
18:36 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> and just offput the latency onto the browser
18:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> You could use websockets but this would also need support for it in the tw server. And because it uses tcp it would not be very responsive
18:37 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> if YOU want to play the probably-slightly-slower browser ver, good on you/better availability
18:37 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> would love to see this game on tablets for example
18:37 < bridge> [freenode] <JewZeus> and for the majority of players? more than good enough, I think
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> There is some old ddnet version with websockets. There are some tools to compile c/c++ apps to JavaScript/webassembly but you definitely need to change some things.
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> As I said... Network needs to use websockets and the rendering will be a problem
18:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Tw uses threaded rendering + opengl 1.2
18:40 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> You would need a new renderer to make it work in the browser
18:40 < deen> @JewZeus Teewebs works in theory, but we disabled websockets in the DDNet servers again: http://teewebs.net/
18:40 < deen> but if you build your own server with websockets you can connect to it
18:42 < deen> @JewZeus all credits to eeeee: https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=11347
18:43 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> In my opinion the tcp overhead is just too much here. But still... Cool work üëç
18:55 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Was the projectile accuracy increased in 0.7?
18:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> isnt there also a 0.7 vanilla client for the web?
19:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> iirc there aws some medium post
19:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> found it üôÇ https://medium.com/leaningtech/porting-a-c-multiplayer-game-to-the-web-with-cheerp-webrtc-and-firebase-29fbbc62c5ca
19:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> Oh, I was looking for it earlier @ChillerDragon  :)
19:53 < bridge> [freenode] <Choscura> deen, thank you!
20:52 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]> Is there a binary to host a master server or how does masterserver hosting work?
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> personal master servers are kinda useless because all server hosters would have to enter your ip into their config @Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]
21:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Skayland [identifyy host|msg me]> Huh i guess so
22:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> @ChillerDragon do you remmber what happened with https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1659 ?
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> nothing
22:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> tested it like 2 weeks ago and did not work :/
22:20 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> wasn't there an attempted fix?
22:21 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> y
