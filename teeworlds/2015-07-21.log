00:48 < BotoX> Hello mates, which ones of you use Q-tips for cleaning your ears and which don't? Thanks mates.
00:55 <@matricks> q-tips rules
00:56 < Savander> o.O?
00:56 < BotoX> got into an argument with friends about it
00:56 < BotoX> apparently doctors say that they're bad
00:57 < BotoX> probably because of too many people that use them wrong and jam them in lol
00:59 < Savander> im using
00:59 < Savander> weird doctor
00:59 < Savander> maybe he can't use q-tips
01:00 < BotoX> well he isn't using them
01:00 < BotoX> and said they're bad and you shouldn't use them
01:01 < Savander> o.O
01:47 < Pathos> There's also this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_pick#East_Asian
01:48 < Pathos> "Some individuals find ear-picking to be highly pleasurable, thus contributing to the popularity of this service being offered in Asian establishments such as massage parlors, spas, and salons"
01:48 < Pathos> Anthropogeny at work
21:05 < BotoX> are there any Li-Ion battery experts in here (I can't think of any other channel I am in to ask this question)
21:06 < BotoX> I have three Li-Ion 18650 batteries in parallel pulled from a Xiaomi powerbank (NCR18650BF)
21:06 < BotoX> And I'll put two of these in series, how important is balancing actually
21:07 < BotoX> Or how important is balancing for the same type of brand new cells
21:07 <@minus> they might blow up!
21:07 < BotoX> I doubt that
21:07 < BotoX> What can happen as far as I know that one of them will get discharged more than the other
21:08 < BotoX> but I'll charge them through a balancing connector
21:08 < BotoX> aka. won't charge them in series (8.4V) but in parallel (4.2V)
21:09 < BotoX> And the three batteries in parallel are already welded together by xiaomi and will be discharged and charged together
21:09 <@minus> just put all three of them in series, then you'll have 12.6V
21:10 < BotoX> Also it's pretty amazing that it's cheaper to buy a powerbank and rip it apart to get the batteries then buy the batteries themselves
21:10 < BotoX> Also minus I need a 2S configuration :V (8.4V)
21:10 <@minus> no, i don't have anything to offer aside from silly comments
21:10 < BotoX> And I have six in total
21:10 < BotoX> :((((
21:11 < BotoX> two times three in parallel and these in series
21:11 < BotoX> 2S3P
21:11 <@minus> so, 3 parallel in series with 3 parallel?
21:11 < BotoX> https://i.botox.bz/1437505900.png :3
21:12 < BotoX> the small connector will be used to charge the cells in parallel to 4.2V each instead of charging the entire pack
21:12 <@minus> what's the middle thing
21:12 <@minus> ah
21:13 < BotoX> but yeah if any of you need really good _and_ cheap 18650 cells -> http://www.gearbest.com/mobile-power-bank/pp_187685.html
21:13 < BotoX> 3 x sanyo ncr18650bf in there
21:15 <@minus> what are you gonna do with that?
21:15 < BotoX> power some highend flashlights haha
21:15 < BotoX> http://www.gearbest.com/bicycling-gear/pp_182282.html
21:16 < BotoX> or maybe http://www.kaidomain.com/product/details.S024281
21:16 <@minus> "and god said, let there be light"?
21:16 < BotoX> Riding my bicycle at night
21:16 < BotoX> using two XM-L2 torches right now with about 900 lumens each
21:16 < BotoX> but my selfmade mounts suck and idk having a dedicated light is cooler
21:18 < BotoX> sadly most of these chinese lights have rather bad thermal performance, these two are probably the best
21:18 < BotoX> either the case is too small to provide enough heatsinking or the thermal path of the LEDs to the case is awful
21:20 <@minus> can't have good shit without proper engineers after all
21:20 < BotoX> can't beat cheap though
21:21 < BotoX> also most of these are clones from expensive bike lights
21:21 < BotoX> which also have these kind of problems and throttle down lol ... though they cost $300+
21:21 <@minus> cheap doesn't help if it's shit
21:21  * minus glares at seagate
21:21 < BotoX> lel
21:21 < BotoX> nah these two are good
21:21 < BotoX> spent two days researching lights
21:24 <@minus> BotoX: you surely know where to acquire cheap, good HDDs (WD or HGST). was looking at 4x4TB, 650€ tho
21:24 < BotoX> most of my HDDs are actually used
21:24 < BotoX> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
21:25 < BotoX> why do you need that much storage though
21:25 <@minus> store all the things!
21:25 < BotoX> (have fun rebuilding with 4TB drives lmao)
21:25 <@minus> i'll be rebuilding my 8TB RAID (2TB disks) tomorrow hopefully
21:25 <@minus> it's full though
21:25 < BotoX> damn
21:26 < BotoX> I have a new empty 3TB WD HDD in my server
21:26 < BotoX> old one died -> got new one
21:26 < BotoX> I don't even think it has an FS lol
21:26 <@minus> inb4 WD green
21:27  * minus actually ordered a WD green as replacement
21:27 <@minus> because the other disks are already old and have tens of thousands of power on hous
21:27 <@minus> hours*
21:28 <@minus> those samsung spinpoint ecogreens are good, but apparently samsung no longer makes HDDs
21:28 < BotoX>   9 Power_On_Hours          0x0032   080   080   000    Old_age   Always       -       18146
21:28 < BotoX> yeah samsung HDDs are ded
21:28 < BotoX> SSDs yield much more profit kekeke
21:28 < heinrich5991> kekeke
21:28 < heinrich5991> ?
21:28 < heinrich5991> what deos that even mean?
21:29 < BotoX> google image greedy jew
21:29 <@minus> 17714 ← failed seagate one
21:29 < BotoX> Mine are all seagates
21:29 <@minus> 26940 ← samsung ones
21:30 < BotoX> https://i.botox.bz/1437507016.png
21:30 < BotoX> Should do another scrub maybe haha
21:30 <@minus> linux or freebsd?
21:31 < BotoX> linux :-)
21:31 < BotoX> archlinux even heh
21:31 <@minus> the kernel or FUSE one?
21:31 < BotoX> kernel ofc.
21:31 < BotoX> with linux-lts
21:31 < BotoX> EDIS is using that in production actually
21:31 <@minus> what's a raidz1?
21:32 < BotoX> RAID5
21:32 < BotoX> so are a few other companies that I know
21:32 <@minus> they're using arch linux-lts and zfs?
21:32 < BotoX> no not arch haha
21:32 < BotoX> Debian I thnk
21:32 < BotoX> With zfs on linux
21:32 < Learath2> buying some new drives in a week seagate or wd ?
21:33 <@minus> WD
21:33 < Learath2> always had seagates, they are cheaper but somewhy everyone keeps suggesting me WDs
21:33 <@minus> well, depending on what you're gonna be using them for
21:33 < BotoX> I don't even know what I'd get
21:33 <@minus> seagate certainly is cheaper
21:33 < BotoX> I had more WD drives fail on me than seagate
21:34 < BotoX> just go for whatever is cheaper and keep backups lol
21:34 <@minus> this isactually the first seagate that's failing on me
21:34 < Learath2> I had many seagate drives and only one is failing right now and its around 30000 power on hours
21:34 < BotoX> But if you really need reliability go for Hitachi
21:34 < Learath2> backup drives are expensive when ill be getting 2x2TB
21:34 <@minus> failing one month after warranty expires
21:34 < BotoX> which is expensive as fuck
21:35 <@minus> HGST is hitatchi, right?
21:35 < BotoX> I think so
21:35 < BotoX> Actualyl no
21:35 < BotoX> That's WD
21:35 < Learath2> oh i guess ill be going WD as local shop doesnt seem to be stocking 2tb seagates :D
21:35 < BotoX> they bought hitachi right
21:36 <@minus> HGST, Inc. (formerly Hitachi Global Storage Technologies) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Western Digital
21:36 < BotoX> So there's only WD and Seagate left
21:36 < BotoX> lole
21:36 < BotoX> Seagate bought Samsung and WD bought Hitachi
21:36 <@minus> WD is actually an american company, wow
21:36 < BotoX> like it matters haha
21:37 <@minus> ofc
21:37 < Learath2> \o/ hdds are twice as expensive as they were last year
21:38 < BotoX> again?
21:38 <@minus> not twice, but some more
21:38 < Learath2> euro-dollar parity went to shit then turkish liras went to shit so around 2.5x actually
21:38 < BotoX> https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/internal-hard-drive/
21:40 < Learath2> minus: idk what all these models are targeted at what is the normal WD
21:40 < BotoX> just hope there won't be another flood in asia lole :D
21:40 < BotoX> What will you be using them for Learath2 
21:40 < BotoX> If they're just cold storage then get WD Green
21:40 < BotoX> If not then don't get WD Green
21:40 < Learath2> storage for my make-shift NAS
21:40 < BotoX> So in a RAID? Get WD Red
21:41 < Learath2> hoping to get them in a RAID but will be more of an investment then i thought it would be initialy :P
21:41 < BotoX> also what's a make-shift NAS?
21:42 < Learath2> its just a computer i put together to have a NAS
21:42 < Learath2> not like the fancy NAS things you can get with the special firmware and stuff
21:42 < BotoX> how much RAM does it have
21:42 < BotoX> yeah fuck these anyways
21:43 < Learath2> it has 8gb of ram
21:43 < BotoX> Get FreeNAS on it
21:43 < BotoX> or some linux and zfs on linux
21:44 <@minus> we have a (consumer grade) buffalo NAS at work
21:44 <@minus> it's beyond turd
21:44 < Learath2> well i was hoping i would get some 2x2gb ram on it and get my 2x4 back
21:44 < Learath2> i just put it together with parts i had laying around
21:45 < Learath2> freenas actually looks nice
21:45 < BotoX> then forget ZFS haha
21:45 <@minus> my NAS/file server/whatever you wanna call it runs arch, 5x2TB RAID5 (well, currently 4x2TB) with ext4
21:45 <@minus> on 2GB RAM
21:45 < BotoX> ewwwwww
21:46 < Learath2> thats around 1000$s worth of harddisks wtf
21:46 <@minus> and athlon ii 64 somethingsomething
21:47 < BotoX> wat Learath2 
21:47 < BotoX> no it's not lol
21:47 <@minus> those disks are mostly from 2011 or so
21:47 < Learath2> with the current price here it is
21:47 < heinrich5991> BotoX: what about btrfs btw?
21:47 < BotoX> turkey price != 1st world country prices :p
21:48 < BotoX> not stable heinrich5991 
21:48 < BotoX> at least the RAID feature
21:48 <@minus> 3 from 2011, 2 from 2013
21:49 < Learath2> oh its the new electronics tax of %40 thats throwing me off
21:49 <@minus> re hdd prices, 4TB WD reds went from their lowest point at about 140€ to about 160€ now
21:49 < Learath2> ill just smuggle hdds :/
21:49 <@minus> 40%?!
21:50 < BotoX> just order them from somewhere else then Learath2 
21:50 < BotoX> lol
21:50 < Learath2> then the shipping kills me
21:50 < Learath2> ill buy it when im in Paris in fall i guess
21:50 < BotoX> good idea
21:51 < Learath2> for now ill claim some old hdds and put them together in a RAID
21:57 < BotoX> https://i.botox.bz/1437508675.png
21:58 < BotoX> damn
22:18 <@minus> what's that
22:54 < BotoX> google search history
