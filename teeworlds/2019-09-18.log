12:29 < bepis_> Hi, does the nick alex4 ring a bell?
13:19 < IRLDune> bepis_: not to me
15:39 < Miki_> Hello TW gods. Guy with server ip: 5.196.132.11:8306 faking players. He's doing it so long time to get players. So can you fix this issue?
16:31 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> I dont see any fake players there
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> full if fake dummies it seems.
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> of
16:32 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> they are real clients, no problem here
16:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> depends, who is connecting them to the server.
16:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> the owner, from its own pc i assume
16:33 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> his*
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's considered fake client's I'd guess?
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> lol
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> that's considered fake clients I'd guess?
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> yes, I think that's also not allowed
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> why shouldnt it be allowed
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> because it misleads players
16:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> it's the same as if you simply have fake server side clients.
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ddnet client illegal then
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> one does not see the difference there. one eould expect to play with people if they saw people on a server.

16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> fokkonaut server illegal the xD
16:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> no
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> they are marked as bots
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> >:D
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> ^^
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> they are actually there for a reason, not for filling the server
16:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> >:?
16:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> the one is a block bot, you can play against him in /block, the other one is the shop bot, he introduces you to the shop if you appear there, the next one is a police bot, he races until he reaches the poicebase solo, then helps others there if they are police
16:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> what about the clients that that are connected like 24/7 and not playing :0
16:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> afk players, farming
16:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> not illegal
16:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> lol, what's there to farm Oo
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> money and xp
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> :o
16:39 < Miki_> so i can connect 50 clients from my pc to my server and let them 24/7?
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> :o it's basically a city mod
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> it is a block/city/ddrace/fun mod xd
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> yea
16:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> sad stuff xD

16:42 <@heinrich5991> Miki_: I contacted the server admins on their discord. if they don't act until tomorrow, you can tell me again (if they're still doing it and aren't banned)
16:42 < bridge> [teeworlds] <fokkonaut> oh boy! master server ban incoming
16:43 < Miki_> heinrich5991: Ok.
