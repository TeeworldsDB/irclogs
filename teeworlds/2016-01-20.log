16:38 < Obani> Hey people, do you know where could I find any trace of the TeeWorlds BattleField mod ?
16:42 <@heinrich5991> have you checked the forums?
16:42 < Obani> You mean the 22 pages ?
16:42 < Obani> No, not for now
16:42 < Obani> I check DDG actually, and am a bit bored of searching in those lines for now :p
16:43 < Obani> I asked to know if someone had the link booked or a github link to the mod, something like that
16:44 <@heinrich5991> I don't, I was just providing generic advice
16:48 < laxadedi> In 2016, forums have search functions.
16:49 < Obani> laxadedi, I didn't want to say that in public but I'm forced to agree ^^'
16:50 < laxadedi> https://www.teeworlds.com/forum/search.php?search_id=1196510121
16:50 < laxadedi> I am too kind
16:50 <@heinrich5991> laxadedi: and the teeworlds forum search function is shit
16:50 <@heinrich5991> (worse than google at least)
16:59 < Obani> well at least there's one
