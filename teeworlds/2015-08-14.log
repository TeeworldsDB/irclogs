00:29 <@minus> last time we wanted to get it out was 2012 i think
00:33 < LittleWhite> Do a version called "Teeworlds 2015" ! :D
00:34 < Savander> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5_cNX1vQGI
00:34 < Savander> Any opinions?
00:34 < Savander> (Teeworlds trailer)
00:34 < LittleWhite> Wait :)
00:35 < LittleWhite> First, good point : this is not too long 
00:35 < Savander> ^^
00:36 < LittleWhite> After the third sequence (Deathmatch), we see a short sequence (5 secs or so), and no new text, but new map
00:36 <@minus> the font in the very end looks off
00:36 < LittleWhite> I thought you would say something like a new game mode, but nothing 
00:36 < LittleWhite> Map making is too fast speeded up
00:36 <@minus> seems quite TF2-ish to me
00:37 < LittleWhite> I mean ... too long would be borring of course, but, here, it's like, I get sick since nothing to get my eyes on
00:37 < LittleWhite> (too much blinking that's the big point)
00:37 < Savander> You know, i don't have a lot of time
00:37 < Savander> 1 minutes isn't that much ^^
00:37 < Savander> 1 minute*
00:38 < Savander> very end, you mean CREDITS?
00:38 < Savander> or url ?
00:38 <@minus> url
00:38 < Savander> oh yes, i did it specially
00:38 < Savander> to make it clear as possible i can
00:38 <@matricks> Savander: kerning on capture the flag is wrong
00:39 <@matricks> kerning in general with As are off
00:39 < Savander> i don't know what "kerning" means :/
00:39 <@matricks> spacing between letters
00:39 < Savander> aaah
00:39 <@minus> on map making it's ok though, matricks
00:39 < LittleWhite> :D
00:40 <@matricks> check the capture the flag
00:40 <@matricks> looks like CA PTURE THE FLAG
00:40 < Savander> okay, thats weird
00:40 < Savander> i can't change it beacaujse
00:40 < Savander> its font
00:41 < Savander> i added spaace only between
00:41 < Savander> capture -> the
00:41 < Savander> and the -> flag
00:41 < LittleWhite> Solution for map making blinks (I will get epilleptic !) -> keep the same timeline for the video, just, simplify what we can see during the map making sequence (less blkinking/more stabilized stuff). The part where the sun is moving is nice. I can totally understand it, (and love it) even if it's really short
00:41 <@matricks> yeah, that font has bad kerning info
00:41 <@matricks> DEA THMA TCH
00:41 < Savander> yee i see that too
00:41 <@minus> you can always fix it in photoshop/gimp
00:41 < Savander> i'll
00:41 < Savander> those text are in photoshop
00:42 < Savander> i didn't export it
00:42 <@matricks> and the mapping section is a bit flickery
00:42 < Savander> i can't change it, and it will be in movie making program
00:42 < Savander> you mean, too fast?
00:42 <@matricks> kind of yeah
00:43 <@matricks> but nice
00:43 < Savander> generally, maybe i should just cut 30 second of clip (from map making)
00:43 < Savander> and make it a bit faster
00:43 < Savander> (timelaps)]
00:43 < LittleWhite> Savander: In map section, show like, three thing, in a slow peace fashion : placing walls / placing guns (two or three) or hearts... / placing the sun
00:43 < Savander> i want to show map
00:44 < LittleWhite> and then, you show the final product :)
00:44 < LittleWhite> with people fighting
00:44 < Savander> not exactly those things
00:44 < Savander> because you know, i want to show people
00:44 < Savander> "oh cmon! I can create map then people can play on it!"
00:44 < Savander> "AWESOME!"
00:44 < LittleWhite> the little second, where you are fading in, and we can even see the list of maps is useless. We don't have to see the list of files
00:45 < Savander> it's not list o maps
00:45 < Savander> :D
00:45 < Savander> of* maps
00:45 < Savander> it's list of graphics
00:45 < Savander> used in map ^>
00:45 < LittleWhite> It's the first time that I see the editor !
00:45 < LittleWhite> :D
00:45 < Savander> haha ^.
00:45 < LittleWhite> see, your video is useful :D
00:46 < Savander> ^^.
00:46 < Savander> but, how you like it?
00:46 < LittleWhite> Ok, I will continue on my idea, with three things to show : place walls / place powerup / place sun (or background) , then you kind of unzoom it (to see results) then -> Play !
00:46 < LittleWhite> I think, it will be enough and remove the epilleptic part
00:47 < Savander> yeah, it's a bit fast :D
00:47 < LittleWhite> because, sorry, to me, from 0:34, to 0:39 it's only lot of fast blinking, that I can't even see what you are doing
00:47 < LittleWhite> otherwise : Really good video
00:47 < Savander> without music it'll be baaad
00:48 < Savander> thanks to teetow!
00:48 < Savander> who helps me a lot 
00:48 < LittleWhite> I don't know if it is your first, or something like this , but I am seeing some trailers on programming forum that are really boring and not interresting
00:49 < LittleWhite> yours is good and maybe I was a bit harsh, but I really like it and it's just minor thing to change (ok, minor things can be hard to change)
00:49 < LittleWhite> Savander: Oh, my last advice : think the video for people without headphones, or at work, or with no sound
00:49 < LittleWhite> lot of videos are watched without the sound
00:49 < LittleWhite> sorry teetow :[
00:50 < Savander> i can't thing about it, movie without sounds
00:50 < Savander> just looks bad
00:50 < Savander> :)
00:50 < LittleWhite> so, you have to get the video appealing even without the music (which is good for sure, and does the part of the job)
00:50 < Savander> It's was my first time
00:50 < LittleWhite> I will try to see it without music now
00:50 < Savander> in this type of video
00:50 < LittleWhite> without music, the slowdown at the beginning is ... boring
00:51 < LittleWhite> the sequences are a bit long (capture the flag / deatchmatch)
00:52 < LittleWhite> between map making and "open source" sequences, we would attend to get a new text like : And play it , or maybe more aggressive, like : destroy your friends on it !
00:52 < LittleWhite> (of course, you have to keep the text short)
00:53 < Savander> play it now
00:53 < Savander> at end
00:54 < LittleWhite> to me, the sequence between 0:28 / 0:32 has no explanation (no new text, nothing new ... )
00:54 < LittleWhite> "play it now" is nice, sure
00:54 < LittleWhite> but, looks like something was missing, between the map making sequence, and the moment when you play on the map you have done
00:55 < Savander> between 0:28/0:32 clear gameplay
00:56 < Savander> it's bad place text everywhere i think ^^ :D
00:56 < LittleWhite> I am not sure
00:57 < LittleWhite> I mean, people who don't know teeworlds, don't know how to interpret the pictures 
00:57 < Savander> i know, but in trailers
00:57 < Savander> you don't have texts everywhere, very often is clear gameplay
00:58 < LittleWhite> yes, but the pictures are clear enough 
00:58 < LittleWhite> I mean
00:58 < LittleWhite> you said just before (in the video) -> Capture the flag  ; then ; deathmatch ; then you are showing something ... it looks like deathmatch ... is it really deathmatch again ? or what ?
00:59 < Savander> you mean, i shoudl change positions ? capture the flag <-> deathmatch?
01:00 < LittleWhite> no, ... I am trying to see the interest of the sequence between 0:28 / 0:32
01:00 < LittleWhite> can you give me some time
01:00 < LittleWhite> please
01:04 < LittleWhite> New idea : what to not do something about the grapple ? 
01:04 < LittleWhite> This is like a key point and unique feature of the game, isn't it ?
01:04 < LittleWhite> (if you answer yes to that, it means you have to show it :p )
01:05 < LittleWhite> Everybody loves the grapple ... everybody remembers the ninja rope from Worms and likes it
01:06 < LittleWhite> Otherwise, I propose this timeline :
01:06 < LittleWhite> Title | Capture the flag (map 1) | Capture the flag (map 2) | Deathmath (map 1) | Deathmath (map 2) | Map Making | Play/Share maps | Open source ! | Play it now | URL
01:07 < LittleWhite> And I think you can add a sequence on grapple, because grapple is wonderful, you can even grapple your enemies and throw them in holes ! (everybody loves that too :D )
01:07 < Savander> i don't want to change that much, in my opinion it looks good now. I changed map-making section, text now doesn't have bad kerning
01:08 < Savander> and i have no time for grapple on video
01:08 < Savander> it's hard to find really good action who'll fit to video ^^>
01:08 < Savander> i mean, this action 0:28/0:32 fits very well
01:08 < Savander> with music
01:09 < Savander> i like suggestions, but grapple isn't important at all ^^.
01:10 < LittleWhite> ok :)
01:10 < LittleWhite> no problem
01:10 < Savander> "Solution for map making blinks (I will get epilleptic !) -> keep the same timeline for the video, just, simplify what we can see during the map making sequence (less blkinking/more stabilized stuff). The part where the sun is moving is nice. I can totally understand it, (and love it) even if it's really short"
01:10 < Savander> changed ^^>
01:10 < LittleWhite> Thanks ! :)
01:10 < LittleWhite> I think that was the most important point
01:11 < Savander> ^^>
01:11 < Savander> Btw, what with last font
01:11 < Savander> should stay
01:11 < Savander> or another idea?
01:11 < LittleWhite> URL font ?
01:11 < Savander> for me it's good, don't know how for you
01:11 < Savander> yes
01:11 < Savander> URL Font
01:11 < Savander> this waint with black shadow
01:11 < Savander> on blured video
01:11 < Savander> ^^
01:11 < Savander> with*
01:11 < Savander> xD
01:12 < Savander> k
01:12 < LittleWhite> I don't have a clear position on this :s
01:13 < Savander> ^^
01:13 < Savander> maybe should staay :p
01:14 < LittleWhite> it's ok, for me
01:14 < LittleWhite> (you could win some time by having only one screen for credits :p )
01:17 < Savander> yee, but it looks fine i guess?:D
01:17 < Savander> or not?;c
01:17 < LittleWhite> TROLL MODE : no, because if it is shorter you can add grapple sequence  :P
01:18 < Savander> i can txd
01:18 < Savander> credits has 
01:18 < Savander> song repeated
01:18 < Savander> xd
01:18 < LittleWhite> I know that, and the music saves your credits :p
01:18 < Savander> ^^
01:18 < LittleWhite> I think people will quit the vid, when the screen fades to black (just after URL)
01:19 < LittleWhite> Trailer does not have credits. Even for movies, they keep the universal / Columbia really short (like half a second )
01:19 < Savander> people always quite the vid
01:19 < Savander> on credits :PP
01:19 < LittleWhite> Oh yeah :D
01:19 < Savander> but you know
01:20 < Savander> this trailer did community ^
01:20 < Savander> without music, demos
01:20 < Savander> people who want to record last demo
01:20 < Savander> (on map created by me, this in map-making section)
01:21 < LittleWhite> I saw that :)
01:21 < LittleWhite> I even didn't know how looks the editor :p
01:21 < Savander> it wouldn't look like it now
01:22 < Savander> like it looks now*  xD
01:22 < Savander> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZWQ_O7Jp9E&feature=youtu.be
01:22 < LittleWhite> But I thought the trailer was also for steam, and so, lot of people who don't know the game will see the trailer
01:22 < Savander> generally i made this trailer
01:22 < Savander> for steam
01:22 < Savander> ^^ :PP
01:23 < LittleWhite> You remove the sun placing part :'( :'( :'(
01:23 < Savander> :))
01:23 < Savander> ^>
01:24 < Savander> i think that's enough :D
01:24 < LittleWhite> To me it was important (the sun, which is a moon, but I will continue to say the sun ! ) because it's yellow and so, quickly noticeable (compare to other element) and it's the thing that you see the longer during the "play phase" 
01:25 < LittleWhite> I understand ;)
01:25 < LittleWhite> Sorry to have bother/annoy you
01:25 < Savander> i think, trees are noticeable
01:25 < Savander> no no, don't worry haha
01:25 < Savander> we have different opinions, that's good :D
01:25 < LittleWhite> yes, tree is a good element to show :)
01:26 < Savander> and tree is there!
01:26 < Savander> ^^
01:26 < Savander> (with zoom out)
01:26 < LittleWhite> Yes, and this is good :)
01:29 < LittleWhite> I think, this version is good
01:29 < LittleWhite> Or maybe I watch it too much :D
01:29 < Savander> like me..
01:30 < Savander> i don't see a lot of things
01:30 < LittleWhite> yes ... that's the problem of the creator/artist
01:30 < LittleWhite> He can't really enjoy it's creation
01:31 < LittleWhite> But really, this video is nice
01:31 < LittleWhite> For sure
01:31 < LittleWhite> nothing shocking, nor boring. Which means the video is good
01:31 < LittleWhite> Good job :)
01:32 < LittleWhite> You can let it like that , I would not cry :p
01:32 < Savander> Haha, thanks !
01:32 < LittleWhite> Seriously, you did a great job :)
01:36 < Savander> about : "yes ... that's the problem of the creator/artist". yeea, but in other case, it's cool to show your work to others, and if you see when they enjoy it.. that's great for me !
01:36 < LittleWhite> True :)
01:36 < LittleWhite> I will go to sleep
01:36 < LittleWhite> I have the music of the trailer in my head 
01:36 < Savander> yea. me too
01:36 < Savander> haha
01:37 < Savander> Teetow!
01:37 < LittleWhite> I am really happy to see that the game that I like gets a good trailer :)
01:37 < LittleWhite> I will sleep happy, thank you
01:37 < LittleWhite> (and good night)
01:37 < Savander> good night ;)

13:33 <@matricks> never climbed with a route
13:33 <@matricks> *rope
13:33 <@matricks> if I'm outside and nice weather, I'm flying

15:58 < jxsl13> ty botnik
15:58 < jxsl13> wondering, why this hasnt been merged https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/1375
16:00 <@matricks> wonder whats the reason for removing the pragma once
16:00 < jxsl13> let's see what the commit says
16:01 <@matricks> most of this seems.. well.. unnessesary
16:01 <@matricks> over objectification
16:01 < jxsl13> it's in order to get a better documented code :D
16:02 < jxsl13> and a self explaining one as well
16:02 < jxsl13> https://github.com/Choupom/teeworlds/commit/f2c1345a3bc192fed13814f4c507d4536fa308d0
16:08 <@matricks> okey.. meh...
16:09 < jxsl13> mind explaining the "fix"?
16:10 <@matricks> the fix?
16:10 < jxsl13> the commit about fixing the header guard
16:11 <@matricks> just to make it conform to the rest of the code, the code should go the other way is my argument
16:11 < jxsl13> oh k
16:12 < jxsl13> thankfully you are an ai only :D
16:12 < jxsl13> :P
16:13 <@matricks> kill all humans!
