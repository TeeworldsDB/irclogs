08:46 < ChillerDragon> 128.140.58.224:8303 is registering a modded server as CTF in the master
08:46 < ChillerDragon> the github is linked there is probably a way to contact the admin
11:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> https://github.com/pauhull/teeworlds/pull/1
11:17 < bridge> <heinrich5991> ChillerDragon: would be nice if you could do the admin contacting ^^
11:20 < bridge> <d_une> No ban yet then? ü§ê
11:23 < bridge> <heinrich5991> they were nice enough to provide contact info, I'm gonna give them the benefit of doubt
17:54 < bridge> <chillerdragon> It‚Äôs no contact but at least it seems to show the GitHub account of the dev
17:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> post it
17:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Connect to the server -.-
17:55 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Im mobile
17:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> is it that pauhull
17:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> one?
17:55 < bridge> <jxsl13> me too
17:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I think so
17:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> He has afd in the server name .\_.
17:56 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Quality German racism
17:56 < bridge> <jxsl13> no comment D:
17:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea it somehow makes me not want to contact him
17:58 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Heinrich you go
17:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> heinrich already opened a PR
17:58 < bridge> <jxsl13> as a contact attempt
17:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Send
17:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Is it to set a gametype ? \:D
17:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Ah wait he sent it
17:59 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Loool how did I not see that
18:00 < bridge> <jxsl13> heinrich was even nice enough to create a pr that fixes the issue
18:02 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea I Thought about that too \:D but I‚Äôm not as nice as Heinrich
18:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> So i decided to report this user to the authorities instead
18:03 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Who even enforces master bans these days? Heinrich?
18:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> last commit was in march
18:04 < bridge> <d_une> I was a few keystrokes away from it
18:04 < bridge> <d_une> but yeah, heinrich too
18:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> wonder about the activity of that person.
18:04 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Trigger happy dune axaxaxax
18:05 < bridge> <jxsl13> Dune has pedals for master bans D:
18:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> xd
18:08 < bridge> <chillerdragon> I gotta be nice to dune then with my borderline legal Econ automation server
18:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> when is the logging going to be fixed?!
18:09 < bridge> <jxsl13> D:
18:09 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Wot
18:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> has the issue ever been fixed where you cannot properly track the currently online players when doing a map change?
18:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> track via rcon
18:11 < bridge> <jxsl13> rather rcon
18:11 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Imagine allowing map change
18:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> CTF5 all the way
18:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> imagine D:
18:12 < bridge> <jxsl13> map changes existing
18:12 < bridge> <chillerdragon> Yea not sure didn‚Äôt touch tw logs in forever. But I assume it‚Äôs still broken .\_.
18:13 < bridge> <jxsl13> *econ not rcon...
