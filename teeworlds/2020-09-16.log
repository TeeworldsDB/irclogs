18:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> before you think about implementing water, what about slopes?
18:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> slopes were already implemented at some point
18:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it turned out that they don't integrate well in vanilla gameplay because they require tees to go on the ground where they are vulnerable (iirc)
18:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> so the idea was rejected
18:16 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> hmm, that reasoning is discussable
18:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> it is
18:17 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> the reason I see for slopes is less movement penalty
18:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> what we'd need imo would be a project where several physics modifications are implemented to let people alpha test the stuff, gather feedback, see what is judged fun etc.
18:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> i would really want slopes on the ctf5 spots, where you have a 1 block height difference
18:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I agree with that alpha project ðŸ˜„
18:18 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> without going through this intermediary state I'm pretty sure no physics addition will be accepted in teeworlds
18:22 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> in 0.6 I remember we had trunk versions, maybe 0.7.5 trunk or something ðŸ˜„
18:35 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Dune> trunk just means master
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> svn speak
18:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion ctrl-f trunk
18:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> eww
18:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> They still use SVN for exams at my uni...
18:50 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I hope you are not studying computer science
18:51 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> ðŸ˜„
18:53 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> are there any reasons except historical to prefer svn over git?
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> svn can handle bigger files better IIRC
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> that's why we use git lfs at work
18:54 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> so there's one reason I guess, svn supports binary files natively
18:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I am studying computer engineering....
18:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> @Learath2 (I only said this because of SVN, not because of you or something ðŸ˜„ )
18:58 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The class is a joke anyway, "Object Oriented Programming" in Java
18:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> Java was my first language, too, it isn't a bad starter language
18:59 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It gives you the awful habit of "OOP everything"
19:00 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes, until you finish your algorithm and datastructures class
19:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> One thing I've really been enjoying is the functional programming capabilities of Java. I like how collections and streams work there
19:01 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I enjoy python very much currently, it's just so much less code to write and maintain
19:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Everytime I give python a chance I want to break my computer in half, so I'm steering clear of it for a while
19:02 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> xD
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I have no idea how a language that's supposed to be "plug n play"/"granny friendly" has such a god awful import system
19:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> from x.y import z
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> that's the pleasant part
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Try a nested project
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you mean the package managing part? that's annoying
19:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Package managing is also god awful yes
19:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> I have never seen a less capable package manager
19:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I outsourced package managing to peotry
19:05 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> *poetry
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> https://python-poetry.org/
19:06 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> In ddnet's bridge code I generate both the 0.7 and 0.6 protocol. It took a month of research into the stupid import system and I never figured it out
19:07 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> and for substructures in directories I only needed `__init__.py`
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> deen managed to get it working with `-m` but I just ditched the project
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> We would have had bridge servers 3 months earlier if we were using any language that's not python to implement the code generation
19:08 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I wonder why you generate the netcode on the way, anyway
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> it's cute
19:09 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> and if anything changes in vanilla, I just need to copy a directory over
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Oh and with the source files, I can generate the translation map easily. If I copy the already generated network.h I need to parse C++ with libclang, which is less than fun
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> I would have worked more with inheritance, so if you update the netcode you can just create another new child of a netcode parent part and allowing more netcode versions
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The netcode is not
19:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The netcode is not ready for any extensions
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> It'd have been a major rework that way
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> yes, which is why we have two active teeworlds versions and bridged servers
19:12 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Exactly, it'd be great if we could all work together on getting some QoL in for modding
19:13 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> `SnapReplaceItem` would help a lot. The extended network protocol would be great. Map extensions would be great. Datafile extensions would also be great
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> The extended serverinfo protocol, or just replacing the serverinfo protocol with http
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> Or finally a clean `IGameController` that's just an ABC along with a `CGameContext`Â that's completely gamemode unaware
19:14 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Assa> neat, Teeworlds amplified dos attacks ðŸ¤”
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> 0.7 is safe from amplification afaik
19:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> 0.6 does allow some amplified reflection but we ratelimit so it doesn't get out of hand
