19:05 < Dune> hey
19:05 < Dune> where does it show a count of remaining players in survival?
19:06 < Dune> are we supposed to deduce it from the number on the second player of the score HUD?
19:08 < Oy> hey
19:08 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/src/game/client/components/hud.cpp#L176
19:09 < Oy> dunno what the best way would be in non-team based games
19:09 < Dune> isn't that only when you're dead?
19:10 < Dune> ooh never mind
19:10 < Dune> I guess I never play team-based survivals :)
19:10 < Oy> :P
19:10 < Oy> it's written under the score biox, like the flag carier name in ctf
19:10 < Dune> right
19:10 < Dune> does it make sense to show two scores?
19:11 < Oy> in single player survival?
19:11 < Dune> yeah
19:11 < Oy> could drop it
19:11 < Dune> I mean I don't see any reason not to write it just like in team survival
19:11 < Dune> it's just a matter of where to put it, in between or on the bottom/top
19:13 < Oy> should probably use the same area (score hud one) for it, cause u r used to it to check for win/score condition during a match
19:16 < Dune> yes
19:17 < Dune> skins stuff is done (see forum)
19:17 < Dune> maybe we can do something before xmas? :)
19:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> uff pressure
19:28 < Oy> dunno if there're some blocker issues left? :)
19:28 < Oy> but some release would be nice
19:30 < Dune> redix demo stuff is a blocker issue
19:30 < Dune> rest is good to go imo
19:33 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2253 that should be fixed
19:33 < Dune> oh yeah right
19:33 < Oy> yeah and this demo thing https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2230
19:34 < Oy> and maybe sth here https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2159
19:35 < Dune> yeah last one isn't easy
19:35 < Oy> maybe this? https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1911
19:35 < Oy> yeah
19:36 < Dune> if @Zatline wants to yeah
19:36 < Dune> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2276 is kinda popular and would be on my personal list, but not blocking
19:38 < Dune> if we are to give a week for translations, and to release before xmas, we have a week or so
19:38 < Dune> at least for stuff that affects strings
19:38 < Oy> yeah
19:57 < Dune> ah, also, @Sonix and @Assa had a (similar) idea for a wintery menu theme
19:57 < Dune> @Sonix's version is well uncluttered, but there is a bug we couldn't fix in the map
20:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also macOS resolutions is still a issue
20:17 < Oy> what's the bug?
20:17 < Oy> ChillerDragon what's the issue?
20:17 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> its not possible to change the resolution on macos
20:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and default is not even the correct one
20:18 < Oy> it's the desktop one
20:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> a mac user reported me that the window mode in 0.7 is unusable so he is forced to stay in 0.6
20:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no its not the desktop resolution
20:18 < Oy> then it's a sdl bug
20:18 < Oy> on my mac i always had the desktop one
20:18 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well in ddnet client also using sdl2 it works
20:20 < Oy> it's even called SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP
20:20 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> ikr
20:21 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> oh boi i even got a illegal instruction crash on macos
20:22 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon>

20:23 < Oy> probably some highdpi thing
20:23 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> well every mac nowa days has such a high resolution
20:24 < Oy> can't test it on my macmini :P
20:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> 2019-12-06 20:25:09.615911+0100 teeworlds[12253:141989] [teeworlds] CGContextSetFillColorWithColor: invalid context 0x0. If you want to see the backtrace, please set CG_CONTEXT_SHOW_BACKTRACE environmental variable.
20:25 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> also this does not look good
20:28 < Oy> that's some non-teeworlds function, would be good to have a backtrace to see where it originates from
20:28 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> im working on it new to macos debgging
20:29 < Oy> Dune: then maybe just go with the 10th?
20:29 < Oy> revert the pr https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2230 if there's no fix till then and do it again after the release?
20:30 < Oy> then everything should be good to go codewise
20:30 < Oy> well except that scrolling maybe
20:30 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> what about the broken arrow selection in menus?
20:31 < Oy> yeah, that could be done till release. doesn't add any localization stuff
20:32 < Dune> Oy, #2230 doesn't touch strings, so we have a bit of time with that one
20:33 < Oy> true
20:33 < Dune> welp didnt read the last line
20:33 < Oy> it was directed to the arrow thing, but true :)
20:33 < Dune> arrow thing?
20:33 < Dune> chiller's issue?
20:33 < Dune> ah nvm I didn't miss only one line :D
20:34 < Oy> :P
20:34 < Oy> then from 10th to release just some polishing and translations
20:35 < Oy> that highdpi fix wasn't in a release yet right?
20:35 < Dune> huuh
20:35 < Dune> didn't follow that one
20:36 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/9b22b2426daf71bac6078a2376544a96cd7f06b4 doesn't seem so, good to have that one in a release
20:38 < Oy> seems we have a plan :)
20:39 < Dune> yeay :)
20:43 < Dune> I also suggest https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/commit/7ebd6121e6acbdba209292a48d1be170c2ea92cd
20:43 < Dune> because of the high server/player ratio we had some players say they "can't see anyone" who just didn't scroll
20:44 < Dune> (it default sorts by ping iirc but those in unpopular regions see unpopular servers on the top because of that)
20:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> http://149.202.127.134:8080/44
20:46 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> that took too long xd
20:47 < Dune> so that's opengl?
20:47 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> no clue
20:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> but its just a warning
20:49 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> and here is a actual crash http://149.202.127.134:8080/jo
20:50 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> seems like macOS tw is kinda unstable currently :/
20:51 < Dune> and it doesnt work on metal since they dropped opengl
21:13 < Oy> and there's the gatekeeper problem too. can't do a release anymore soon?
21:13 < Oy> dunno if mac is  worth the effort
21:13 < Dune> some archs are not so common I guess
21:14 < Dune> I don't know about gatekeepr
21:16 < Oy> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeper_(macOS)
21:16 < Dune> is that just a user setting?
21:16 < Dune> or are signatures really enforced?
21:17 < Oy> i think it's planned that programs must be code signed
21:17 < Oy> next year?
21:19 < Oy> https://github.com/Dune-jr/teeworlds/commit/7ebd6121e6acbdba209292a48d1be170c2ea92cd sorts by player count?
21:20 < Dune> yes
21:20 < Dune> don't think I can make that more clear
21:21 < Oy> yeah then do that
21:21 < Oy> maybe open the all tab on default too?
21:42 < Dune> yeah
22:22 < Oy> https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2300 why is that required?
22:22 < Oy> worked without it for all releases so far
22:23 < Dune> @ChillerDragon
22:24 < Dune> when Chiller compiled, we got https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/517995351358046209/651490597349228544/Bildschirmfoto_2019-12-03_um_19.30.58.png
22:26 < Oy> looks good
22:27 < redix> i'll try to fix the demo thing over the weekend. the demo/snapshot code also has some issues that might be security related =\
22:27 < Dune> he said /usr/local/opt
22:27 < Dune>  is from brew
22:27 < Dune> redix, oh sounds good :)
22:29 < redix> the demo player just loads the snapshot without any validation of the data. pretty sure this can be used for some buffer owerflow
22:29 < redix> overflow*
22:29 < Oy> yeah, that's brew. u have to run https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/blob/master/scripts/make_release.py the it creates the bundle, includes the libs in there and changes the paths to the included libs
22:29 < Oy> redix: that's good :)
22:30 < Dune> ho nice 
22:30 < Dune> @ChillerDragon looks like your compiled client would work
23:06 < bridge_> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> yea i said im not sure xd
