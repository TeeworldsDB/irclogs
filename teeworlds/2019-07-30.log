14:37 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> how does irc work? .-.
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> uhm do we have a preprocessor thing that checks for the build system
14:38 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> because i cant fix my code to work with bam and cmake at the same time :c
21:15 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> @ChillerDragon what's the problem?
22:55 < Dune> day, do you remember if you can bind tee movement on a joystick while having aim on the other? @Iman

23:36 < bridge> [teeworlds] <ChillerDragon> @heinrich5991 ohhi yea i am trying to compile my headless client and if i use the weird sdl main for macos cmake doesnt compile and if i dont use it bam doesnt compile

23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> you could compare the exact commands being executed I guess
23:44 < bridge> [teeworlds] <heinrich5991> that's how I tried to get cmake to work
