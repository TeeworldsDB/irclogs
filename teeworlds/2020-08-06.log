12:48 < ChillerDragon> @redix i dont want to be pushy but im kinda waiting for you to look into the delta unpack error :D are you planning to do something about it? :)
12:49 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> Oops... Forgot to create the PR :D
12:53 < ChillerDragon> thats why im here :D
12:53 < ChillerDragon> no pressure tho
13:39 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> *pressure intensifies*
15:20 < ChillerDragon> uhm @redix https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/pull/2681 thats nice and all but thats not what i meant xd
15:22 < ChillerDragon> I can not merge my client with vanilla because https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/293209e7227c81e92b99c89890ebfdc264374a4a breaks compability with ddnet7 and F-DDrace servers I thought you have some ideas about that
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> @ChillerDragon didn't really read your message, sorry :D
15:34 < bridge> [teeworlds] <redix> I'll check that tomorrow. kinda busy today...
15:34 < ChillerDragon> cool no worries i just wanted to make sure your planning to look into it :)
16:11 < bridge> [teeworlds] <Learath2> ChillerDragon: It's quite a trivial fix, you can DIY
16:19 < ChillerDragon> @Learath2 im not really motivated looking into these protocol extensions or what ever the cause is tbh i dont even understand what the issue is. It might be easy for you but i have no idea.
16:20 < ChillerDragon> if i try to mess with these things it usually goes wrong
20:36 < ChillerDragon> is Oy german lol?
21:03 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> fake news
21:04 < bridge> [teeworlds] <jxsl13> let's speculate about Oy actually being matricks alter ego.
21:30 < ChillerDragon> o.O
21:31 < ChillerDragon> i wonder if he occaisonally greps irc logs for offline pings
