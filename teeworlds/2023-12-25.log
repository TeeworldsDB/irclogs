00:42 < bridge> <patiga> well pretty much any parsing can be boiled down to "reading the binary" ^^
00:43 < ChillerDragon> its not using "zip" compression is it?
00:57 < bridge> <patiga> its using zlib
01:04 < bridge> <jxsl13> zlib is gzip if I'm not mistaken
01:05 < minus> zip, zlib and gzip all use DEFLATE compression but the formats are different
01:06 < bridge> <jxsl13> (Y)
01:07 < minus> zlib has a 2 byte header, gzip is a bit more and zip due to storing more than just a blob of data has a much larger header
01:20 < ChillerDragon> i somehow thought the map format and demo use some custom tw datafile format and not something standard
01:24 < bridge> <patiga> ChillerDragon they do use custom formats, there are just segments of data which need to be decompressed with zlib
01:33 < ChillerDragon> i see
08:19 < bridge> <blade67> Oh, so they're partials! That explains the extension thing! As always, dear old Patiga to the rescue. Merry Christmas!
11:54 < bridge> <patiga> @blade67 Merry Christmas! ❤️
