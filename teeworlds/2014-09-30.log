09:05 <@minus> what's that
10:14 < heinrich5991> it marks that reaching this point in code is undefined behaviour
11:43 < KinG_> hi all
11:43 < KinG_> guys we are having problems wih seeing serverlist from iran u guys know what's the problem?
11:46 < KinG_> anyone here? ^^
11:55 <@matricks> dunno :)
12:23 < KinG_> ok tnx
19:48 < heinrich5991> matricks: did you have something you modeled teeworlds' network?
19:48 < heinrich5991> I mean an example where it is similar or so?
20:36 <@matricks> quake 3
20:37 <@minus> stealing IP!
20:37 <@minus> sue the man!
20:41 <@matricks> brian hook explained it on his web site
20:41 <@matricks> http://trac.bookofhook.com/bookofhook/trac.cgi/wiki/Quake3Networking
20:42 <@minus> that looksâ€¦ very brief
20:43 <@matricks> under the Quake3 topic it explains how the whole snapshot stuff works
20:45 <@minus> tl;dr. is it based on statistics?
20:45 < heinrich5991> " With Quake3 he dropped the notion of a reliable packet altogether"
20:45 < heinrich5991> teeworlds does have reliable chunks though
20:46 <@matricks> heinrich5991: yup
20:47 <@matricks> heinrich5991: it's inspired, not copied
20:47 <@matricks> I did some stuff to make the delta compression easy etc
20:47 <@minus> "i can do this better" or "i don't need this part"?
20:47 <@matricks> a bit of both, and some stuff that article doesn't explain
20:48 <@matricks> I make the snapshot extreamly simple by just using 32bit ints for example
20:50 < heinrich5991> the snapshot things have a layering violation though (probably for using less memory), they know what objects the game will make
20:55 < heinrich5991> at some point I'll try to understand the delta stuff, I guess it's pretty nifty
20:55 < heinrich5991> I just noticed the above when client and server had different ideas of available netobjects
20:56 <@minus> http://www.storm2d.net/images/gifs/0.050/0.050_trailer_2_xvid_2.gif
20:57 < heinrich5991> what does that depict?
20:57 <@minus> destructible environment in Storm2D
20:57 <@minus> a game that basically copies Soldat but is written in Java instead of Delphi
20:58 < heinrich5991> yay..
20:58 < heinrich5991> delphi is pretty low-level afair
